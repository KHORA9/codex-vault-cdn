Her yoke was easy and her burden was light; our fathers were a\r\nhundred times better off in 1775 than were the men of Kent, the vanguard\r\nof liberty in England. There was more happiness in Middlesex on the\r\nConcord, than there was in Middlesex on the Thames.\"[1] A few years\r\nlater Hon. Edward B. Callender, a Republican candidate for mayor of\r\nBoston, in his campaign speech said: \"I know something about how this\r\ncity started. It was not made by the rich men or the so-called\r\nhigh-toned men of Boston--they were with the other party, with the king;\r\nthey were Loyalists. Boston was founded by the ordinary man--by Paul\r\nRevere, the coppersmith; Sam Adams, the poor collector of the town of\r\nBoston, who did not hand over to the town even the sums he collected as\r\ntaxes; by John Hancock, the smuggler of rum; by John Adams, the\r\nattorney, who naively remarked in his book that after the battle of\r\nLexington they never heard anything about the suits against John\r\nHancock. Those were settled.\"[2]\r\n\r\n  [1] Speech of Senator Hoar at South Boston, March 18, 1901.\r\n\r\n  [2] Speech of Hon. Edward B. Callender, at Dorchester, Nov. 10, 1905.\r\n\r\nThese words of our venerable and learned senator and our State Senator\r\nEdward B. Callender, seemed strangely unfamiliar to us who had derived\r\nour history of the Revolution from the school text-books. These had\r\ntaught us that the Revolution was due solely to the oppression and\r\ntyranny of the British, and that Washington, Franklin, Adams, Hancock,\r\nOtis, and the host of other Revolutionary patriots, had in a supreme\r\ndegree all the virtues ever exhibited by men in their respective\r\nspheres, and that the Tories or Loyalists, such as Hutchinson, the\r\nOlivers, Saltonstalls, Winslows, Quincys and others, were to be detested\r\nand their memory execrated for their abominable and unpatriotic actions.\r\n\r\nThis led me to inquire and to examine whether there might not be two\r\nsides to the controversy which led to the Revolutionary War. I soon\r\nfound that for more than a century our most gifted writers had almost\r\nuniformly suppressed or misrepresented all matter bearing upon one side\r\nof the question, and that it would seem to be settled by precedent that\r\nthis nation could not be trusted with all portions of its own history.\r\nBut it seemed to me that history should know no concealment. The people\r\nhave a right to the whole truth, and to the full benefit of unbiased\r\nhistorical teachings, and if, in an honest attempt to discharge a duty\r\nto my fellow citizens, I relate on unquestionable authority facts that\r\npolitic men have intentionally concealed, let no man say that I wantonly\r\nexpose the errors of the fathers.\r\n\r\nIn these days we are recognizing more fully than ever the dignity of\r\nhistory, we are realizing that patriotism is not the sole and ultimate\r\nobject of its study, but the search for truth, and abiding by the truth\r\nwhen found, for \"the truth shall make you free\" is an axiom that applies\r\nhere as always.\r\n\r\nMuch of the ill will towards England which until recently existed in\r\ngreat sections of the American people, and which the mischief-making\r\npolitician could confidently appeal to, sprung from a false view of what\r\nthe American Revolution was, and the history of England was, in\r\nconnection with it. The feeling of jealousy and anger, which was born in\r\nthe throes of the struggle for independence, we indiscriminately\r\nperpetuated by false and superficial school text-books. The influence of\r\nfalse history and of crude one-sided history is enormous. It is a\r\nnatural and logical step that when our children pass from our schoolroom\r\ninto active life, feelings so born should die hard and at times become a\r\ndangerous factor in the national life, and it is not too much to say\r\nthat the persistent ill will towards England as compared with the\r\nuniversal kindliness of English feeling towards us, is to be explained\r\nby the very different spirit in which the history of the American\r\nRevolution is taught in the schools of one country and in those of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James H Stark with signature]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOYALISTS OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\r\nAND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n_THE FIRST CHARTER._\r\n\r\n\r\nA nation's own experience should be its best political guide, but it is\r\nnot certain that as a people we have improved by all the teachings of\r\nour own history, for the reason that our \"patriot\" writers and orators\r\nmostly bound their vision in retrospect by the revolutionary era. And\r\nyet, all beyond that is not dark, barren, and profitless to explore. It\r\nshould be known that the most important truths on which our free forms\r\nof government now rest are not primarily the discoveries of the\r\nrevolutionary sages.\r\n\r\nWriting of the Revolution, Mr. John Adams, the successor of Washington,\r\ndeclared that it was his opinion that the Revolution \"began as early as\r\nthe first plantation of the country,\" and that \"independence of church\r\nand state was the fundamental principle of the first colonization, has\r\nbeen its principle for two hundred years, and now I hope is past\r\ndispute. Who was the author, inventor, discoverer of independence? The\r\nonly true answer must be, the first emigrants.\" Before this time he had\r\ndeclared that \"The claim of the men of 1776 to the honor of first\r\nconceiving the idea of American independence or of first inventing the\r\nproject of it, is ridiculous. I hereby disclaim all pretension to it,\r\nbecause it was much more ancient than my nativity.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the inestimable fortune of our ancestors to have been taught the\r\ndifficulties of government in two distinct schools, under the Colonial\r\nand Provincial charters, known as the first and second charters. The\r\nCharter government as moulded and modelled by our ancestors, was as\r\nperfect as is our own constitution of today. It was as tender of common\r\nright, as antagonistic to special privilege to classes or interests, and\r\nas sensitive, too, to popular impulses, good or evil. And it is thus in\r\nall self-governing communities, that their weal or woe, being supposedly\r\nin their own keeping, the freest forms of delegated government written\r\non parchment are in themselves no protection, but will be such\r\ninstruments of blessing or of destruction as may best gratify the\r\ncontrolling influences or interests for the time being.\r\n\r\nIn tracing the origin and development of the sentiment and the desires,\r\nthe fears and the prejudices which culminated in the American\r\nRevolution, in the separation of thirteen colonies from Great Britain,\r\nit is necessary to notice the early settlement and progress of those New\r\nEngland colonies in which the seeds of that Revolution were first sown\r\nand nurtured to maturity. The Colonies of New England were the result of\r\ntwo distinct emigrations of English Puritans, two classes of Puritans,\r\ntwo distinct governments for more than sixty years--one class of these\r\nemigrants, now known as the \"Pilgrim Fathers,\" having first fled from\r\nEngland to Holland, thence emigrated to New England in 1620 in \"the\r\nMayflower,\" and named their place of settlement \"New Plymouth.\" Here\r\nthey elected seven governors in succession, and existed under a\r\nself-constituted government for seventy years. The second class was\r\ncalled \"Puritan Fathers.\" The first installment of their immigrants\r\narrived in 1629, under Endicott, the ancestor of Mr. Joseph\r\nChamberlain's wife. They were known as the \"Massachusetts Bay Company,\"\r\nand their final capital was Boston, which afterwards became the capital\r\nof the Province and of the State.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of the separate and independent governments of these\r\ntwo classes of Puritans were widely different. The one was tolerant,\r\nnon-persecuting, and loyal to the King, during the whole period of its\r\nseventy years' existence; the other was an intolerant persecutor of all\r\nreligionists who did not adopt its worship, and disloyal, from the\r\nbeginning, to the government from which it held its Charter, and\r\nsedulously sowed and cultivated the seeds of disaffection and hostility\r\nto the Royal government until they grew and ripened into the harvest of\r\nthe American Revolution.\r\n\r\nEnglish Puritanism, transferred from England to the head of\r\nMassachusetts Bay in 1629, presents the same characteristics which it\r\ndeveloped in England. In Massachusetts it had no competitor, it\r\ndeveloped its principles and spirit without restraint; it was absolute\r\nin power from 1629 to 1689. During these sixty years it assumed\r\nindependence of the government to which it owed its corporate existence;\r\nit made it a penal crime for any immigrant to appeal to England against\r\na local decision of courts or of government; it permitted no oath of\r\nallegiance to the King, nor the administration of the laws in his name;\r\nit allowed no elective franchise to any Episcopalian, Presbyterian,\r\nBaptist, Quaker or Papist. Every non-member of the Congregational church\r\nwas compelled to pay taxes and bear all other Puritan burdens, but was\r\nallowed no representation by franchise, nor had he eligibility for any\r\npublic office.\r\n\r\nWhen the Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Company emigrated from\r\nEngland, they professed to be members of the Church of England, but\r\nEndicott, who had imbibed views of church government and of forms of\r\nworship, determined not to perpetuate here the worship of the\r\nEstablished Church, to which he had professed to belong when he left\r\nEngland, but to establish a new church with a new form of worship. He\r\nseemed to have brought over some thirty of the immigrants to his new\r\nscheme, but a majority either stood aloof from, or were opposed to his\r\nextraordinary proceeding. Among the most noted adherents of the old\r\nChurch of the Reformation were two brothers, John and Samuel Brown, who\r\nrefused to be parties to this new and locally devised church revolution,\r\nand resolved for themselves, their families, and such as thought with\r\nthem, to continue to worship God according to the custom of their\r\nfathers.\r\n\r\nIt is the fashion of many American historians, as well as their echoes\r\nin England, to apply epithets of contumely or scorn to these men. Both\r\nthe Browns were men of wealth, one a lawyer, the other a private\r\ngentleman, and both of them were of a social position in England much\r\nsuperior to that of Endicott. They were among the original patentees and\r\nfirst founders of the colony; they were church reformers, but neither of\r\nthem a church revolutionist. The brothers were brought before the\r\nGovernor, who informed them that New England was no place for such as\r\nthey, and therefore he sent them both back to England, on the return of\r\nthe ships the same year.\r\n\r\nEndicott resolved to admit of no opposition. They who could not be\r\nterrified into silence were not commanded to withdraw, but were seized\r\nand banished as criminals.[3]\r\n\r\n  [3] Mass. His. Soc. Vol. ix-3-5.\r\n\r\nA year later John Winthrop was appointed to supersede Endicott as\r\nGovernor. On his departure with a fleet of eleven ships from England an\r\naddress to their \"Fathers and Brethren of the Church of England\" was\r\npublished by Winthrop from his ship, the Arbella, disclaiming the acts\r\nof some among them hostile to the Church of England, declaring their\r\nobligations and attachment to it. He said: \"We desire you would be\r\npleased to take notice of the principles and body of our Company as\r\nthose who esteem it an honor to call the Church of England, from whence\r\nwe rise, our dear Mother, and cannot part from our native countrie,\r\nwhere she especially resideth, without much sadness of heart and many\r\ntears in our eyes.\" It might be confidently expected that Mr. Winthrop,\r\nafter this address of loyalty and affection to his Father and Brethren\r\nof the Church of England, would, on his arrival at Massachusetts Bay,\r\nand assuming its government, have rectified the wrongs of Endicott and\r\nhis party, and have secured at least freedom of worship to the children\r\nof his \"dear Mother.\" But he did nothing of the kind; he seems to have\r\nfallen in with the very proceedings of Endicott which had been\r\ndisclaimed by him in his address.\r\n\r\nThus was the first seed sown, which germinated for one hundred and\r\nthirty years, and then ripened in the American Revolution. It was the\r\nopening wedge which shivered the transatlantic branches from the parent\r\nstock. It was the consciousness of having abused the Royal confidence,\r\nand broken faith with their Sovereign, of having acted contrary to the\r\nlaws and statutes of England, that led the Government of Massachusetts\r\nBay to resist and evade all inquiries into their proceedings; to prevent\r\nall evidence from being transmitted to England, and to punish as\r\ncriminals all who should appeal to England against any of their\r\nproceedings; to claim, in short, independence and immunity from all\r\nresponsibility to the Crown for anything they did or might do. This\r\nspirit of tyranny and intolerance, of proscription and persecution,\r\ncaused all the disputes with the parent Government, and all the\r\nbloodshed on account of religion in Massachusetts, which its Government\r\ninflicted in subsequent years, in contradistinction to the Governments\r\nof Plymouth, Rhode Island, Connecticut and even Maryland.\r\n\r\nThe church government established by the Puritans at Boston was not a\r\ngovernment of free citizens elected by a free citizen suffrage, or even\r\nof property qualification, but was the \"reign of the church, the members\r\nof which constituted but about one-sixth of the population, five-sixths\r\nbeing mere helots bound to do the work and pay the taxes imposed upon\r\nthem by the reigning church but denied all eligibility to any office in\r\nthe Commonwealth.\" It was indeed such a \"connection between church and\r\nstate\" as had never existed in any Protestant country; it continued for\r\nsixty years, until suppressed by a second Royal Charter, as will appear\r\nin the next chapter.\r\n\r\nThe Puritans were far from being the fathers of American Liberty. They\r\nneither understood nor practiced the first principles of civil and\r\nreligious liberty nor the rights of British subjects as then understood\r\nand practiced in the land they had left \"for conscience sake.\"\r\n\r\nThe first Charter obtained of Charles I. is still in existence, and can\r\nbe seen in the Secretary's Office at the State House, Boston. A\r\nduplicate copy of this Charter was sent over in 1629 to Governor\r\nEndicott, at Salem, and is now in the Salem Athenaeum.\r\n\r\nIf the conditions of the Charter had been observed the colonists would\r\nhave been independent indeed, and would have enjoyed extraordinary\r\nprivileges for those times. They would have had the freest government in\r\nthe world. They were allowed to elect their own governor and members of\r\nthe General Court, and the government of the Colony was but little\r\ndifferent from that of the State today, so far as the rights conferred\r\nby the charter were concerned. The people were subjects of the Crown in\r\nname, but in reality were masters of their own public affairs. The\r\nnumber of the early emigrants to New England who renounced allegiance to\r\nthe mother church was exceedingly small, for the obvious reason that it\r\nwas at the same time a renunciation of their allegiance to the Crown. A\r\ncompany of restless spirits had been got rid of, and whether they\r\nconformed to all the laws of church and state or not, they were three\r\nthousand miles away and could not be easily brought to punishment even\r\nif they deserved it, or be made to mend the laws if they broke them. The\r\nrestriction of subjecting those who wished to emigrate to the oaths of\r\nallegiance and supremacy did not last long. Those who chose \"disorderly\r\nto leave the Kingdom\" did so, and thus what they gained in that kind of\r\nliberty is a loss to their descendants who happen to be antiquaries and\r\ngenealogists.\r\n\r\nUnder the charter they were allowed to make laws or ordinances for the\r\ngovernment of the plantation, which should not be repugnant to the laws\r\nof England; all subjects of King Charles were to be allowed to come\r\nhere; and these emigrants and their posterity were declared \"to be\r\nnatural-born subjects, and entitled to the immunities of Englishmen.\"\r\nThe time of the principal emigration was auspicious. The rise of the\r\ncivil war in England gave its rulers all the work they could do at home.\r\nThe accession of Oliver Cromwell to the Protectorate was regarded very\r\nfavorably by the colonists, who belonged to the same political party,\r\nand they took advantage of this state of affairs to oppress all others\r\nwho had opinions different from their own. The Quakers, both men and\r\nwomen, were persecuted, and treated with great severity; many were hung,\r\na number of them were whipped at the cart's tail through the town, and\r\nthen driven out into the wilderness; others had their ears cut off, and\r\nother cruelties were perpetrated of a character too horrible to be here\r\nrelated. It was in vain that these poor Quakers demanded wherein they\r\nhad broken any laws of England. They were answered with additional\r\nstripes for their presumption, and not without good reason did they\r\nexclaim against \"such monstrous illegality,\" and that such \"great\r\ninjustice was never heard of before.\" Magna Charta, they said, was\r\ntrodden down and the guaranties of the Colonial Charter were utterly\r\ndisregarded.\r\n\r\nThe following is a striking example of the very many atrocities\r\ncommitted by the authorities at that time: \"Nicholas Upshall, an old\r\nman, full of years, seeing their cruelty to the harmless Quakers and\r\nthat they had condemned some of them to die, bothe he and Elder Wiswell,\r\nor otherwise Deacon Wiswell, members of the church in Boston, bore their\r\ntestimony in publick against their brethren's horrid cruelty to said\r\nQuakers. And Upshall declared, '_That he did look at it as a sad\r\nforerunner of some heavy judgment to follow upon the country_.'... Which\r\nthey took so ill at his hands that they fined him twenty pounds and\r\nthree pound more at their courts, for not coming to this meeting and\r\nwould not abate him one grote, but imprisoned him and then banished him\r\non pain of death, which was done in a time of such extreme bitter\r\nweather for frost, and snow, and cold, that had not the _Heathen\r\nIndians_ in the wilderness woods taken compassion on his misery, for the\r\nwinter season, he in all likelihood had perished, though he had then in\r\nBoston a good estate, in houses and land, goods and money, as also wife\r\nand children, but not suffered to come unto him, nor he to them.\"[4]\r\n\r\n  [4] \"Persecutors Maul'd With Their Own Weapons,\" p. 41. See also Court\r\n  Records, 1662.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Oliver Cromwell, Charles II. was proclaimed in London\r\nthe lawful King of England, and the news of it in due time reached\r\nBoston. It was a sad day to many, and they received the intelligence\r\nwith sorrow and concern, for they saw that a day of retribution would\r\ncome. But there was no alternative, and the people of Boston made up\r\ntheir minds to submit to a power they could not control. They, however,\r\nkept a sort of sullen silence for a time, but fearing this might be\r\nconstrued into contempt, or of opposition to the King, they formally\r\nproclaimed him, in August, 1661, more than a year after news of the\r\nRestoration had come. Meanwhile the Quakers in England had obtained the\r\nKing's ear, and their representations against the government at Boston\r\ncaused the King to issue a letter to the governor, requiring him to\r\ndesist from any further proceedings against them, and calling upon the\r\ngovernment here to answer the complaints made by the Quakers. A ship was\r\nchartered, and Samuel Shattock, who had been banished, was appointed to\r\ncarry the letter, and had the satisfaction of delivering it to the\r\ngovernor with his own hand. After perusing it, Mr. Endicott replied, \"We\r\nshall obey his Majesty's command,\" and then issued orders for the\r\ndischarge of all Quakers then in prison. The requisition of the king for\r\nsome one to appear to answer the complaints against the government of\r\nBoston, caused much agitation in the General Court; and when it was\r\ndecided to send over agents, it was not an easy matter to procure\r\nsuitable persons, so sensible was everybody that the complaints to be\r\nanswered had too much foundation to be easily excused, or by any\r\nsubterfuge explained away. It is worthy of note that the two persons\r\nfinally decided upon (Mr. Bradstreet and Mr. Norton) were men who had\r\nbeen the most forward in the persecutions of the Quakers. And had it not\r\nbeen for the influence which Lord Saye and Seale of the king's Council,\r\nand Col. Wm. Crowne, had with Charles II., the colony would have felt\r\nhis early and heavy displeasure. Col. Crowne was in Boston when Whalley\r\nand Goffe, the regicides, arrived here, and he could have made\r\nstatements regarding their reception, and the persecution of the\r\nQuakers, which might have caused the king to take an entirely different\r\ncourse from the mild and conciliatory one which, fortunately for Boston,\r\nwas taken. Having \"graciously\" received the letter from the hands of the\r\nagents, and, although he confirmed the Patent and Charter, objects of\r\ngreat and earnest solicitude in their letter to him, yet \"he required\r\nthat all their laws should be reviewed, and that such as were contrary\r\nor derogatory to the king's authority should be annulled; that the oath\r\nof allegiance should be administered; that administration of justice\r\nshould be in the king's name; that liberty should be given to all who\r\ndesired it, to use the Book of Common Prayer; in short, establishing\r\nreligious freedom in Boston.\" This was not all--the elective franchise\r\nwas extended \"to all freeholders of competent estates,\" if they\r\nsustained good moral characters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANDING OF THE COMMISSIONERS AT BOSTON, 1664.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Commissioners were appointed to hold Court and correct\r\nwhatever errors and abuses they might discover.]\r\n\r\nThe return of the agents to New England, bearing such mandates from the\r\nking, was the cause of confusion and dismay to the whole country.\r\nInstead of being thankful for such lenity, many were full of\r\nresentment and indignation, and most unjustly assailed the agents for\r\nfailing to accomplish an impossibility.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile four ships had sailed from Portsmouth, with about four hundred\r\nand fifty soldiers, with orders to proceed against the Dutch in the New\r\nNetherlands (New York), and then to land the commissioners at Boston and\r\nenforce the king's authority. The Dutch capitulated, and the expedition\r\nthus far was completely successful. The commissioners landed in Boston\r\non Feb. 15th, 1664, and held a Court to correct whatever errors and\r\nabuses they might discover. The commission was composed of the following\r\ngentlemen: Col. Richard Nichols, who commanded the expedition; Sir\r\nRobert Carr, Col. Geo. Cartwright and Mr. Samuel Maverick. Maverick had\r\nfor several years made his home on Noddle Island (now known as East\r\nBoston), but, like his friends, Blackstone of Beacon Hill and other of\r\nthe earliest settlers, had been so harshly and ungenerously treated by\r\nthe Puritan colonists of Boston that he was compelled to remove from his\r\nisland domain. An early adventurous visitor to these shores mentions him\r\nin his diary as \"the only hospitable man in all the country.\" These\r\ngentlemen held a commission from the king constituting them\r\ncommissioners for visiting the colonies of New England, to hear and\r\ndetermine all matters of complaint, and to settle the peace and security\r\nof the country, any three or two of them being a quorum.\r\n\r\nThe magistrates of Boston having assembled, the commissioners made known\r\ntheir mission, and added that so far was the king from wishing to\r\nabridge their liberties, he was ready to enlarge them, but wished them\r\nto show, by proper representation of their loyalty, reasons to remove\r\nall causes of jealousy from their royal master. But it was of no avail;\r\nthe word loyalty had been too long expunged from their vocabulary to\r\nfind a place in it again. At every footstep the commissioners must have\r\nseen that whatever they effected, and whatever impressions they made,\r\nwould prove but little better than footprints in the sand. The\r\ngovernment thought best to comply with their requirements, so far, at\r\nleast, as appearances were concerned. They therefore agreed that their\r\nallegiance to the king should be published \"by sound of trumpet;\" that\r\nMr. Oliver Purchis should proclaim the same on horseback, and that Mr.\r\nThomas Bligh, Treasurer, and Mr. Richard Wait, should accompany him;\r\nthat the reading in every place should end with the words, \"God save the\r\nKing!\" Another requirement of the commissioners was that the government\r\nshould stop coining money; that Episcopalians should not be fined for\r\nnon-attendance at the religious meetings of the community, as they had\r\nhitherto been; that they should let the Quakers alone, and permit them\r\nto go about their own affairs. These were only a part of the\r\nrequirements, but they were the principal ones. Notwithstanding a\r\npretended acquiescence on the part of the government to the requests of\r\nthe commissioners, it was evident from the first that little could be\r\neffected by them from the evasive manner in which all their orders and\r\nrecommendations were accepted. At length the commissioners found it\r\nnecessary to put the question to the Governor and Council direct,\r\n\"Whether they acknowledged his Majesty's Commission?\" The Court sent\r\nthem a message, desiring to be excused from giving a direct answer,\r\ninasmuch as their charter was their plea. Being still pressed for a\r\ndirect answer, they declared that \"it was enough for them to give their\r\nsense of the powers granted them by charter, and that it was beyond\r\ntheir line to determine the power, intent, or purpose of his Majesty's\r\ncommission.\" The authorities then issued a proclamation calling upon the\r\npeople, in his Majesty's name (!), not to consent unto, or give\r\napprobation to the proceedings of the King's Commission, nor to aid or\r\nto abet them. This proclamation was published through the town by sound\r\nof trumpet, and, oddly enough, added thereto \"_God save the King_.\" The\r\ncommissioners then sent a threatening protest, saying they thought the\r\nking and his council knew what was granted to them in their charter; but\r\nthat since they would misconstrue everything, they would lose no more of\r\ntheir labor upon them; at the same time assuring them that their denial\r\nof the king's authority, as vested in his commission, would be\r\nrepresented to his Majesty only in their own words. The conduct of Col.\r\nNichols, at Boston, is spoken of in terms of high commendation; but\r\nMaverick, Carr and Cartwright are represented as totally unfitted for\r\ntheir business. It is, however, difficult to see how any commissioners,\r\nupon such an errand, could have given greater satisfaction; for a\r\nmoment's consideration is sufficient to convince any one that the\r\ndifficulty was not so much in the commissioners, as in their\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nAfter the return of the commissioners to England the government\r\ncontinued their persecutions of the Quakers, Baptists, Episcopalians,\r\nand all others who held opinions differing from their own. The laws of\r\nEngland regulating trade were entirely disregarded; the reason alleged\r\ntherefor being, \"that the acts of navigation were an invasion of the\r\nrights and privileges of the subjects of his Majesty's colony, they not\r\nbeing represented in Parliament.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the king wrote to the authorities of Boston, requiring them not to\r\nmolest the people, in their worship, who were of the Protestant faith,\r\nand directing that liberty of conscience should be extended to all. This\r\nletter was dated July 24th, 1679. It had some effect on the rulers; but\r\nthey had become so accustomed to what they called interference from\r\nEngland, and at the same time so successful in evading it, that to stop\r\nnow seemed, to the majority of the people, as well as the rulers, not\r\nonly cowardly, but an unworthy relinquishment of privileges which they\r\nhad always enjoyed, and which they were at all times ready to assert, as\r\nguaranteed to them in their charter. However, there was a point beyond\r\nwhich even Bostonians could not go, and which after-experience proved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RANDOLPH THREATENED.\r\n\r\nThis Royal Commissioner reported that he was in danger of his life, and\r\nthat the authorities resolved to prosecute him as a subverter of their\r\ngovernment.]\r\n\r\nEdward Randolph brought the king's letter to Boston, and was required to\r\nmake a report concerning the state of affairs in the colony, and to see\r\nthat the laws of England were properly executed; but he did not fare\r\nwell in his mission. He wrote home that every one was saying they were\r\nnot subject to the laws of England, and that those laws were of no force\r\nin Massachusetts until confirmed by the Legislature of the colony.\r\n\r\nEvery day aggravated his disposition more strongly against the people,\r\nwho used their utmost endeavors to irritate his temper and frustrate his\r\ndesigns. Any one supporting him was accounted an enemy of the country.\r\n\r\nHis servants were beaten while watching for the landing of contraband\r\ngoods. Going on board a vessel to seize it, he was threatened to be\r\nknocked on the head, and the offending ship was towed away by Boston\r\nboats. Randolph returned to England, reporting that he was in danger of\r\nhis life, and that the authorities were resolved to prosecute him as a\r\nsubserver of their government. If they could, they would execute him;\r\nimprisonment was the least he expected. Well might the historian\r\nexclaim, as one actually did, \"To what a state of degradation was a king\r\nof England reduced!\" his commissioners, one after another, being\r\nthwarted, insulted and obliged to return home in disgrace, and his\r\nauthority openly defied. What was the country to expect when this state\r\nof affairs should be laid before the king? A fleet of men-of-war to\r\nbring it to its duty? Perhaps some expected this; but there came again,\r\ninstead, the evil genius of the colony, Edward Randolph, bringing from\r\nthe king the dreaded _quo warranto_. This was Randolph's hour of\r\ntriumph; he said \"he would now make the whole faction tremble,\" and he\r\ngloried in their confusion and the success which had attended his\r\nefforts to humble the people of Boston. To give him consequence a\r\nfrigate brought him, and as she lay before the town the object of her\r\nemployment could not be mistaken. An attempt was made, however, to\r\nprevent judgment being rendered on the return of the writ of _quo\r\nwarranto_. An attorney was sent to England, with a very humble address,\r\nto appease the king, and to answer for the country, but all to no\r\npurpose. Judgment was rendered, and thus ended the first charter of\r\nMassachusetts, Oct. 23rd, 1684.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n_THE SECOND CHARTER._\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles II. died Feb. 6th, 1685, and was succeeded by his brother, James\r\nII. News of this was brought to Boston by private letter, but no\r\nofficial notification was made to the governor. In a letter to him,\r\nhowever, he was told that he was not written to as governor, for as much\r\nas now he had no government, the charter being vacated. These events\r\nthrew the people of Boston into great uncertainty and trouble as to what\r\nthey were in future to expect from England. Orders were received to\r\nproclaim the new king, which was done \"with sorrowful and affected\r\npomp,\" at the town house. The ceremony was performed in the presence of\r\neight military companies of the town, and \"three volleys of cannon\" were\r\ndischarged. Sir Edmund Andros, the new Royal Governor, arrived in Boston\r\nDec. 20th, 1686, and, as was to be expected, he was not regarded\r\nfavorably by the people, especially as his first act after landing was a\r\ndemand for the keys of the Old South Church \"that they may say prayers\r\nthere.\" Such a demand from the new governor could not be tolerated by\r\nthe now superseded governing authority of Boston, and defy it they\r\nwould. The Puritan oligarchy stoutly objected to being deprived of the\r\nright to withhold from others than their own sect the privileges of\r\nreligious liberty. To enjoy religious liberty in full measure they had\r\nmigrated from the home of their fathers, but in New England had become\r\nmore intolerant than the church which they had abandoned, and became as\r\narbitrary as the Spanish inquisition. Under direction of the king,\r\nAndros had come to proclaim the equality of Christian religion in the\r\nnew colonies. Too evidently this was not what was wanted here.\r\n\r\nAt last came the news of the landing of the Prince of Orange in England\r\nand the abdication of James the Second. The people of Boston rose\r\nagainst Andros and his government and seized him and fifty of his\r\nassociates and confined them in the \"Castle\" until February, 1690, when\r\nthey were sent to England for trial; but having committed no offence,\r\nthey were discharged. Andros was received so favorably at home that\r\nunder the new administration he was appointed governor of Virginia and\r\nMaryland. He took over with him the charter of William and Mary college,\r\nand later laid the foundation stone of that great institution of\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROCLAIMING KING WILLIAM AND QUEEN MARY, 1689.\r\n\r\nThis is said to have been the most joyful news ever before received in\r\nBoston.]\r\n\r\nAndros has never received justice from Massachusetts historians. Before\r\nhis long public career ended he had been governor of every Royal\r\nProvince in North America. His services were held in such high esteem\r\nthat he was honored with office by four successive monarchs.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to notice that at last his character and services are\r\nbeginning to be better appreciated in the provinces over which he ruled,\r\nand we may hope that in time the Andros of partisan history will give\r\nplace, even in the popular narratives of colonial affairs, to the Andros\r\nwho really existed, stern, proud and uncompromising it is true, but\r\nhonest, upright and just; a loyal servant of the crown and a friend to\r\nthe best interests of the people.\r\n\r\nNot only were the governor and all of his adherents arrested and thrown\r\ninto jail, but Captain George, of the Rose frigate, being found on\r\nshore, was seized by a party of ship carpenters and handed over to the\r\nguard.\r\n\r\nSo strong was the feeling against the prisoners that it was found\r\nnecessary to guard them against the infuriated people, lest they should\r\nbe torn into pieces by the mob. The insurrection was completely\r\nsuccessful, and the result was that the resumption of the charter was\r\nonce more affirmed. A general court was formed after the old model, and\r\nthe venerable Bradstreet was made governor. Nothing now seemed wanting\r\nto the popular satisfaction but favorable news from England, and that\r\ncame in a day or two. On the 26th of May, 1689, a ship arrived from the\r\nold country with an order to the Massachusetts authorities to proclaim\r\nKing William and Queen Mary. This was done on the 29th, and grave,\r\nPuritanical Boston went wild with joy, and all thanked God that a\r\nProtestant sovereign once more ruled in England. This has been said to\r\nhave been the most joyful news ever before received in Boston.\r\n\r\nMay 14, 1692, Sir William Phipps, a native of Massachusetts, arrived in\r\nBoston from England, bringing with him the new Charter of the province,\r\nand a commission constituting him governor of the same. Unfortunately he\r\ncountenanced and upheld the people in their delusion respecting\r\nwitchcraft, and confirmed the condemnation and execution of the victims.\r\nThe delusion spread like flames among dry leaves in autumn, and in a\r\nshort time the jails in Boston were filled with the accused. During the\r\nprevalence of this moral disease, nineteen persons in the colony were\r\nhanged, and one pressed to death. At last the delusion came to an end,\r\nand the leaders afterwards regretted the part they had taken in it.\r\n\r\nThe new Charter of Massachusetts gave the Province a governor appointed\r\nby the Crown. While preserving its assembly and its town organization,\r\nit tended to encourage and develop, even in that fierce democracy, those\r\nelements of a conservative party which had been called into existence\r\nsome years before by the disloyalty and tyranny of the ecclesiastical\r\noligarchy.\r\n\r\nThus, side by side with a group of men who were constantly regretting\r\ntheir lost autonomy, and looking with suspicion and prejudice at every\r\naction of the royal authorities, there arose another group of men who\r\nconstantly dwelt upon the advantages they derived from their connection\r\nwith the mother country. The Church of England also had at last waked up\r\nto a sense of the spiritual needs of its children beyond the seas. Many\r\nof the best of the laity forsook their separatist principles and\r\nreturned to the historic church of the old home. This influence tended\r\ninevitably to maintain and strengthen the feeling of national unity in\r\nthose of the colonists who came under the ministration of the church. In\r\nall the Royal Provinces there was an official class gradually growing\r\nup, that was naturally imperial rather than local in its sympathy. The\r\nwar with the French, in which colonists fought side by side with\r\n\"regulars\" in a contest of national significance, tended upon the whole\r\nto intensify the sense of imperial unity.\r\n\r\n\"The people of Massachusetts Bay were never in a more easy and happy\r\nsituation than at the conclusion of the war with France in 1749. By\r\ngenerous reimbursement of the whole charge of L183,000 incurred by the\r\nexpedition against Cape Breton, the English government set the Province\r\nfree from a heavy debt by which it must otherwise have remained\r\ninvolved, and enabled by it to exchange a depreciating paper medium,\r\nwhich had long been the sole instrument of trade, for a stable medium of\r\ngold and silver. Soon the advantage of this relief from the heavy burden\r\nof debt was apparent in all branches of their commerce, and excited the\r\nenvy of other colonies, in each of which paper was the principal\r\ncurrency.\"[5]\r\n\r\n  [5] Hutchinson, History Mass. Bay, Vol. III., page 1.\r\n\r\nThe early part of the eighteenth century was filled with wars: France,\r\nEngland and Spain were beginning to overrun the interior of North\r\nAmerica. Spain claimed a zone to the south, and France a vast territory\r\nto the north and west of the English colonies. Each of the three\r\ncountries sought aid from the savage to carry on its enterprises and\r\ndepredations. While the English colonies were beset on the north by the\r\nFrench, on the south by the Spaniards, on the west by native Indians\r\nalong the Alleghany Mountains, and were compelled to depend on the\r\n\"wooden walls of England\" for the protection of their coasts, they were\r\nthen remarkably loyal to the Crown of England. Their representative\r\nassemblies passed obsequious resolutions expressing loyalty and\r\ngratitude to the King, and the people; and erected his statue in a\r\npublic place. This feeling of loyalty remained in the minds of a large\r\nmajority of the people down to the battle of Lexington.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1756, the English government, goaded by the constantly continued\r\nefforts of the French to ignore her treaty obligations in Acadia, and\r\nher ever-harrassing, irritating \"pin-pricks\" on the frontiers of the\r\nEnglish colonies, declared war against France. Long before this official\r\ndeclaration the two countries had been, on this continent, in a state of\r\nactive but covert belligerency. Preparations for an inevitable conflict\r\nwere being made by both sides. French intrigue and French treachery were\r\nmet with English determination to defend the rights of the mother\r\ncountry and of her children here. Money was pledged to the colonies to\r\naid in equipping militia for active service, and the local governments\r\nand the inhabitants of every province became as enthusiastic as the home\r\ngovernment in the prosecution of war.\r\n\r\nOn the northern and western borders of New England and of New York,\r\nalong the thin fringe of advanced English settlements bordering\r\nPennsylvania and Virginia, Indians had long been encouraged or employed\r\nin savage raids, and in Nova Scotia, which, by the treaty of Utrecht had\r\nbeen ceded to England, systematic opposition to English occupation was\r\nconstantly kept up.\r\n\r\nIntriguing agents of the French government, soldiers, priests of the\r\n\"Holy Catholic\" church--all were active in a determined effort to check\r\nand finally crush out the menacing influence and prosperity of the\r\ngrowing English colonies.\r\n\r\nThe ambushing and slaughter of Braddock's force on the Monongahela, the\r\nremoval of Acadians from Annapolis Valley, the defeat of Dieskau at\r\nCrown Point, the siege and occupation of Fort Beausejour, all occurred\r\nbefore the formal declaration of war. Clouds were gathering. Men of\r\nfighting age of the English colonies volunteered in thousands; British\r\nregiments, seasoned in war, were brought from the old country to the\r\nnew, and with them and after them came ships innumerable. A fight for\r\nlife of the English colonies was at hand. The brood of the mistress of\r\nthe seas must not be driven into the ocean. France must be compelled to\r\ngive pledges for the performance of her treaty engagements or find\r\nherself without a foothold in the country.\r\n\r\nWith the hour came the man. Under the direction of the greatest war\r\nminister England had ever seen, or has since seen, William Pitt, the\r\n\"Great Commoner,\" war on France was begun in earnest.\r\n\r\nAt first a few successes were achieved by the French commanders. Fort\r\nWilliam Henry, with its small garrison, surrendered to Montcalm, and\r\nAbercrombie's expedition to Fort Ticonderoga was a disastrous failure.\r\nBut the tide of battle soon turned.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the end came in 1758. Louisbourg, the great fortress\r\nwhich France had made \"The Gibraltar of the West,\" became a prize to the\r\narmy and navy of Britain. New England soldiers formed a part of the\r\ninvesting force on land, and their record in the second capture of\r\nLouisbourg was something to be proud of. Fort Frontenac, on Lake\r\nOntario, was taken, together with armed vessels and a great collection\r\nof stores and implements of war. Fort Duquesne, a strongly fortified\r\npost of the French, whose site is now covered by the great manufacturing\r\ncity of Pittsburgh, surrendered to a British force. For many years after\r\nit was known as Fort Pitt, so called in honor of the great minister\r\nunder whose compelling influence the war against France had become so\r\nmighty a success.\r\n\r\nIn 1759, General Wolfe, who had been the leading spirit in the siege of\r\nLouisbourg, was placed in command of an expedition for the capture of\r\nQuebec. Next after Louisbourg, Quebec was by nature and military art the\r\nstrongest place in North America. The tragic story of the capture of\r\nQuebec has been so often told that it is not necessary for us to repeat\r\nit here.\r\n\r\nOf the long, impatient watch by Wolfe, from the English fleet, for\r\nopportunity to disembark his small army, drifting with the tides of the\r\nSt. Lawrence, passing and repassing the formidable citadel, the stealthy\r\nmidnight landing at the base of a mighty cliff, the hard climb of armed\r\nmen up the wooded height, and the assembly, in early morning mist, on\r\nthe Plains of Abraham, are not for us to write of here. In the glowing\r\npages of Parkman all this is so thrillingly described that we need not\r\nsay more of the most dramatic and most pathetic story in all American\r\nhistory, than that Quebec fell, and with it, in short time, fell the\r\nwhole power of France in North America.\r\n\r\nIn the following year (September 8, 1760), Montreal, the last stronghold\r\nof the French in Canada, capitulated to Sir Jeffrey Amherst, who had\r\nascended the St. Lawrence with a force of about 10,000 men, comprising\r\nBritish regiments of the line artillery, rangers and provincial\r\nregiments from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The provincial\r\ncontingent numbered above four thousand.\r\n\r\nWith the fall of Montreal the seven years' fight for supremacy was\r\nended.\r\n\r\nSuch a defeat to proud France was a bitter experience, and definite\r\nsettlement of the terms of peace, which Great Britain was able to\r\ndictate, was not made until, on the 10th of February, 1763, the treaty\r\nof Paris was signed.\r\n\r\nBy this treaty to Great Britain was ceded all Canada, Nova Scotia, Cape\r\nBreton and the West India Islands of Dominica, St. Vincent, Tobago and\r\nGrenada. Minorca was restored to Great Britain, and to her also was\r\ngiven the French possession of Senegal in Western Africa. In India,\r\nwhere the French had obtained considerable influence, France was bound\r\nby this treaty to raise no fortifications and to keep no military force\r\nin Bengal. To remove the annoyance which Florida had long been to the\r\ncontiguous English colonies, that province of Spain was transferred to\r\nthe English in exchange for Havana, which had been only recently wrested\r\nfrom the occupation of Spain by the brilliant victory of Pocock and\r\nAlbamarle.\r\n\r\nAnd so 1763 saw the British flag peacefully waving from the Gulf of\r\nMexico to the northern shores of Hudson's Bay. The coast of the Atlantic\r\nwas protected by the British navy, and the colonists had no longer\r\nforeign enemies to fear.\r\n\r\nFor this relief the colonists gave warm thanks to the king and to\r\nparliament. Massachusetts voted a costly monument in Westminster Abbey\r\nin memory of Lord Howe, who had fallen in the campaign against Canada.\r\nThe assembly of the same colony, in a joyous address to the governor,\r\ndeclared that without the assistance of the parent state the colonies\r\nmust have fallen a prey to the power of France, and that without money\r\nsent from England the burden of the war would have been too great to\r\nbear. In an address to the king they made the same acknowledgment, and\r\npledged themselves to demonstrate their gratitude by every possible\r\ntestimony of duty and loyalty. James Otis expressed the common sentiment\r\nof the hour when, upon being chosen moderator of the first town meeting\r\nheld in Boston after the peace, he declared: \"We in America have\r\ncertainly abundant reason to rejoice. Not only are the heathen driven\r\nout, but the Canadians, much more formidable enemies, are conquered and\r\nbecome fellow subjects. The British dominion and power can now be said\r\nliterally to extend from sea to sea and from the Great River to the ends\r\nof the earth.\" And after praising the wise administration of His\r\nMajesty, and lauding the British constitution to the skies, he went on\r\nto say: \"Those jealousies which some weak and wicked minds endeavored to\r\ninfuse with regard to these colonies, had their birth in the blackness\r\nof darkness, and it is a great pity that they had not remained there\r\nforever. The true interests of Great Britain and her plantation are\r\nmutual, and what God in his providence has united, let no man dare\r\nattempt to pull asunder.\"\r\n\r\nIn June, 1763, a confederation, including several Indian tribes,\r\nsuddenly and unexpectedly swept over the whole western frontier of\r\nPennsylvania and Virginia. They murdered almost all the English settlers\r\nwho were scattered beyond the mountains, surprised every British fort\r\nbetween the Ohio and Lake Erie, and closely blockaded Forts Detroit and\r\nPitt. In no previous war had the Indians shown such skill, tenacity, and\r\nconcert, and had there not been British troops in the country the whole\r\nof Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Maryland would have been overrun.\r\n\r\nThe war lasted fourteen months, and most of the hard fighting was done\r\nby English troops, assisted by militia from some of the Southern\r\ncolonies. General Amherst called upon the New England colonies to help\r\ntheir brethren, but his request was almost disregarded. Connecticut sent\r\n250 men, but Massachusetts, being beyond the zone of immediate danger,\r\nwould give no assistance. After a war of extreme horror, peace was\r\nsigned September, 1764. In a large degree by the efforts of English\r\nsoldiers Indian territory was rolled back, and one more great service\r\nwas rendered by England to her colonies, and also the necessity was\r\nshown for a standing army.[6]\r\n\r\n  [6] Trumbull's \"His. of the U. S.,\" 445-467. Hildreth, Graham,\r\n  Hutchinson.\r\n\r\nThe \"French and Indian War,\" as it was commonly called, waged with so\r\nmuch energy and success, doubled the national debt of England and made\r\ntaxation oppressive in that country. The war had been waged mainly for\r\nthe benefit of the colonists, and as it was necessary to maintain a\r\nstanding army to protect the conquered territory, it was considered but\r\nreasonable that part of the expense should be borne by the Americans.\r\nThis was especially so in view that the conquest of Canada had been a\r\nprime object of statesmen and leading citizens of the colonies for many\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIt has been said on good authority that Franklin brought about the\r\nexpedition against Canada that ended with Wolfe's victory on the Plains\r\nof Abraham. In all companies and on all occasions he had urged conquest\r\nof Canada as an object of the utmost importance. He said it would\r\ninflict a blow upon the French power in America from which it would\r\nnever recover, and would have lasting influence in advancing the\r\nprosperity of the British colonies. Franklin was one of the shrewdest\r\nstatesmen of the age. After egging England on to the capture of Canada\r\nfrom the French, and then removing the most dreaded enemy of the\r\ncolonies, he won the confidence of the court and people of France, and\r\nobtained their aid to deprive England of the best part of a continent.\r\nHe was genial, thrifty, and adroit, and his jocose wisdom was never more\r\ntersely expressed than when he advised the signers of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence to \"hang together or they would hang separately.\"\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the Peace of Paris in 1763, Great Britain had\r\nceased to be an insular kingdom, and had become a world-wide empire,\r\nconsisting of three grand divisions: the British Islands, India, and a\r\nlarge part of North America. In Ireland an army of ten or twelve\r\nthousand men were maintained by Irish resources, voted by an Irish\r\nParliament and available for the general defence of the empire. In India\r\na similar army was maintained by the despotic government of the East\r\nIndia Company. English statesmen believed that each of these great parts\r\nof the empire should contribute to the defence of the whole, and that\r\nunless they should do so voluntarily it was their opinion, in which the\r\ngreat lawyers of England agreed, that power to force contributions\r\nresided in the Imperial Parliament at Westminster, and should be\r\nexercised. It was thought that an army of ten thousand men was necessary\r\nto protect the territory won from France and to keep the several tribes\r\nof American Indians in subjection, especially as it was believed that\r\nthe French would endeavor to recapture Canada at the first opportunity.\r\n\r\nAmericans, it should be remembered, paid no part of the interest on the\r\nnational debt of England, amounting to one hundred and forty million\r\npounds, one-half of which had been contracted in the French and Indian\r\nwar. America paid nothing to support the navy that protected its coasts,\r\nalthough the American colonies were the most prosperous and lightly\r\ntaxed portion of the British Empire. Grenville, Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, asked the Americans to contribute one hundred thousand pounds\r\na year, about one-third of the expense of maintaining the proposed army,\r\nand about one-third of one percent of the sum we now pay each year for\r\npensions. He promised distinctly that the army should never be required\r\nto serve except in America and the West India islands, but he could not\r\npersuade the colonists to agree among themselves on a practical plan for\r\nraising the money, and so it was proposed to resort to taxation by act\r\nof Parliament. At the time he made this proposal he assured the\r\nAmericans that the proceeds of the tax should be expended solely in\r\nAmerica, and that if they would raise the money among themselves in\r\ntheir own way he would be satisfied. He gave them a year to consider the\r\nproposition. At the end of the year they were as reluctant as ever to\r\ntax themselves for their own defence or submit to taxation by act of\r\nParliament. Then the stamp act was passed--it was designed to raise one\r\nhundred thousand pounds a year, and then the trouble began that led to\r\nthe dismemberment of the empire. Several acute observers had already\r\npredicted that the triumph of England over France would be soon followed\r\nby a revolt of the colonies. Kalm, the Swedish traveller, contended in\r\n1748 that the presence of the French in Canada, by making the English\r\ncolonists depend for their security on the support of the mother\r\ncountry, was the main cause of the submission of the colonies. A few\r\nyears later Argenson, who had left some of the most striking political\r\npredictions upon record, foretold in his Memoirs that the English\r\ncolonies in America would one day rise against the mother country, that\r\nthey would form themselves into a republic and astonish the world by\r\ntheir prosperity. The French ministers consoled themselves for the Peace\r\nof Paris by the reflection that the loss of Canada was a sure prelude to\r\nthe independence of the colonies, and Vergennes, the sagacious French\r\nambassador at Constantinople, predicted to an English traveller, with\r\nstriking accuracy, the events that would occur. \"England,\" he said,\r\n\"will soon repent having removed the only check that would keep her\r\ncolonies in awe. They stand no longer in need of her protection; she\r\nwill call upon them to contribute towards supporting the burden they\r\nhave helped to bring on her, and they will answer by striking off all\r\ndependence.\"[7]\r\n\r\n  [7] Bancroft's His. of the U.S., Vol. I., 525.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that Englishmen were wholly blind to this\r\ndanger. One of the ablest advocates of the retention of Canada was Lord\r\nBath, who published a pamphlet on the subject, which had a very wide\r\ninfluence and a large circulation.[8] There were, however, some\r\npoliticians who maintained that it would be wiser to restore Canada and\r\nto retain Guadaloupe, St. Lucia, and Martinique. This view was supported\r\nwith distinguished talent in an anonymous reply to Lord Bath.\r\n\r\n  [8] \"Letters to Two Great Men on the Prospect of Peace.\"\r\n\r\nThis writer argued \"that we had no original right to Canada, and that\r\nthe acquisition of a vast, barren, and almost uninhabited country lying\r\nin an inhospitable climate, and with no commerce except that of furs and\r\nskins, was economically far less valuable to England than the\r\nacquisition of Guadaloupe, which was one of the most important of the\r\nsugar islands. The acquisition of these islands would give England the\r\ncontrol of the West Indies, and it was urged that an island colony is\r\nmore advantageous than a continental one, for it is necessarily more\r\ndependent upon the mother country. In the New England provinces there\r\nare already colleges and academies where the American youths can\r\nreceive their education. America produces or can easily produce almost\r\neverything she wants. Her population and her wealth are rapidly\r\nincreasing, and as the colonies recede more and more from the sea, the\r\nnecessity of their connection with England will steadily diminish. They\r\nwill have nothing to expect, they must live wholly by their own labor,\r\nand in process of time will know little, inquire little, and care\r\nlittle, about the mother country. If the people of our colonies find no\r\ncheck from Canada they will extend themselves almost without bounds into\r\ninland parts. What the consequences will be to have a numerous, hardy,\r\nindependent people, possessed of a strong country, communicating little,\r\nor not at all, with England, I leave to your own reflections. By eagerly\r\ngrasping at extensive territory we may run the risk, and that, perhaps,\r\nin no distant period, of losing what we now possess. The possession of\r\nCanada, far from being necessary to our safety, may in its consequences\r\nbe even dangerous. A neighbor that keeps us in some awe is not always\r\nthe worst of neighbors; there is a balance of power in America as well\r\nas in Europe.\"[9]\r\n\r\n  [9] Remarks on the Letter Addressed to Two Great Men. Pp. 30-31.\r\n\r\nThese views are said to have been countenanced by Lord Hardwicke, but\r\nthe tide of opinion ran strongly in the opposite direction; the nations\r\nhad learned to look with pride and sympathy upon that greater England\r\nwhich was growing up beyond the Atlantic, and there was a desire, which\r\nwas not ungenerous or ignoble, to remove at any risk the one obstacle to\r\nits future happiness. These arguments were supported by Franklin, who in\r\na remarkable pamphlet sketched the great undeveloped capabilities of the\r\ncolonies, and ridiculed the \"visionary fear\" that they would ever\r\ncombine against England. \"This jealousy of each other,\" he said, \"is so\r\ngreat that, however necessary a union of the colonies has long been for\r\ntheir common defence and security against their enemies, yet they have\r\nnever been able to effect such a union among themselves. If they cannot\r\nagree to unite for defence against the French and Indians, can it\r\nreasonably be supposed there is any danger of their uniting against\r\ntheir own nation, which protects and encourages them, with which they\r\nhave so many connections and ties of blood, interest, and affection, and\r\nwhich it is well known, they all love _much more than they love one\r\nanother_.\"[10]\r\n\r\n  [10] Canada Pamphlet, Franklin's Works, IV., 41-42.\r\n\r\nWithin a few years after Franklin made this statement he did more than\r\nany other man living to carry into effect the \"visionary fear\" which he\r\nhad ridiculed.\r\n\r\nThe denial that independence was the object sought for was constant and\r\ngeneral. To obtain concessions and to preserve connection with the\r\nempire was affirmed everywhere. John Adams, the successor of Washington\r\nto the presidency, years after the peace of 1783 went farther than this,\r\nfor he said, \"There was not a moment during the Revolution when I would\r\nnot have given everything I possessed for a restoration to the state of\r\nthings before the contest began, provided we could have had a sufficient\r\nsecurity for its continuance.\"\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1774, Franklin assured Chatham that there was no desire\r\namong the colonists for independence. He said: \"Having more than once\r\ntravelled almost from one end of the continent to the other, and kept a\r\nvariety of company, eating and conversing with them freely, I have never\r\nheard in any conversation from any person, drunk or sober, the least\r\nwish for a separation or a hint that such a thing would be advantageous\r\nto America.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jay is quite as explicit: \"During the course of my life,\" said he,\r\n\"and until the second petition of Congress in 1775, I never did hear an\r\nAmerican of any class or of any description express a wish for the\r\nindependence of the colonies.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson affirmed: \"What eastward of New York might have been the\r\ndisposition towards England before the commencement of hostilities I\r\nknow not, but before that I never heard a whisper of a disposition to\r\nseparate from Great Britain, and after that its possibility was\r\ncontemplated with affliction by all.\"\r\n\r\nWashington in 1774 fully sustains their declarations, and in the\r\n\"Fairfax County Resolves\" it was complained that \"malevolent falsehoods\"\r\nwere propagated by the ministry to prejudice the mind of the king,\r\nparticularly that there is an intention in the American colonies to set\r\nup for independent state.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison says: \"It has always been my impression that a\r\nre-establishment of the colonial relations to the mother country, as\r\nthey were previous to the controversy, was the real object of every\r\nclass of the people till they despaired of obtaining redress for their\r\ngrievances.\"\r\n\r\nThis feeling among the revolutionists is corroborated by DuPortail, a\r\nsecret agent of the French government. In a letter dated 1778 he says:\r\n\"There is a hundred times more enthusiasm for the revolution in a\r\ncoffee-house at Paris than in all the colonies united. This people,\r\nthough at war with the English, hate the French more than they hate\r\nthem; we prove this every day, and notwithstanding everything that\r\nFrance has done or can do for them, they will prefer a reconciliation\r\nwith their ancient brethren. If they must needs be dependent, they had\r\nrather be so on England.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, as late as March, 1775, only a month before the outbreak of\r\nhostilities at Lexington, John Adams wrote: \"That there are any that\r\nhunt after independence is the greatest slander on the Province.\"\r\n\r\nThis feeling must have arisen from gratitude for the protection afforded\r\nby the mother country, or at least satisfaction with the relations then\r\nexisting. It is true, as has been shown in a previous chapter, that for\r\nsome years before the English Revolution, and for some years after the\r\naccession of William and Mary, the relations of the colonies to England\r\nhad been extremely tense, but in the long period of unbroken Whig rule\r\nwhich followed, most of the elements of discontent had subsided. The\r\nwise neglect of Walpole and Newcastle was eminently conducive to\r\ncolonial interests. The substitution in several colonies of royal for\r\nproprietary government was very popular. There were slight differences\r\nin the colonial forms of government, but everywhere the colonists paid\r\ntheir governor and their other officials. In nearly every respect they\r\ngoverned themselves, under the shadow of British dominion, with a\r\nliberty not equalled in any other portion of the civilized globe; real\r\nconstitutional liberty was flourishing in the English colonies when all\r\nEuropean countries and their colonies were despotically governed. The\r\ncircumstances and traditions of the colonists had made them extremely\r\nimpatient of every kind of authority, but there is no reason for\r\ndoubting that they were animated by a real attachment to England. Their\r\ncommercial intercourse, under the restructions of the navigation laws,\r\nwas mainly with her. Their institutions, their culture, their religion,\r\ntheir ideas were derived from English sources. They had a direct\r\ninterest in the English war against France and Spain. They were proud of\r\ntheir English lineage, of English growth in greatness, and of English\r\nliberty. On this point there is a striking answer made by Franklin in\r\nhis crafty examinations before the House of Commons in February, 1766.\r\nIn reply to the question, \"What was the temper of America towards Great\r\nBritain before the year 1763?\" he said, \"The best in the world. They\r\nsubmitted willingly to the government of the crown, and paid their\r\ncourts obedience to the Acts of Parliament. Numerous as the people are\r\nin the several old provinces, they cost you nothing in forts, citadels,\r\ngarrisons, or armies to keep them in subjection, they were governed by\r\nthis country at the expense only of a little pen, ink, and paper; they\r\nwere led by a thread. They had not only a respect, but an affection for\r\nGreat Britain, for its laws, its customs, and manners, and even a\r\nfondness for its fashions that greatly increased the commerce. Natives\r\nof Britain were always treated with particular regard; to be an 'Old\r\nEngland' man was of itself a character of some respect and gave a kind\r\nof rank among us.\" In reply to the question, \"What is their temper now?\"\r\nhe said, \"Very much altered.\" It is interesting to inquire what happened\r\nduring the three years intervening to change the temper of the\r\ncolonists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n_CAUSES THAT LED TO THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the principal causes that led to the American Revolution was the\r\nquestion of what was lawful under the constitution of the British\r\nempire, and what was expedient under the existing circumstances of the\r\ncolonies. It was the contention of the American Whigs that the British\r\nparliament could not lawfully tax the colonies, because by so doing it\r\nwould be violating an ancient maxim of the British constitution: \"No\r\ntaxation without representation.\"\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, many of the profoundest constitutional lawyers of\r\nAmerica as well as of England, both rejected the foregoing contention,\r\nand at the same time admitted the soundness and the force of the\r\nvenerable maxim upon which the contention was alleged to rest, but the\r\nmost of them denied that the maxim was violated by the acts of\r\nparliament laying taxation upon the colonies. Here everything depends on\r\nthe meaning to be attached to the word \"representation\"--and that\r\nmeaning is to be ascertained by examining what was understood by the\r\nword in England at the time when this old maxim originated, and in\r\nsubsequent ages during which it had been quoted and applied. During this\r\nwhole period the idea was that representation in parliament was\r\nconstituted not through any uniform distribution among individual\r\npersons, but rather through a distribution of such privileges among\r\ncertain organized communities, as counties, cities, boroughs, and\r\nuniversities. Very few people in England then had votes for members of\r\nthe house of commons--only one-tenth of the population of the entire\r\nrealm. Such was the state of the electoral system that entire\r\ncommunities, such as the cities of Leeds, Halifax, Birmingham,\r\nManchester, and Liverpool, communities which were as populous and as\r\nrich as entire provinces in America, and yet they had no vote whatever\r\nfor members of parliament. The people of these several communities in\r\nEngland did not refuse to pay taxes levied by act of parliament, because\r\nof that reason. It is still a principle of parliamentary representation\r\nthat from the moment a member is thus chosen to sit in parliament, he is\r\nthe representative of the whole empire, and not of his particular\r\nconstituency. He \"is under no obligation, therefore, to follow\r\ninstructions from the voters or the inhabitants of the district from\r\nwhich he is chosen. They have no legal means of enforcing instructions.\r\nThey cannot demand his resignation. Moreover, members of the house of\r\nlords represent, in principle, the interest of the whole empire and of\r\nall classes, as truly as the Commons.\"[11] Therefore the historic\r\nmeaning of the word \"representation,\" as the word has always been used\r\nin English constitutional experience, seemed to justify the Loyalist\r\ncontention that the several organized British communities in America, as\r\nan integral part of the British empire, were to all intents and purposes\r\nrepresented in the British parliament, which sat at the capital as the\r\nsupreme council of the whole empire and exercised legislative authority\r\ncoextensive with the boundaries of that empire. The Loyalists admitted\r\nthat for all communities of British subjects, both in England and\r\nAmerica, the existing representation was very imperfect; that it should\r\nbe reformed and made larger and more uniform, and they were ready and\r\nanxious to join in all forms of constitutional agitation under the\r\nleadership of such men as Chatham, Camden, Burke, Barre, Fox and Pitt,\r\nto secure such reform, and not for a rejection of the authority of the\r\ngeneral government, nullification, and disruption of the empire.\r\nAccordingly, when certain English commoners in America at last rose up\r\nand put forward the claim that merely because they had no votes for\r\nmembers of the house of commons, therefore that house did not represent\r\nthem, and therefore they could not lawfully be taxed by parliament, this\r\ndefinition of the word \"representation\" up to that time had never been\r\ngiven to it in England or enjoyed by commoners in England. Nine-tenths\r\nof the people of England did not vote. Had not those British subjects in\r\nEngland as good a right as these British subjects in America to deny\r\nthey were represented in parliament, and that they could not be lawfully\r\ntaxed by parliament? It was the right and duty of the imperial\r\nlegislature to determine in what proportion the different parts of the\r\nempire should contribute to the defence of the whole, and to see that no\r\none part evaded its obligation and unjustly transferred its part to\r\nothers. The right of taxation was established by a long series of legal\r\nauthorities, and there was no real distinction between internal and\r\nexternal taxation. It now suited colonists to describe themselves as\r\napostles of liberty and to denounce England as an oppressor. It was a\r\nsimple truth that England governed her colonies more liberally than any\r\nother country in the world. They were the only existing colonies which\r\nenjoyed real political liberty. Their commercial system was more liberal\r\nthan that of any other colony. They had attained under British rule to a\r\ndegree of prosperity which was surpassed in no quarter of the globe.\r\nEngland had loaded herself with debt in order to remove one great danger\r\nto their future; she cheerfully bore the whole burden of their\r\nprotection by sea. At the Peace of Paris she had made their interests\r\nthe very first object of her policy, and she only asked them in return\r\nto bear a portion of the cost of their own defence. Less than eight\r\nmillions of Englishmen were burdened with a national debt of 140,000,000\r\npounds. The united debt of about three millions of Americans was now\r\nless than 800,000 pounds. The annual sum the colonists were asked to\r\ncontribute was less than 100,000, with an express condition that no part\r\nof that sum should be devoted to any other purpose than the defence and\r\nprotection of the colonies, and the country which refused to bear this\r\nsmall tax was so rich that in the space of three years it had paid off\r\n1,755,000 pounds of its debt. No demand could be more moderate and\r\nequitable than that of England. The true motive of the resistance was a\r\ndesire to pay as little as possible and to throw as much as possible\r\nupon the mother country. Nor was the mode of resistance more\r\nhonorable--the plunder of private houses, and custom-houses, and mob\r\nviolence, connived at and unpunished. This was the attitude of the\r\ncolonies within two years after the Peace of Paris, and these were the\r\nfruits of the new sense of security which British triumphs in Canada had\r\ngiven to the colonists.\r\n\r\n  [11] John W. Burgess, \"Political Science and Comparative Constitutional\r\n  Law,\" 67-68, also 65-69.\r\n\r\nThis is a brief statement and a fair one of the principal arguments of\r\nthe Loyalists. Certainly the position taken by them was a very strong\r\none. A learned American writer upon law, one of the justices of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, in referring to the decision of\r\nChief Justice Hutchinson sustaining the legality of the writs of\r\nassistance, gave this opinion: \"A careful examination of the question\r\ncompels the conclusion that there was at least reasonable ground for\r\nholding, as a matter of mere law, that the British parliament had power\r\nto bind the colonies.\"[12] This view has been sustained by the highest\r\nEnglish authorities upon British constitutional law, from the time of\r\nLord Mansfield to the present. \"As a matter of abstract right,\" says Sir\r\nVernon Harcourt, \"the mother country has never parted with the claim of\r\nultimate supreme authority for the imperial legislature. If it did so,\r\nit would dissolve the imperial tie, and convert the colonies into\r\nforeign and independent states.\" It is now apparent that those Americans\r\nwho failed in their honest and sacrificial championship of measures that\r\nwould have given us political reform and political safety, but without\r\ncivil war, and without an angry disruption of the English-speaking race\r\ncan justly be regarded as having been, either in doctrine or in purpose,\r\nor in act, an unpatriotic party, and yet even at the present time it is\r\nby no means easy for Americans, if they be descended from men who fought\r\nin behalf of the Revolution, to take a disinterested attitude, that is\r\nan historical one towards those Americans who thought and fought against\r\nthe Revolution.\r\n\r\n  [12] Horace Gray, Quincy's Mass. Reports, 1761-62, Appendix I., page\r\n  540.\r\n\r\nNo candid historian, however, now contends that the government of\r\nEngland had done anything prior to the commencement of the Revolutionary\r\nWar that justified a Declaration of Independence; for, as previously\r\nstated, the amount of taxes required by Parliament was moderate, the\r\nmoney was needed for a proper purpose, and it seemed there was no other\r\nway of obtaining it.\r\n\r\nAnother important factor in the causes of the American Revolution was\r\nthe so-called \"Quebec Act.\" This act John Adams asserted constituted a\r\n\"frightful system,\" and James Rowdoin pronounced it to be \"an act for\r\nencouraging and establishing Popery.\" The policy of this legislation may\r\nbe doubted. Of its justice there can be no doubt. The establishment of\r\nthe Catholic clergy in Canada and their resultant domination has\r\nentailed many disadvantages upon the governing powers of the dominion.\r\nBut at the time the law was passed it was a simple act of justice. Had\r\nParliament refused to do this it would have been guilty of that tyranny\r\ncharged against it by the Revolutionists, and today the dominion would\r\nnot be a part of the British Empire. To the student of American history\r\nit at first seems very strange and unaccountable why at the outbreak of\r\nthe Revolution, the recently conquered French provinces were not the\r\nfirst to fly to arms, especially as their mother country, France, had\r\nespoused the cause of the Revolutionists. Instead of this the French\r\nCanadians remained loyal to their conqueror and resisted by force of\r\narms all attempts to conquer Canada. The explanation of this curious\r\nstate of affairs is the \"Quebec Act.\"\r\n\r\nBy this act the French Canadians were to retain their property, their\r\nlanguage, their religion, their laws, and to hold office. In fact, they\r\nwere allowed greater liberty than they had when subject to France. All\r\nthis was allowed them by the British Parliament, and this was resented\r\nby the English colonists, for they were not allowed to confiscate their\r\nlands and drive out the inhabitants as the New Englanders did when they\r\nconquered Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island. They\r\nalso claimed that by the laws of the realm Roman Catholics could not\r\nvote, much less hold office. At a meeting of the first Continental\r\nCongress, held October 21, 1774, an address to the people of Great\r\nBritain was adopted, setting forth the grievances of the colonies, the\r\nprincipal one of which was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Nor can we suppress our astonishment that a British Parliament should\r\never consent to establish in that country a religion that has deluged\r\nyour island in blood and dispersed impiety, bigotry, persecution, murder\r\nand rebellion through every part of the world, and we think the\r\nlegislature of Great Britain is not authorized to establish a religion\r\nfraught with such sanguinary and infamous tenets.\"\r\n\r\nThis act also granted the Catholic clergy a full parliamentary title to\r\ntheir old ecclesiastical estates, and to tithes paid by members of their\r\nown religion, but no Protestant was obliged to pay tithes. It provided\r\nfor a provincial governing council in which Catholics were eligible to\r\nsit, and it established the Catholic clergy securely in their livings.\r\nThere were then in the Province of Quebec two hundred and fifty\r\nCatholics to one Protestant[13]. Surely it would have been a monstrous\r\nperversion of justice to have placed this vast majority under the\r\ndomination of this petty minority, it would have degraded the Catholics\r\ninto a servile caste and reproduced in America, in a greatly aggravated\r\nform, the social conditions which existed in Ireland, but those\r\ndetermined sticklers for freedom of conscience and \"the right of\r\nself-government,\" those clamorers for the liberty of mankind, the\r\ndisunion propagandists, were horrified at the bestowal of any \"freedom\"\r\nor \"right\" upon a people professing a religion different from their\r\nown. \"The friends of America\" in England, Chatham, Fox, Burke, Barre and\r\nothers, joined them in their denunciation of the act, the last named\r\nespecially deprecating the \"Popish\" measure.\r\n\r\n  [13] In the debates on the Canadian bill in 1779, it was stated that\r\n  there were but 365 Protestants and 150,000 Catholics within the Province\r\n  of Quebec.\r\n\r\nOn February 15, 1776, it was resolved that a committee of three, \"two of\r\nwhom should be members of congress,\" be appointed to pursue such\r\ninstructions as shall be given them by that body.[14] Benjamin Franklin,\r\nSamuel Chase and Chas. Carroll were chosen for this purpose, and John\r\nCarroll, a Jesuit, who afterwards became the first Roman Catholic\r\nArchbishop of the United States, accompanied them. The two Carrolls were\r\nchosen because they were Catholics, but they were not justified in\r\njoining an expedition that might kindle the flame of religious war on\r\nthe Catholic frontier. The commissioners carried with them an \"Address\r\nto the Inhabitants of the Province of Quebec\"[15] from Congress, which\r\nfor cool audacity and impertinence can scarcely be paralleled. It\r\ncommenced with \"We are too well acquainted with the liberality of\r\nsentiment distinguishing your natures to imagine that difference of\r\nreligion will prejudice you against a hearty amity with us,\" etc.\r\n\r\n  [14] Washington's Writings, Vol. III., page 361.\r\n\r\n  [15] Debates, etc., page 603.\r\n\r\nThe address from the Continental Congress was translated into French and\r\nwas very favorably received. They then begged the translator, as he had\r\nsucceeded so well, to try his hand on that addressed to Great Britain.\r\nHe had equal success in this, and read his performance to a numerous\r\naudience. But when he came to that part which treats of the new\r\nmodelling of the province, draws a picture of the Catholic religion and\r\nCanadian manners, they could not restrain their resentment nor express\r\nit except in broken curses. \"O the perfidious, double-faced Congress!\r\nLet us bless and obey our benevolent prince, whose humanity is\r\nconsistent and extends to all religions. Let us abhor all who would\r\nseduce us from our loyalty by acts that would dishonor a Jesuit, and\r\nwhose address, like their resolves, is destructive of their own\r\nobjects.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the commissioners were applying themselves with the civil\r\nauthorities, Rev. Mr. Carroll was diligently employed with the clergy,\r\nexplaining to them that the resistance of the united colonies was caused\r\nby the invasion of their charter by England. To this the clergy replied\r\nthat since the acquisition of Canada by the British government its\r\ninhabitants had no aggression to complain of, that on the contrary the\r\ngovernment had faithfully complied with all the stipulations of the\r\ntreaty, and had in fact sanctioned and protected the laws and customs of\r\nCanada with a delicacy that demanded their respect and gratitude, and\r\nthat on the score of religious liberty the British government had left\r\nthem nothing to complain of.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore that when the well-established principle that allegiance\r\nis due to protection, the clergy could not teach that even neutrality\r\nwas consistent with the allegiance due to such ample protection as\r\nGreat Britain had shown the Catholics of Canada. The judicious and\r\nliberal policy of the British government to the Catholics had succeeded\r\nin inspiring them with sentiments of loyalty which the conduct of the\r\npeople and the public bodies of some of the united colonies had served\r\nto strengthen and confirm. Mr. Carroll was also informed that in the\r\ncolonies whose liberality he was now avouching, the Catholic religion\r\nhad not been tolerated hitherto. Priests were excluded under severe\r\npenalties and Catholic missionaries among the Indians rudely and cruelly\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams, who was a member of the congress that sent the commissioners\r\nto Canada, in a letter to his wife, did not state the true reason for\r\nsending a Jesuit priest there, and also warned her against divulging the\r\nfact that a priest had been sent, for fear of offending his\r\nconstituents[16]\r\n\r\nHe wrote as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. John Carroll of Maryland, a Roman Catholic priest and a Jesuit, is\r\nto go with the committee, the priests of Canada having refused baptism\r\nand absolution to our friends there. Your prudence will direct you to\r\ncommunicate the circumstances of the priest, the Jesuit, and the Romish\r\nreligion, only to such persons as can judge of the measure upon large\r\nand generous principles, and will not indiscreetly divulge it.\"[16]\r\n\r\n  [16] Letter of John Adams to his wife, Vol. I., page 86.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams also wrote: \"We have a few rascally Jacobites and Roman\r\nCatholics in this town (Braintree), but they do not dare to show\r\nthemselves.\"[17]\r\n\r\n  [17] Life and Works of John Adams, Vol. IX., page 335.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KILLING AND SCALPING OF FATHER RASLE AT NORRIDGEWOCK\r\n\r\nBy Massachusetts scalp hunters, L100 bounty was offered for the scalp of\r\na male Indian, and L50 for that of women or children.]\r\n\r\nTo any statesman who looked into the question inquiringly and with clear\r\nvision, it must have appeared evident that, if the English colonies\r\nresolved to sever themselves from the British Empire, it would be\r\nimpossible to prevent them. Their population was said to have doubled in\r\ntwenty-five years. They were separated from the mother country by three\r\nthousand miles of water, their seaboard extended for more than one\r\nthousand miles, their territory was almost boundless in its extent and\r\nresources, and the greater part of it no white man had traversed or\r\nseen. To conquer such a country would be a task of greatest difficulty\r\nand stupendous cost. To hold it in opposition to the general wish of the\r\npeople would be impossible. The colonists were chiefly small and\r\nindependent freeholders, hardy backwoodsmen and hunters, well skilled in\r\nthe use of arms and possessed of all the resources and energies which\r\nlife in a new country seldom fails to develop. They had representative\r\nassemblies to levy taxes and organize resistance. They had militia,\r\nwhich in some colonies included all adult freemen between the ages of\r\nsixteen and fifty or sixty, and, in addition to Indian raids, they had\r\nthe military experience of two great wars. The first capture of\r\nLouisburg, in 1745, had been mainly their work. In the latter stages of\r\nthe war, which ended in 1763, there were more than twenty thousand\r\ncolonial troops under arms, ten thousand of them from New England alone,\r\nand more than four hundred privateers had been fitted out in colonial\r\nharbors.[18]\r\n\r\n  [18] Ramsey, History of the American Revolution, Vol. I, page 40;\r\n  Hildreth, Vol. II., page 486; Grahame, Vol. IV., page 94.\r\n\r\nThere were assuredly no other colonies in the world so favorably\r\nsituated as these were at the close of the Seven Years' War. They had\r\nbut one grievance, the Navigation Act, and it is a gross and flagrant\r\nmisrepresentation to describe the commercial policy of England as\r\nexceptionally tyrannical. As Adam Smith truly said, \"Every European\r\nnation had more or less taken to itself the commerce of its colonies,\r\nand upon that account had prohibited the ships of foreign nations from\r\ntrading with them, and had prohibited them from importing European goods\r\nfrom any foreign nation,\" and \"though the policy of Great Britain with\r\nregard to the trade of her colonies has been dictated by the same\r\nmercantile spirit as that of other nations, it has, upon the whole, been\r\nless illiberal and oppressive than any of them.\"[19]\r\n\r\n  [19] Wealth of Nations, Vol. IV., chapter 7; Tucker's Four Tracts, page\r\n  133.\r\n\r\nThere is, no doubt, much to be said in palliation of the conduct of\r\nEngland. If Virginia was prohibited from sending her tobacco to any\r\nEuropean country except England, Englishmen were prohibited from\r\npurchasing any tobacco except that which came from America or Bermuda.\r\nIf many of the trades and manufactures in which the colonies were\r\nnaturally most fitted to excel were restrained or crushed by law,\r\nEnglish bounties encouraged the cultivation of indigo and the\r\nexportation to England of pitch, tar, hemp, flax and ship timber from\r\nAmerica, and several articles of American produce obtained a virtual\r\nmonopoly of the English market by their exemption from duties which were\r\nimposed on similar articles imported from foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThe revenue laws were habitually violated. Smuggling was very lucrative,\r\nand therefore very popular, and any attempt to interfere with it was\r\ngreatly resented. The attention of the British government was urgently\r\ncalled to it during the war. At a time when Great Britain was straining\r\nevery nerve to free the English colonies from the incubus of France, and\r\nwhen millions of pounds sterling were being remitted from England to pay\r\ncolonists for fighting in their own cause, it was found that French\r\nfleets, French garrisons, and the French West India Islands were\r\nsystematically supplied with large quantities of provisions by the New\r\nEngland colonies. Pitt, who still directed affairs, wrote with great\r\nindignation that this contraband trade must be stopped, but the whole\r\ncommunity of the New England seaports appeared to favor or was partaking\r\nin it, and great difficulty was found in putting the law into\r\nexecution.[20]\r\n\r\n  [20] Hildreth Vol. II., page 498; McPherson's Annals of Commerce, Vol.\r\n  III., page 330; Arnold's History of Rhode Island, Vol. II., pages\r\n  227-235.\r\n\r\nFrom a legal point of view, the immense activity of New England was for\r\nthe most part illicit. In serene ignorance the New England sailor\r\npenetrated all harbors, conveying in their holds, from the North, where\r\nthey belonged, various sorts of interdicted merchandise, and bringing\r\nhome cargoes equally interdicted from all ports they touched. The\r\nmerchants, who since 1749, through Hutchinson's excellent statesmanship,\r\nhad been free from the results of a bad currency, greatly throve. The\r\nshipyards teemed with fleets, each nook of the coast was the seat of\r\nmercantile ventures. It was then that in all the shore towns arose the\r\nfine colonial mansions of the traders along the main streets, that are\r\neven admired today for their size and comeliness. Within the houses\r\nbric-a-brac from every clime came to abound, and the merchants and their\r\nwives and children were clothed gaily in rich fabrics from remote\r\nregions. Glowing reports of the gaiety and luxury of the colonies\r\nreached the mother country.[21] The merchants and sailors were, to a\r\nman, law-breakers. It was this universal law-breaking, after the fall of\r\nQuebec, that the English ministry undertook to stop over its extended\r\nempire. This caused friction, which gave rise to fire, which increased\r\nuntil the ties with the mother land were quite consumed.\r\n\r\n  [21] Gordon's History of the American War, Vol. I., page 157.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1762 there were loud complaints in Parliament of the\r\nadministration of custom houses in the colonies. Grenville found on\r\nexamination that the whole revenue derived by England from the custom\r\nhouses in America amounted only to between one and two thousand pounds a\r\nyear, and that for the purpose of collecting this revenue the English\r\nexchequer was paying annually between seven and eight thousand pounds.\r\nNine-tenths, probably, of all the tea, wine, fruit, sugar and molasses\r\nconsumed in the colonies, were smuggled. Grenville determined to\r\nterminate this state of affairs. Several new revenue officers were\r\nappointed with more rigid rules for the discharge of their duties.\r\n\"Writs of assistance\" were to be issued, authorizing custom house\r\nofficers to search any house they pleased for smuggled goods. English\r\nships of war were at the same time stationed off the American coast for\r\nthe purpose of intercepting smugglers.\r\n\r\nAdam Smith, writing in 1776, says:\r\n\r\n\"Parliament, in attempting to exercise its supposed right, whether well\r\nor ill-grounded, of taxing the colonies, _has never hitherto demanded of\r\nthem anything which even approached to a just proportion to what was\r\npaid by their fellow subjects at home_. Great Britain has hitherto\r\nsuffered her subjects and subordinate provinces to disburden themselves\r\nupon her of almost the whole expense.\"\r\n\r\nThe colonists had profited by the successful war incomparably more than\r\nany other British subjects. Until the destruction of the French power, a\r\nhand armed with a rifle or tomahawk and torch seemed constantly near the\r\nthreshold of every New England home. The threatening hand was now\r\nparalyzed and the fringe of plantations by the coast could now extend\r\nitself to the illimitable West in safety. No foreign foe could now\r\ndictate a boundary line and bar the road beyond it. The colonists were\r\nasked only to bear a share in the burden of the empire by a\r\ncontribution to the sum required for maintenance of the ten thousand\r\nsoldiers and of the armed fleet which was unquestionably necessary for\r\nthe protection of their long coast line and of their commerce.\r\n\r\nJames Otis started the Revolution in New England by what Mr. Lecky calls\r\nan \"incendiary speech\" against writs of assistance, and if half of what\r\nHildreth asserts and Bancroft admits in regard to smuggling along the\r\ncoast of New England is true, there is no reason to wonder that such\r\nwrits were unpopular in Boston. James Otis, whose father had just been\r\ndisappointed in his hopes of obtaining a seat upon the bench, was no\r\ndoubt an eloquent man and all the more dangerous because he often\r\nthought he was right. That it is always prudent to distrust the\r\neloquence of a criminal lawyer we have ample proof, in the advice he\r\ngave the people on the passage of the Stamp Act. \"It is the duty,\" he\r\nsaid, \"of all, humbly and silently to acquiesce in all the decisions of\r\nthe supreme legislature. Nine hundred and ninety-nine in a thousand of\r\nthe colonists will never once entertain a thought but of submission to\r\nour sovereign and to authority of Parliament, in all possible\r\ncontingencies. They undoubtedly have the right to levy internal taxes on\r\nthe colonies.\"\r\n\r\nIn private talk he was more vigorous than in his formal utterance.\r\n\"Hallowell says that Otis told him Parliament had a right to tax the\r\ncolonies and he was a d---- fool who denied it, and that this people\r\nwould never be quiet till we had a council from home, till our charter\r\nwas taken away and till we had regular troops quartered upon us.\"[22]\r\n\r\n  [22] John Adams' Diary, January 16, 1776.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams wrote in his diary, under date of January 16, 1770,\r\nconcerning Otis, as follows: \"In one word Otis will spoil the club. He\r\ntalks so much and takes up so much of our time and fills it with trash,\r\nobsceneness, profaneness, nonsense and distraction that we have none\r\nleft for rational amusements or inquiries. I fear, I tremble, I mourn\r\nfor the man and for his country. Many others mourn over him with tears\r\nin their eyes.\"\r\n\r\nAgain John Adams says, after an attack upon him by Otis: \"There is a\r\ncomplication of malice, envy and jealousy in the man, in the present\r\ndisordered state of his mind, that is quite shocking.\"[23] On the 7th of\r\nMay, 1771, Otis, who at this time had recovered his reason was elected\r\nwith John Hancock to the assembly. They both left their party and went\r\nover to the side of the government. John Adams wrote \"Otis' change was\r\nindeed startling. John Chandler, Esq., of Petersham gave me an account\r\nof Otis' conversion to Toryism, etc.\" Hutchinson writing to Governor\r\nBernard, says, \"Otis was carried off today in a post-chaise, bound hand\r\nand foot. He has been as good as his word--set the Province in a flame\r\nand perished in the attempt.\"\r\n\r\n  [23] John Adams' Diary, October 27, 1772; John Adams' Works, Vol. II\r\n  page 26; Letters to Bernard December 3, 1771.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia the revolutionary movement of the poor whites or\r\n\"crackers,\" led by Patrick Henry, was against the planter aristocracy,\r\nand Washington was a conspicuous member of the latter class. In tastes,\r\nmanners, instincts and sympathies he might have been taken as an\r\nadmirable specimen of the better class of English country gentlemen, and\r\nhe had a great deal of the strong conservative feeling which is natural\r\nto that class. He was in the highest sense a gentleman and a man of\r\nhonor, and he carried into public life the severest standard of private\r\nmorals.\r\n\r\nIt was only slowly and very deliberately that Washington identified\r\nhimself with the disunionist cause. No man had a deeper admiration for\r\nthe British constitution, or a more sincere desire to preserve the\r\nconnection, and to put an end to the disputes between the two countries.\r\nFrom the first promulgation of the Stamp Act, however, he adopted the\r\nconviction that a recognition of the sole right of the colonies to tax\r\nthemselves was essential to their freedom, and as soon as it became\r\nevident that Parliament was resolved at all hazards to assert its\r\nauthority by taxing the Americans, he no longer hesitated. Of all the\r\ngreat men in history he was the most invariably judicious, and there is\r\nscarcely a rash word or action of judgment related of him. America had\r\nfound in Washington a leader who could be induced by no earthly motive\r\nto tell a falsehood or to break an engagement or to commit a\r\ndishonorable act.\r\n\r\nIn the despondency of long-continued failure, in the elation of sudden\r\nsuccess, at times when his soldiers were deserting by hundreds, and when\r\nmalignant plots were formed against his reputation; amid the constant\r\nquarrels, rivalries and jealousies of his subordinates; in the dark hour\r\nof national ingratitude and in the midst of the most universal and\r\nintoxicating flattery, he was always the same calm, wise, just and\r\nsingle-minded man, pursuing the course which he believed to be right,\r\nwithout fear, favor or fanaticism.\r\n\r\nIn civil as in military life he was pre-eminent among his contemporaries\r\nfor the clearness and soundness of his judgment, for his perfect\r\nmoderation and self-control, for the quiet dignity and the indomitable\r\nfirmness with which he pursued every path which he had deliberately\r\nchosen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: READING THE STAMP ACT IN KING STREET: OPPOSITE THE STATE\r\nHOUSE.]\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, the heart of the Old Dominion was fired by Patrick\r\nHenry, one of the most unreliable men living. Byron called him a\r\nforest-born Demosthenes, and Jefferson, wondering over his career,\r\nexclaimed: \"Where he got that torrent of language is inconceivable. I\r\nhave frequently closed my eyes while he spoke and, when he was done,\r\nasked myself what he had said without being able to recollect a word of\r\nit.\" He had been successively a storekeeper, a farmer and a shopkeeper,\r\nbut had failed in all these pursuits and became a bankrupt at\r\ntwenty-three. Then he studied law a few weeks and practiced a few years.\r\nThe first success he made in this line was in an effort to persuade a\r\njury to render one of the most unjust verdicts ever recorded in\r\ncourt. Finally he embarked on the stormy sea of politics. One day he\r\nworked himself into a fine frenzy, and in a most dramatic manner\r\ndemanded \"Liberty or Death,\" although he had both freely at his\r\ndisposal. He was a slaveholder nearly all his life. He bequeathed slaves\r\nand cattle in his will, and one of his eulogists brags that he would buy\r\nor sell a horse or a negro as well as anybody.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams of Braintree, now Quincy, was a graduate of Harvard College,\r\nand a lawyer by profession. He ranks next to Washington as being the\r\nmost prominent of the Revolutionary leaders. He was the son of a poor\r\nfarmer and shoemaker. He married Abigail Smith, the daughter of the\r\nCongregational minister in the adjoining town of Weymouth. Much\r\ndisapprobation of the match appears to have been manifested, for Mr.\r\nAdams, the son of a poor farmer, was thought scarcely good enough to be\r\nmatch with the minister's daughter, descended from many of the shining\r\nlights of the colony.[24]\r\n\r\n  [24] \"Letters of Mrs. Adams.\" Memoirs, XXIX.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams was a cousin of Samuel Adams. He joined the disunionists,\r\nprobably, because he saw that if the Revolution was successful there\r\nwould be great opportunity for advancement under the new government.\r\nThis proved to be the case, for he was the first minister to Great\r\nBritain, the successor of Washington as second president of the United\r\nStates. His eldest son became the sixth president, and his grandson,\r\nCharles Francis Adams, ably represented his country as minister to Great\r\nBritain during the Civil War of 1861.\r\n\r\nThe Stamp Act received the royal assent on March 22, 1765, and it was to\r\ncome into operation on the first day of November following. The\r\n\"Virginia Resolutions,\" through which Patrick Henry first acquired a\r\ncontinental fame, voted by the House of Burgess in May following, denied\r\nvery definitely the authority of Parliament to tax the colonies. At\r\nfirst men recoiled. Otis was reported to have publicly condemned them in\r\nKing street, which was no doubt true, for, as we have seen, he fully\r\nadmitted the supremacy of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe principal objection made by the colonists to the Stamp Act was that\r\nit was an internal tax. They denied the right of Parliament to impose\r\ninternal taxation, claiming that to be a function that could be\r\nexercised only by colonial assemblies. They admitted, however, that\r\nParliament had a right to levy duties on exports and imports, and they\r\nhad submitted to such taxation for many years without complaint.\r\n\r\nIn order to soften the opposition, and to consult to the utmost of his\r\npower the wishes of the colonists, Grenville informed the colonial\r\nagents that the distribution of the stamps should be confided not to\r\nEnglishmen but to Americans. Franklin, then agent for Pennsylvania,\r\naccepted the act and, in his canny way, took steps to have a friend\r\nappointed stamp distributor for his province. This made him very\r\nunpopular and the mob threatened to destroy his house.\r\n\r\nThe Stamp Act, when its ultimate consequences are considered, must be\r\ndeemed one of the most momentous legislative acts in the history of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nA timely concession of a few seats in the upper and lower houses of the\r\nImperial Parliament would have set at rest the whole dispute. Franklin\r\nhad suggested it ten years before, anticipating even Otis, Grenville was\r\nquite ready to favor it, Adam Smith advocated it. Why did the scheme\r\nfail? Just at that time in Massachusetts a man was rising into\r\nprovincial note, who was soon to develop a heat, truly fanatical, in\r\nfavor of an idea quite inconsistent with Franklin's plan. He from the\r\nfirst claimed that representation of the colonies in Parliament was\r\nquite impracticable or, if accepted, would be of no benefit to the\r\ncolonies, and that there was no fit state for them but independence. His\r\nvoice at first was but a solitary cry in the midst of a tempest, but it\r\nprevailed mightily in the end.\r\n\r\nThis sole expounder of independence was Samuel Adams, the father of the\r\nRevolution. Already his influence was superseding that of Otis, in\r\nstealthy ways of which neither Otis nor those who made an idol of him\r\nwere sensible, putting into the minds of men, in the place of the ideas\r\nfor which Otis stood, radical conceptions which were to change in due\r\ntime the whole future of the world. \"Samuel Adams at this time was a man\r\nof forty-two years of age, but already gray and bent with a physical\r\ninfirmity which kept his head and hands shaking like those of a\r\nparalytic. He was a man of broken fortunes, a ne'er-do-well in his\r\nprivate business, a failure as a tax collector, the only public office\r\nhe had thus far undertaken to discharge.\"[25] He had an hereditary\r\nantipathy to the British government, for his father was one of the\r\nprincipal men connected with Land-Bank delusion, and was ruined by the\r\nrestrictions which Parliament imposed on the circulation of paper money,\r\ncausing the closing up of the bank by act of Parliament and leaving\r\ndebts which seventeen years later were still unpaid.\r\n\r\n  [25] Hosmer, Life of Hutchinson, page 82.\r\n\r\nIt appears that Governor Hutchinson was a leading person in dissolving\r\nthe bank, and from that time Adams was the bitter enemy of Hutchinson\r\nand the government. Hutchinson in describing him says, \"Mr. S. Adams had\r\nbeen one of the directors of the land bank in 1741 which was dissolved\r\nby act of Parliament. After his decease his estate was put up for sale\r\nby public auction, under authority of an act of the General Assembly.\r\nThe son first made himself conspicuous on this occasion. He attended the\r\nsale, threatened the sheriff to bring action against him and threatened\r\nall who should attempt to enter upon the estate under pretence of a\r\npurchase, and by intimidating both the sheriff and those persons who\r\nintended to purchase, he prevented the sale, kept the estate in his\r\npossession and the debts to the land bank remained unsatisfied. He was\r\nafterwards a collector of taxes for the town of Boston and made\r\ndefalcation which caused an additional tax upon the inhabitants. He was\r\nfor nearly twenty years a writer against government in the public\r\nnewspapers. Long practice caused him to arrive at great perfection and\r\nto acquire a talent of artfully and fallaciously insinuating into the\r\nminds of readers a prejudice against the characters of all he attacked\r\nbeyond any other man I ever knew, and he made more converts to his cause\r\nby calumniating governors and other servants of the crown than by\r\nstrength of reasoning. The benefit to the town from his defence of their\r\nliberties, he supposed an equivalent to his arrears as their collector,\r\nand prevailing principle of the party that the end justified the means\r\nprobably quieted the remorse he must have felt from robbing men of their\r\ncharacters and injuring them more than if he had robbed them of their\r\nestates.\"[26]\r\n\r\n  [26] Hutchinson's History, Vol. III., pages 294-295.\r\n\r\nIn a letter written by Hutchinson about this time he thus characterizes\r\nhis chief adversary:\r\n\r\n\"I doubt whether there is a greater incendiary in the King's dominion or\r\na man of greater malignity of heart, who has less scruples any measure\r\never so criminal to accomplish his purposes; and I think I do him no\r\ninjustice when I suppose he wishes the destruction of every friend to\r\ngovernment in America.\"[27]\r\n\r\n  [27] M. A. History, Vol. XXV., page 437.\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated March 13, 1769, Adams petitioned the town, requesting\r\nthat he be discharged from his indebtedness to the town for the amount\r\nthat he was in arrears as tax collector. He states that the town\r\ntreasurer, by order of the town, had put his bond in suit and recovered\r\njudgment for the sum due L2009.8.8. He stated that his debts and\r\nL1106.11 will fully complete the sum which he owes and requests \"that\r\nthe town would order him a final discharge upon the condition of his\r\npaying the aforesaid sum of L1106.11 into the province treasury.\" This\r\nletter of Adams to the town of Boston fully confirms the statement made\r\nby Hutchinson that he was a defaulter, for it appears from this letter\r\nthat during the several years he was collector of taxes for the town,\r\nthat he did not make a proper return for the taxes which he had\r\ncollected, and it was only after suit and judgment had been obtained\r\nagainst his bondsmen that restitution was made, his sureties having to\r\npay over $5000 in cash and the balance was made up of uncollected\r\ntaxes.[28]\r\n\r\n  [28] This letter was purchased at the E. H. Leffingwell sale of January\r\n  6, 1891, for $185, by the city of Boston, and can be seen at the city\r\n  clerk's office. In connection with this see \"Life of Samuel Adams,\" by\r\n  his great-grandson, William V. Wells, Vol. I., pages 35-38. Here he\r\n  emphatically denies that bonds or sureties were given by collectors.\r\n  Evidently he had not consulted Boston Town Records, 1767, page 9, when\r\n  it was voted that Samuel Adams' bond \"shall be put in Suit,\" and when\r\n  bonds and sureties were required of his successor, neither could he have\r\n  known of the existence of this letter.\r\n\r\nAdams was poor, simple, ostentatiously austere; the blended influence of\r\nCalvinistic theology and republican principles had indurated his whole\r\ncharacter. He hated monarchy and the Episcopal church, all privileged\r\nclasses and all who were invested with dignity and rank, with a fierce\r\nhatred. He was the first to foresee and to desire an armed struggle, and\r\nhe now maintained openly that any British troops which landed should be\r\ntreated as enemies, attacked and if possible destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n_BOSTON MOBS AND THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE REVOLUTION._\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the adoption in Massachusetts of Patrick Henry's resolves, the\r\npeople, brooding over the injuries which Adams made them believe they\r\nwere receiving under the Stamp Act, became fiercer in temper. Open\r\ntreason was talked, and many of the addresses to the Governor, composed\r\nby Adams, were models of grave and studied insolence. The rough\r\npopulation which abounded about the wharves and shipyards grew riotous,\r\nand, with the usual indiscrimination of mobs, was not slow to lift its\r\nhands against even the best friends of the people. \"Mob law is a crime,\r\nand those who engage in mobs are criminals.\" This is a fundamental axiom\r\nof orderly government that cannot be denied.\r\n\r\nThe first great riot was in anticipation of the arrival of the stamps.\r\nOn the morning of August 14, 1765, there appeared, at what is now a\r\ncorner of Washington and Essex streets, two effigies, hanging on an elm\r\ntree, representing Andrew Oliver, the stamp agent, and Lord Bute, the\r\nformer prime minister. In the evening these images were carried as far\r\nas Kilby street, where there was a new unfinished government building,\r\nwrongly supposed to have been erected for use as a stamp office. This\r\nthe mob completely demolished, and, taking portions of its wood-work\r\nwith them, they proceeded to Fort Hill, where a bonfire was made in\r\nfront of the house of Mr. Oliver, burning the effigy of Lord Bute there,\r\nand committing gross outrages on Oliver's premises, which were plundered\r\nand wrecked.\r\n\r\nA few nights later riots recommenced with redoubled fury, the rioters\r\nturning their attention to the house of Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson,\r\nwho was also chief justice, and kinsman of Oliver. Hutchinson was not\r\nonly the second person in rank in the colony, but was also a man who had\r\npersonal claims of the highest kind upon his countrymen. He was an\r\nAmerican, a member of one of the oldest colonial families, and, in a\r\ncountry where literary enterprise was very uncommon, he had devoted a\r\ngreat part of his life to investigating the history of his native\r\nprovince. His rare abilities, his stainless private character, and his\r\ngreat charm of manner, were universally recognized. He had at one time\r\nbeen one of the most popular men in the colony, and although Hutchinson\r\nwas opposed to the Stamp Act, the determined impartiality with which, as\r\nChief Justice, he upheld the law, soon made him obnoxious to the mob.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANDREW OLIVER, STAMP COLLECTOR ATTACKED BY THE MOB.\r\n\r\nHis beautiful mansion on Oliver street, Fort Hill, was wrecked and he\r\nnarrowly escaped with his life.]\r\n\r\nWhen the mob surrounded his house in Garden Court street, they called\r\nfor him to appear on his balcony, to give an account of himself as to\r\nthe Stamp Act. He barred the doors and windows and remained within. One\r\nof his neighbors, alarmed, no doubt, as to the safety of his own\r\nproperty, told the mob that he had seen Hutchinson drive out just at\r\nnightfall, and that he had gone to spend the night at his country house\r\nat Milton. On hearing this the mob dispersed, having done no other\r\ndamage than the breaking of windows.\r\n\r\nThe popular fury had now become so ungovernable and perilous that\r\nGovernor Bernard took refuge in the Castle, leaving Hutchinson to bear\r\nthe brunt of this vehement hostility. Shortly after the governor's\r\nretreat, on the 26th of August, occurred a riot as disgraceful as any on\r\nrecord on either side of the Atlantic. It commenced at dusk with a\r\nbonfire on King street. One of the fire-wards attempted to extinguish\r\nit, but he was driven from the ground by a heavy blow from one of the\r\nmob which had assembled. The fire was doubtless kindled as a signal for\r\nthe assembling of a ruffianly body of disguised men, armed with clubs\r\nand staves. They first went to the house of the register of the\r\nadmiralty court, broke into his office in the lower story, and fed the\r\nfire hard by with the public archives in his keeping, and with all his\r\nown private papers. Next they went to the house of the comptroller of\r\ncustoms in Hanover street, tore down his fence, broke his windows,\r\ndemolished his furniture, stole his money, scattered his papers, and\r\navailed themselves of the wine in his cellar as a potent stimulant to\r\ngreater excesses.\r\n\r\nThey then proceeded to Hutchinson's house, the finest and most costly in\r\nBoston. He had barely time to escape with his family, otherwise murder\r\nwould no doubt have put a climax to the criminal orgies of the night.\r\nThe rioters hewed down the doors with broad axes, destroyed or stole\r\neverything of value, including important historical data which he had\r\nspent years in collecting, papers which, if preserved to his countrymen,\r\nwould be worth many times their weight in gold; and still further\r\nmaddened by the contents of the cellar, the incendiary crowd broke up\r\nthe roof and commenced tearing down the wood-work of the mansion.\r\n\r\nThere exists competent evidence that the municipal authorities had\r\ntimely notice of the pendency of this riot. They held a town meeting\r\nnext day, denounced the rioters by unanimous vote, in which many who had\r\nbeen foremost in the affair gave assent to their own condemnation, but\r\nnothing was done towards punishing the perpetrators of the outrages, and\r\nit was evident that the prevailing feeling was with the rioters. Those\r\nwho were arrested and committed for trial were released by a formidable\r\nbody of sympathizers, undoubtedly fellow criminals, who went by night to\r\nthe jail, forced the jailer to deliver up the keys, and released the\r\nculprits.\r\n\r\nThe Custom House was selected for assault and pillage on the following\r\nnight. The collector somehow gained information of this purpose. He had\r\nin his custody about four thousand pounds in specie, which could not be\r\nremoved so secretly as to elude the espionage of eyes intent on rapine\r\nand plunder. The governor, at the urgent demand of the collector,\r\ncalled out the cadets, who constituted his special guard. The mob\r\nassembled. The commanding officers addressed them, first with\r\npersuasion, then with threats, but in vain. Driven to extremity he\r\nordered his company to prime and load, and then begged the rioters to\r\nretire. They remained immovable until the order was given to \"aim,\" when\r\na hurried retreat of the tumultuous rabble ensued.\r\n\r\nThere were, subsequently, various public demonstrations of a disorderly\r\ncharacter; effigies of unpopular members of the home and provincial\r\ngovernments were hanged and burned, and there were frequent displays of\r\nviolent hostility to the administration; but it was not till June, 1768,\r\nthat there was another dangerous and destructive riot. In this there\r\ncannot be the slightest doubt that the mob had on their side as little\r\nmoral justification as legal right. The sloop \"Liberty,\" belonging to\r\nJohn Hancock, a leading merchant of the patriot party, arrived at\r\nBoston, laden with wine from Madeira, and a custom-house officer went on\r\nboard to inspect the cargo. He was seized by the crew and detained for\r\nseveral hours, while the cargo was landed, and a few pipes of wine were\r\nentered on oath at the Custom House as if they had been the whole. On\r\nthe liberation of the customs' officers the vessel was seized for a\r\nfalse entry, and in order to prevent the possibility of a rescue it was\r\nremoved from the wharf to the protection of the guns of a man of war. A\r\nmob was speedily collected, and as the rabble could not get possession\r\nof the sloop, they attacked the revenue officers for doing their duty in\r\nproperly seizing the vessel for false entry and smuggling. The\r\ncollector, his son, and two inspectors, received the most barbarous\r\ntreatment, were badly bruised and wounded, and hardly escaped with their\r\nlives. The mob next went to the house of the inspector-general, and to\r\nthat of the comptroller of customs, and broke their windows. They then\r\ndragged the collector's boat to the Common and burned it there.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the lawless condition of Boston, there cannot be any\r\nquestion that Governor Bernard was fully authorized to seek the presence\r\nof troops. The crown officers were in a rightful possession of their\r\noffices, and it would have been cowardly for them to desert their posts\r\nand sail for England, and thus to leave anarchy behind them. Meanwhile\r\ntheir lives were in peril, and they had an unquestionable right to\r\ndemand competent protection. This they could have only by sending out of\r\nthe province for it. The colonial militia could not be relied upon, for\r\nthe mob must have been largely represented in its ranks. Nor could\r\ndependence be placed on the cadets, for Hancock, in whose behalf the\r\nlast great riot had been perpetrated, was an officer of that corps. The\r\nonly recourse was to the importation of royal troops--a measure which\r\nlegal modes of remonstrance by patriots worthy of the name would never\r\nhave rendered necessary or justifiable.\r\n\r\nTwo regiments, the 14th and 29th, of about five hundred men each,\r\narrived on Sept. 28, 1768. These soldiers were, of course, a burden and\r\nannoyance. They could not have been otherwise. Individually they were\r\nnot gentlemen, and they could not have been expected to be so. Yet had\r\ntheir presence been desired or welcome, there is no reason to suppose\r\nthat there would have been any unpleasant collision with them.\r\n\r\nThe first token of resentment on the part of the populace occurred\r\neleven days after their arrival. The colonel of one of the regiments had\r\nordered a guard-house to be built on the Neck. The site was visited in\r\nthe night by a mob, who tore down the frame of the building and cut it\r\nin pieces, so that no part of it could be put to further use. From that\r\ntime on there were perpetual quarrels and brisk interchanges of\r\ncontumely, abuse, and insult between the soldiers and the inhabitants,\r\nin which gangs of ropemakers bore a prominent part. There was\r\nundoubtedly no lack of ill-blood on either side, but, after patiently\r\nreading the contemporary record of what took place, we are inclined to\r\nadopt the statement of Samuel G. Drake, whose intense loyalty as a\r\nloving citizen of Boston no one can question, and who writes \"That\r\noutrages were committed by the soldiers is no doubt true; but these\r\noutrages were exaggerated, and they probably, in nine cases out of ten,\r\nwere the abused party.\"[29]\r\n\r\n  [29] \"History of Boston,\" Samuel T. Drake, page 778.\r\n\r\nPassing over intervening dissensions and tumults, we now come to the\r\nso-called \"Boston Massacre,\" on the 5th of March, 1770, an occasion on\r\nwhich loss of life was inevitable, and the only question was whether it\r\nshould be among the soldiers or their assailants. The riot was evidently\r\npredetermined, as one of the bells was rung about eight o'clock, and\r\nimmediately afterwards bands of men, with clubs, appeared upon the\r\nstreets. Early in the evening there had been some interchange of\r\nhostilities, chiefly verbal, between the soldiers and town people, but\r\nan officer had ordered his men into the barrack-yard, and closed the\r\ngate. The \"main guard,\" for that day's duty, was from the 29th regiment.\r\n\r\nAbout nine o'clock a solitary sentinel in front of the custom-house on\r\nKing street, now known as State street, was assailed by a party of men\r\nand boys, who pelted him with lumps of ice and coal, and threatened him\r\nwith their clubs. Being forbidden by the rules of the service to quit\r\nhis post, he called upon the \"main guard,\" whose station was within\r\nhearing. A corporal and seven soldiers were sent to his relief. They\r\nwere followed by Captain Preston, who said, \"I will go there myself to\r\nsee that they do no mischief.\" By that time the crowd had become a large\r\none, intensely angry, and determined on violence. The mob supposed the\r\nsoldiers were helpless and harmless; that they were not permitted to\r\nfire unless ordered by a magistrate. The rioters repeatedly challenged\r\nthe soldiers to fire if they dared, and the torrent of coarse and\r\nprofane abuse poured upon the soldiers is astonishing even in its echoes\r\nacross the century, and would furnish material for an appropriate\r\ninscription on the Attucks monument. The soldiers stood on the defensive\r\nwhile their lives were endangered by missiles, and till the crowd closed\r\nupon them in a hand-to-hand conflict. The leader of the assault was\r\n\"Crispus Attucks,\" a half Indian and half negro, who raised the\r\nblood-curdling war-whoop, the only legacy save his Indian surname and\r\nhis strength and ferocity, that he is known to have received from his\r\nsavage ancestry. He knocked down one of the soldiers, got possession of\r\nhis musket, and would, no doubt, have killed him instantly had not the\r\nsoldiers fired at that moment and killed Attucks and two other men, two\r\nmore being fatally wounded. There is no evidence that Captain Preston\r\nordered the firing, though if he did he certainly deserved no blame, as\r\nthe shooting was, for the soldiers, the only means of defence. There is\r\nno doubt that the mobs on these occasions were set in movement and\r\ndirected by some persons of higher rank and larger views of mischief\r\nthan themselves.\r\n\r\nGordon, the historian of the American Revolution, informs us that the\r\nmob was addressed, in the street, before the firing, by a tall, large\r\nman, in a red cloak and white wig, and after listening to what he had to\r\noffer in the space of three or four minutes, they huzza for the \"main\r\nguard\" and say, \"We will do for the soldiers.\" He also said, \"But from\r\nthe character, principles, and policies of certain persons among the\r\nleaders of the opposition, it may be feared that they had no objection\r\nto a recounter that by occasioning the death of a few might eventually\r\nclear the place of the two regiments.\"\r\n\r\nThis avowal, which, coming from such a source, has all the weight of\r\npremeditation, chills us with its deliberate candor, and begets\r\nreflections on the desperate means resorted to by some of the leaders of\r\nthe populace in those trying times, which historians generally have\r\nshrunk from suggesting.\r\n\r\nHutchinson fulfilled at this time, with complete adequacy, the functions\r\nof chief magistrate. He was at once in the street in imminent danger of\r\nhaving his brains dashed out,[30] expostulating, entreating, that order\r\nmight be observed. His prompt arrest of Preston and the squad which had\r\ndone the killing was his full duty, and it is to the credit of the\r\ntroops that the officer and his men, in the midst of the exasperation,\r\ngave themselves quietly into the hands of the law.\r\n\r\n  [30] \"Life of Thomas Hutchinson,\" page 162.\r\n\r\nIn the famous scenes which followed, the next day, Samuel Adams and\r\nother leading agitators, as representatives of the people, rushed into\r\nthe presence of Hutchinson, and rather commanded than asked for the\r\nremoval of the troops. Hutchinson hesitated. He was not yet\r\ngovernor--Bernard was in England. The embarrassment of the situation for\r\nthe chief magistrate was really appalling. He knew that their removal\r\nwould, under the circumstances, be a great humiliation to the government\r\nand a great encouragement to the mob. On the other hand, if the soldiers\r\nremained it was only too probable that in a few hours the streets of\r\nBoston would run with blood. He consulted the council, and found, as\r\nusual, an echo of the public voice. He then yielded, and the troops were\r\nsent to Fort William, on Castle Island, three miles from the town.\r\n\r\nAlthough, from that day to this, it has been held that the British\r\nuniform was driven with ignominy out of the streets of Boston, they\r\ndeserve no discredit for their submission to the Governor and his\r\ncouncil. They were two weak regiments, together amounting to not more\r\nthan eight hundred effective men, isolated in a populous province which\r\nhated them, and were in great peril of life. It does not appear that\r\nthey showed the white feather at all, but rather that they were\r\nlaw-abiding. Probably few organizations in the British army have a\r\nrecord more honorable. The 14th was with William III. in Flanders; it\r\nformed, too, one of the squares of Waterloo, breasting for hours the\r\ncharges of the French cuirassiers until it had nearly melted away. The\r\n29th was with Marlboro at Ramillies, and with Wellington in the\r\nPeninsula; it bore a heavy part, as may be read in Napier, in wresting\r\nSpain from the grasp of Napoleon. To fight it out with the mob would no\r\ndoubt have been far easier and pleasanter than to yield; for brave\r\nsoldiers to forbear is harder than to fight, and one may be sure that in\r\nthe long history of those regiments few experiences more trying came to\r\npass than those of the Boston streets.\r\n\r\nFew things contributed more to commence the American Revolution than\r\nthis unfortunate affray. Skillful agitators perceived the advantage it\r\ngave them, and the most fantastic exaggerations were dexterously\r\ndiffused. It, however, had a sequel which is extremely creditable to the\r\ncitizens of Boston.\r\n\r\nIt was determined to try the soldiers for their lives, and public\r\nfeeling ran so fiercely against them that it seemed as if their fate was\r\nsealed. The trial, however, was delayed for seven months till the\r\nexcitement had in some degree subsided. Captain Preston very judiciously\r\nappealed to John Adams, who was rapidly rising to the first place among\r\nthe lawyers and the popular party of Boston, to undertake his defence.\r\nAdams knew well how much he was risking by espousing so unpopular a\r\ncause, but he knew also his professional duty, and though violently\r\nopposed to the British Government, he was an eminently honest, brave,\r\nand humane man. In conjunction with Josiah Quincy, a young lawyer who\r\nwas also of the popular party, he undertook the invidious task, and he\r\ndischarged it with consummate ability. Three years afterwards he wrote\r\nin his diary: \"The part I took in defence of Capt. Preston and the\r\nsoldiers procured me anxiety and obloquy enough. It was, however, one of\r\nthe most gallant, generous, manly, and disinterested acts of my whole\r\nlife, and one of the best pieces of service I ever rendered my country.\r\nJudgment of death against those soldiers would have been as foul a stain\r\nupon this country as the execution of the Quakers or witches, anciently.\r\nAs the evidence was, the verdict of the jury was exactly right.\"\r\n\r\nThese noble words and his actions in this matter are sufficient alone to\r\nprove that John Adams was a fit successor to President Washington. He\r\nwas entirely just in the estimate he put upon his conduct in these frank\r\nterms. His defence of the soldiers was one of the most courageous acts\r\nthat a thoroughly manly man performed, and his summing up of the matter\r\njust quoted, is perfectly accurate. If John Adams showed himself here a\r\nman of sense and a hero, as much cannot be said of his cousin, Samuel\r\nAdams, who undoubtedly was one of the leaders who incited the mob to\r\nattack the soldiers, as hinted at by Gordon. And, again, in the\r\nvindictive persecution which followed, in the attempt to arouse in\r\nEngland and America indignation against the soldiers, by documents based\r\non evidence hastily collected in advance of the trial, from wholly\r\nunreliable witnesses, and in the attempt to precipitate the trial while\r\npassion was still hot, the misbehavior of the people was grave. In all\r\nthis no leader was more eager than Samuel Adams, and in no time in his\r\ncareer, probably, does he more plainly lay himself open to the charge of\r\nbeing a reckless demagogue, a mere mob-leader, than at this moment.\r\n\r\nCaptain Preston and six of the soldiers, who were tried for murder, were\r\nacquitted; two of the soldiers, convicted of manslaughter, were branded\r\non the hand and then released. The most important testimony in the case\r\nwas that of the celebrated surgeon, John Jeffries, who attended Patrick\r\nCarr, an Irishman, fatally wounded in the affray. It is as follows: \"He\r\nsaid he saw many things thrown at the sentry; he believed they were\r\noyster shells and ice; he heard the people huzza every time they heard\r\nanything strike that sounded hard. He then saw some soldiers going down\r\ntowards the custom-house; he saw the people pelt them as they went\r\nalong. I asked him whether he thought the soldiers would fire; he said\r\nhe thought the soldiers would have fired long before. I then asked him\r\nif he thought the soldiers were abused a great deal; he said he thought\r\nthey were. I asked him whether he thought the soldiers would have been\r\nhurt if they had not fired; he said he really thought they would, for he\r\nheard many voices cry out, 'Kill them!' I asked him, meaning to close\r\nall, whether he thought they fired in self-defence or on purpose to\r\ndestroy the people; he said he really thought they did fire to defend\r\nthemselves; that he did not blame the man, whoever he was, that shot\r\nhim. He told me he was a native of Ireland; that he had frequently seen\r\nmobs, and soldiers called to quell them. Whenever he mentioned that, he\r\ncalled himself a fool; that he might have known better; that he had seen\r\nsoldiers often fire on people in Ireland, but had never in his life seen\r\nthem bear so much before they fired.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Adams, in his plea in defence of the soldiers, said: \"We have been\r\nentertained with a great variety of phrases to avoid calling this sort\r\nof people a mob. Some called them shavers, some called them geniuses.\r\nThe plain English is, they were probably a motley rabble of saucy boys,\r\nnegroes, mulattoes, Irish teagues, and outlandish Jack-tars, and why we\r\nshould scruple to call such a set of people a mob, I can't conceive,\r\nunless the name is too respectable for them.\"\r\n\r\nChief-Justice Lynde, eminent for his judicial integrity and\r\nimpartiality, said on the announcement of the verdict: \"Happy am I to\r\nfind, after much strict examination, the conduct of the prisoners\r\nappears in so fair a light, yet I feel myself deeply affected that this\r\naffair turns out so much to the disgrace of every person concerned\r\nagainst them, and so much to the shame of the town in general.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1887, at the instigation of John Boyle O'Reilly and the negroes of\r\nBoston, the Legislature passed a bill authorizing the expenditure of\r\n$10,000 for the purpose of erecting a monument to the memory of the\r\n\"victims of the Boston Massacre.\" The monument was erected on Boston\r\nCommon, notwithstanding the fact that the Massachusetts Historical\r\nSociety, and the New England Historic Genealogical Society, voted\r\nunanimously against it. \"That it was a waste of public money, that the\r\naffray was occasioned by the brutal and revengeful attack of reckless\r\nroughs upon the soldiers, while on duty, who had not the civilian's\r\nprivilege of retreating, but were obliged to contend against great odds,\r\nand used their arms only in the last extremity; that the killed were\r\nrioters and not patriots, and that a jury of Boston citizens had\r\nacquitted the soldiers.\" A joint committee, composed of members of both\r\nsocieties, presented the resolutions to Governor Ames, and requested him\r\nto veto the bill. He admitted that \"the monument ought not to be\r\nerected, but if he vetoed the bill it would _cost the Republican party\r\nthe colored vote_.\" When the monument was erected and uncovered, it\r\npresented such an indecent appearance that the City Council immediately\r\nvoted $250 for a new capstone. It now represents an historical lie, and\r\nis a sad commentary on the intelligence and art taste of the citizens of\r\nBoston. To be sure monuments of stone will not avail to perpetuate an\r\nerror of history, as witness the monument erected to commemorate the\r\nGreat Fire of London. The inscription on that monument, embodying a\r\ngross perversion of history, was effaced in 1831, after it had stood\r\nthere one hundred and fifty years, but the just resentment, the\r\nill-feeling, the grief and shame which it engendered during that period,\r\nhad been evils of incalculable magnitude. The time will surely come when\r\nthe monument on Boston Common will be removed for the same reason.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of March, 1766, the Stamp Act was repealed. It had remained\r\nin force but one year, and was then repealed in an effort to pacify the\r\ncolonists. A duty was placed on tea and other imports which the\r\ncolonists had always admitted to be a valid act of the Parliament.\r\nWhatever might be said of the Stamp Act, the tea duty was certainly not\r\na real grievance to Americans, for Parliament had relieved the colonists\r\nof a duty of 12d. in the pound which had hitherto been levied in\r\nEngland, and the colonists were only asked, in compensation, to pay a\r\nduty of 3d. in the pound on arrival of the tea in America. The measure,\r\ntherefore, was not an act of oppression, but of relief, making the price\r\nof tea in the colonies positively cheaper by 9d. per pound than it had\r\nbeen before. But the turbulent spirits were not to be satisfied so\r\neasily. They organized an immense boycott against British goods and\r\ncommercial intercourse with England, and appointed vigilance committees\r\nin many communities to see that the boycott was rigidly enforced.\r\nHutchinson, in describing them, says: \"In this Province the faction is\r\nheaded by the lowest, dirtiest, and most abject part of the community,\r\nand so absurdly do the Council and House of Representatives reason, that\r\nthey justify this anarchy, the worst of tyranny, as necessary to remove\r\na single instance of what they call oppression; they have persecuted my\r\nsons with peculiar pleasure.\" August 26, 1770, he wrote to William\r\nParker, of Portsmouth: \"You certainly think right when you think Boston\r\npeople are run mad. The frenzy was not higher when they banished my\r\npious great-grandmother, when they hanged the Quakers, when they\r\nafterwards hanged the poor innocent witches, when they were carried away\r\nwith a Land Bank, or when they all turned \"New Lights,\" than the\r\npolitical frenzy has been for a twelve-month past.\"[31]\r\n\r\n  [31] \"Life of Hutchinson,\" page 195.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1773, three ships laden with tea, private property of an\r\ninnocent corporation, arrived at Boston, and on the 16th of that month,\r\nforty or fifty men, disguised as Mohawk Indians, under the direction of\r\nSamuel Adams, John Hancock, and others, boarded the vessels, posted\r\nsentinels to keep all agents of authority off at a distance, and flung\r\nthe three cargoes, consisting of three hundred and forty-two chests,\r\ninto the harbor. How can we, law-abiding citizens, applaud the \"Boston\r\nTea Party\" and condemn the high-handed conduct of strike-leaders of the\r\npresent time? In this transaction some respectable men were engaged, and\r\ntheir posterity affects to be proud of it. But they were not proud of it\r\nat the time. In their disguise as Indians they were not recognized, and\r\nthe few well-known names among them were not divulged till the rebellion\r\nbecame a successful revolution. It probably made no \"patriots.\" We have\r\nproof that it afterwards turned the scales against the patriot cause\r\nwith some who had sympathized with it and taken part in it.\r\n\r\nLooking back to those times during later years, John Adams wrote: \"The\r\npoor people themselves, who, by _secret manoeuvres_, _are excited to\r\ninsurrection_, are seldom aware of the purposes for which they are set\r\nin motion or of consequences which may happen to themselves; and _when\r\nonce heated and in full career_, _they can neither manage themselves nor\r\nbe managed by others_.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOSTONIANS PAYING THE EXCISEMAN, OR TARRING AND\r\nFEATHERING.\r\n\r\nA cartoon published in London in 1771, showing how the authority of the\r\ngovernment was wholly disregarded in Boston.]\r\n\r\nThe illegal seizure of the tea was in a certain sense parallel to the\r\nso-called \"respectable\" mob which on the 11th of August, 1834, destroyed\r\nthe Charlestown convent, and, a year later, nearly killed Garrison and\r\nmade the jail his only safe place of refuge. Had slavery triumphed, that\r\nmob would at this day be the object and the subject of popular\r\nglorification; every man who belonged to it, who was present abetting\r\nand encouraging it, would claim his share of the glory, and a roll of\r\nhonor would have been handed down for a centennial celebration in which\r\nevery slaveholder in the land would have borne a part. But now that\r\nslavery is dead, and the statue of Garrison has its place in the\r\nfashionable avenue of Boston, there is no longer any merit in the\r\nendeavor to buttress the fallen cause. Had the Revolution failed, the\r\ndisgrace of the men who threw the tea overboard would never have been\r\nremoved, and the best that history could say of them would be that, like\r\nthe Attucks mob, they were enthusiasts without reason.\r\n\r\nJohn Hancock, one of the principal leaders of the Tea Party Mob, and the\r\nowner of the sloop \"Liberty,\" which was seized for smuggling, and later\r\nthe first to sign the Declaration of Independence, inherited L70,000\r\nfrom his uncle, who had made a large part of it by importing from the\r\nDutch island of St. Eustacia great quantities of tea, in molasses\r\nhogsheads, and, by the importation of a few chests from England, had\r\nfreed the rest from suspicion, and not having been found out, had borne\r\nthe reputation of a \"fair trader.\" Partly by inattention to his private\r\naffairs, and partly from want of sound judgment, John Hancock became\r\ngreatly involved and distressed, and his estate was lost with much\r\ngreater rapidity than it had been acquired by his uncle.[32]\r\n\r\n  [32] His. Mass. Bay, page 207.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams had very positive opinions concerning the mobs of the\r\nRevolution. In a letter to his wife he says:\r\n\r\n\"I am engaged in a famous cause. The cause of King of Scarborough\r\n_versus_ a mob that broke into his house and rifled his papers and\r\nterrified him, his wife, children and servants, in the night. The terror\r\nand distress, the distraction and horror of this family, cannot be\r\ndescribed in words, or painted upon canvas. It is enough to move a\r\nstatue, to melt a heart of stone, to read the story. A mind susceptible\r\nof the feelings of humanity, a heart which can be touched with\r\nsensibility for human misery and wretchedness, must relent, must burn\r\nwith resentment and indignation at such outrageous injuries. These\r\nprivate mobs I do and will detest.\"[33]\r\n\r\n  [33] Letters of John Adams to his wife, Vol. I, pages 12-13.\r\n\r\nConcerning the Loyalists, he says: \"A notion prevails among all parties\r\nthat it is politest and genteelest to be on the side of the\r\nadministration, that the better sort, the wiser few, are on one side,\r\nand that the multitude, the vulgar, the herd, the rabble, the mob, only\r\nare on the other.\"[34]\r\n\r\n  [34] Letters of John Adams to his wife, Vol. I., page 12.\r\n\r\nAs regards his own actions towards the Loyalists, he writes in his later\r\nyears as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Nothing could be more false and injurious to me than the imputation of\r\nany sanguinary zeal against the Tories, for I can truly declare that\r\nthrough the whole Revolution, and from that time to this, I never\r\ncommitted one act of severity against the Tories.\"[35]\r\n\r\n  [35] Diary of John Adams, page 413.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the shedding of the first blood at Lexington, Hancock was\r\nrespondent, in the admiralty court, in suits of the crown to recover\r\nnearly half a million of dollars, as penalties alleged to have been\r\nincurred for violation of the statute-book. It was fit that he should\r\nbe the first to affix his name to an instrument which, if made good,\r\nwould save him from financial ruin.\r\n\r\nOne-fourth of the signers of the Declaration of Independence were bred\r\nto trade or to the command of ships, and more than one of them was\r\nbranded with the epithet of \"smuggler.\"[36]\r\n\r\n  [36] Sabine. Vol. I., page 13.\r\n\r\nIn 1773 John Hancock was elected treasurer of Harvard college. \"In this\r\nthey considered their patriotism more than their prudence.\" The amount\r\nof college funds paid over to him was upwards of fifteen thousand and\r\nfour hundred pounds, and, like his friend, Samuel Adams, he, too, proved\r\nto be a defaulter. For twenty years the corporation begged and entreated\r\nhim to make restitution. They threatened to prosecute him and also to\r\nput his bond in suit, as Adams' was, but it was all of no avail. He\r\nturned a deaf ear to their entreaties, and it was only after his death,\r\nin 1793, that his heirs made restitution to the college, when a\r\nsettlement was made, in 1795, in which the college lost five hundred and\r\ntwenty-six dollars interest.\r\n\r\nJosiah Quincy, the president of Harvard college, in referring to this\r\nmatter, says:\r\n\r\n\"From respect to the high rank which John Hancock attained among the\r\npatriots of the American Revolution, it would have been grateful to pass\r\nover in silence the extraordinary course he pursued in his official\r\nrelation to Harvard college, had truth and the fidelity of history\r\npermitted. But justice to a public institution which he essentially\r\nembarrassed during a period of nearly twenty years, and also to the\r\nmemory of those whom he made to feel and to suffer, requires that these\r\nrecords of unquestionable facts which at the time they occurred were the\r\ncause of calumny and censure to honorable men, actuated in this measure\r\nsolely by a sense of official fidelity, should not be omitted. In\r\nrepublics, popularity is the form of power most apt to corrupt its\r\npossessor and to tempt him, for party or personal interests, to trample\r\non right to set principle at defiance. History has no higher or more\r\nimperative duty to perform than, by an unyielding fidelity, to impress\r\nthis class of men with the apprehension that although through fear or\r\nfavor they may escape animadversion of contemporaries, there awaits them\r\nin her impartial record, the retribution of truth.\"[37]\r\n\r\n  [37] \"History of Harvard University,\" by Josiah Quincy, Vol. II., pp.\r\n  182-209.\r\n\r\nThe action of the tea mob was the culmination of mob violence in Boston.\r\nIt brought the king and parliament to decide that their rebellious\r\nsubjects in Boston must be subdued by force of arms, and that mob\r\nviolence should cease. General Thomas Gage was to have at his command\r\nfour regiments and a powerful fleet. He arrived at Boston, May 13, 1774,\r\nand was appointed to supersede Governor Thomas Hutchinson, as governor,\r\nwho had succeeded Governor Sir Francis Bernard in 1771. General Gage was\r\nnow in the prime of life. He had served with great credit under several\r\ncommanders, at Fontenoy and Culloden, and had fought with Washington,\r\nunder Braddock, at Monongahela, where he was severely wounded, and\r\ncarried a musket ball in his side for the remainder of his life as a\r\nmemento of that fatal battle. An intimacy then existed between him and\r\nWashington, which was maintained afterwards by a friendly\r\ncorrespondence, and which twenty years later ended regretfully when they\r\nappeared, opposed to each other, at the head of contending armies, the\r\none obeying the commands of his sovereign and the other upholding the\r\ncause of his people. How many cases similar to this occurred, eighty-six\r\nyears later, when brother officers in arms faced each other with hostile\r\nforces, and friendship and brotherly love were changed to deadly hatred.\r\n\r\nThe claim has been set up by American historians, and accepted as true\r\nby those of Great Britain, that hostilities were commenced at Lexington\r\nand by the British commander. This is not so. The first act of\r\nhostilities was the attack upon the government post of Fort William and\r\nMary at Newcastle, in Portsmouth harbor, New Hampshire. The attack was\r\ndeliberately planned by the disunion leaders, and executed by armed and\r\ndisciplined forces mustered by them for that purpose.[38] The fort\r\ncontained large quantities of government arms and ammunition, and being\r\ngarrisoned by but a corporal's guard, it was too tempting a prize to be\r\noverlooked by Samuel Adams and his colleagues.\r\n\r\nSir John Wentworth, governor of New Hampshire, tells us that the raiding\r\nparty was openly collected by beat of drum in the streets of Portsmouth,\r\nand that, being apprised of their intent to attack a government fort, he\r\nsent the chief justice to warn them that such an act \"was short of\r\nrebellion,\" and entreated them not to undertake it, \"but all to no\r\npurpose.\" They embarked in three boats, sailed to the fortress and\r\n\"forced an entrance in spite of Captain Cochrane, the commander, who\r\ndefended it as long as he could. They then secured the captain\r\ntriumphantly, gave three cheers, and hauled down the king's colors.\"[38]\r\n\r\n  [38] Letter of Governor Wentworth, New Eng. His. Gen. Reg., 1869, page\r\n  274.\r\n\r\nThomas Coffin Amory, in his \"Military Service of General Sullivan,\" says\r\n(p. 295) that \"the raiding force consisted of men whom Sullivan had been\r\ndrilling for several months; that they captured 97 kegs of powder and a\r\nquantity of small ammunition which were used against the British at\r\nBunker Hill.\"\r\n\r\nThe attack on this fort is worthy of far more consideration than has\r\nbeen given to it, for not only did it occur prior to the conflict at\r\nConcord, but was the direct cause of that conflict. It was as much the\r\ncommencement of the Revolutionary war as was the attack on Fort Sumpter\r\nby the disunionists, in 1861, the commencement of the Civil War, and had\r\nprecisely the same effect in each case. When the news reached London\r\nthat a government fort had been stormed by an organized force, its\r\ngarrison made prisoners and the flag of the empire torn down, the\r\nministers seem to have become convinced that it was the determination of\r\nthe colonists to make war upon the government. To tolerate such a\r\nproceeding would be a confession that all law and authority was at an\r\nend. Some vindication of that authority must be attempted. An order was\r\ndispatched to General Gage to retake the munitions that had been seized\r\nby the disunion forces, and any other found stored that might be used\r\nfor attacking the government troops; surely a very mild measure of\r\nreprisal. It was in obedience to this order that the expedition was\r\ndispatched to Concord, that brought about the collision between the\r\nBritish and colonial troops and the so-called \"Battle of Lexingon.\"\r\n\r\nIn Rhode Island, a revenue outrage of more than common importance\r\noccurred at this time. A small schooner named the Gaspee, in the\r\ngovernment service, with a crew of some 25 sailors, commanded by\r\nLieutenant Duddingston, while pursuing a suspected smuggler on June 6,\r\n1772, ran aground on a sand-bar near Providence, and the ship which had\r\nescaped brought the news to that town. Soon after a drum was beat\r\nthrough the streets, and all persons who were disposed to assist in the\r\ndestruction of the king's ship were summoned to meet at the home of a\r\nprominent citizen. There appears to have been no concealment or\r\ndisguise, and shortly after 10 at night eight boats, full of armed men,\r\nstarted with muffled oars on the expedition. They reached the stranded\r\nvessel in the deep darkness of the early morning. Twice the sentinel on\r\nboard vainly hailed them, when Duddingston himself appeared in his shirt\r\nupon the gunwale and asked who it was that approached. The leader of the\r\nparty answered with a profusion of oaths that he was the sheriff of the\r\ncounty, come to arrest him, and while he was speaking one of his men\r\ndeliberately shot the lieutenant, who fell, badly wounded, on the deck.\r\nIn another minute the \"Gaspee\" was boarded and taken without any loss to\r\nthe attacking party. The crew was overpowered, bound and placed upon the\r\nshore. Duddingston, his wounds having been dressed, was landed at a\r\nneighboring house. The party set fire to the \"Gaspee,\" and while its\r\nflames announced to the whole county the success of the expedition, they\r\nreturned, in broad daylight to Providence. Large rewards were offered by\r\nthe British government for their detection, but though they were\r\nuniversally known, no evidence could be obtained, and the outrage was\r\nentirely unpunished. It is to be observed that this act of piracy and\r\nopen warfare against the government was committed by the citizens of a\r\ncolony that had no cause for controversy with the home government, and\r\nwhose constitution was such a liberal one that it was not found\r\nnecessary to change one word of it when the province became an\r\nindependent republic.\r\n\r\nGeneral Gage, being informed that powder and other warlike stores were\r\nbeing collected in surrounding towns for the purpose of being used\r\nagainst the government, he sent, on Sept. 1, 1774, two hundred soldiers\r\nup the Mystic river, who took from the powder house 212 barrels of\r\npowder, and brought off two field-pieces from Cambridge. On April 18,\r\n1775, at 10 o'clock at night, eight hundred men embarked from Boston\r\nCommon and crossed the Charles river in boats to the Cambridge shore.\r\nAt the same time Paul Revere rowed across the river, lower down, and\r\nlanded in Charlestown, and then, on horseback, went in advance of the\r\ntroops to alarm the country. He was pursued, and with another scout\r\nnamed Dawes, was captured by the troops. At the dawn of day Lexington\r\nwas reached, 12 miles distant from Boston, where the troops were\r\nconfronted on the village green by the Lexington militia, which was\r\nordered by the commander of the British expedition to disperse, but\r\nfailing to do so they were fired on by the troops, and several of them\r\nkilled. The militia dispersed without firing a shot.\r\n\r\nThe troops gave three cheers in token of their victory, and continued\r\ntheir march to Concord, their objective point, where they were informed\r\nmunitions of war were being collected. They arrived there at 9 o'clock,\r\nand after destroying the stores collected there, they took up their\r\nmarch for Boston. But now the alarm had spread through the country. The\r\ntroops had hardly commenced marching, when, crossing the North Bridge\r\nthey were fired upon by the Americans; one soldier was killed and\r\nanother wounded.[39]\r\n\r\n  [39] As the wounded soldier was crawling away he was met by a boy who\r\n  had been chopping wood, and who, inflamed by the spirit of the hour,\r\n  killed him with his axe. The two soldiers lay buried near the stonewall\r\n  where they fell. More than a century later a young woman came here\r\n  recently from Nottinghamshire, who was a relative of one of them. She\r\n  went to the graves and placed upon them a wreath, singing as she did so,\r\n  \"God save the King!\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Davis and Abner Hosmer, two Americans, were killed by the\r\nBritish fire. On the march towards Boston the troops were met by the\r\nfire of the Americans from the stonewalls on either side of the highway,\r\nalong the skirt of every wood or orchard, and from every house or barn\r\nor cover in sight. The troops, exposed to such a galling attack in flank\r\nand rear, must have surrendered had they not been met with\r\nreinforcements from Boston. This very emergency had been anticipated,\r\nand General Gage had sent out a brigade of a thousand men, and two\r\nfield-pieces, under Earl Percy. The forces met at Lexington about 2\r\no'clock in the afternoon. After a short interval of rest and\r\nrefreshment, the troops took up their line of march for Boston. At every\r\npoint on the road they met an increasing number of militia, who by this\r\ntime had gathered in such force as to constitute a formidable foe. It\r\nwas a terrible march. Many were killed, on both sides, and it was with\r\nthe greatest difficulty that Lord Percy was able at last, about sunset,\r\nto bring his command to Charlestown Neck under cover of the ships of\r\nwar. The troops lost that day in killed, wounded, and missing, 273; the\r\nAmericans, 93. The war of the Revolution had commenced. The fratricidal\r\nstruggle was entered into, between men of the same race and blood who\r\nhad stood shoulder to shoulder in many a hard-fought field; brothers,\r\nfathers and sons, were to engage in a deadly struggle that should last\r\nfor years, and which, eighty-six years after wards, was to be repeated\r\nover again in the war between the North and South.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n_THE LOYALISTS OF MASSACHUSETTS._\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the American rebellion the great majority of men in\r\nthe colonies could be regarded as indifferent, ready to stampede and\r\nrush along with the successful party. Loyalty was their normal\r\ncondition; the state _had_ existed and _did_ exist, and it was the\r\ndisunionists who must do the converting, the changing of men's opinion\r\nto suit a new order of things which the disunionists believed necessary\r\nfor their welfare. Opposed to the revolutionists were the crown\r\nofficials, dignified and worthy gentlemen, who held office by virtue of\r\na wise selection. Hardly to be distinguished from the official class\r\nwere the clergy of the Established Church, who were partially dependent\r\nfor their livings upon the British government. The officers and clergy\r\nreceived the support of the landowners and the substantial business men,\r\nthe men who were satisfied with the existing order of things. The\r\naristocracy of culture, of dignified professions and callings, of\r\nofficial rank and hereditary wealth, was, in a large measure, found in\r\nthe Loyalist party. Such worthy and talented men of high social\r\npositions were the leaders of the opposition to the rebellion.\r\nSupporting them was the natural conservatism of all prosperous men. The\r\nmen who had abilities which could not be recognized under the existing\r\nregime, and those that form the lower strata of every society and are\r\nevery ready to overthrow the existing order of things, these were the\r\nones who were striving to bring about a change--a revolution.\r\n\r\nThe persecution of the Loyalists by the Sons of Despotism, or the \"Sons\r\nof Liberty,\" as they called themselves, was mercilessly carried out;\r\nevery outrage conceivable was practiced upon them. Freedom of speech was\r\nsuppressed; the liberty of the press destroyed; the voice of truth\r\nsilenced, and throughout the colonies was established a lawless power.\r\nAs early as 1772 \"committees of correspondence\" had been organized\r\nthroughout Massachusetts. Adams exclaimed in admiration: \"What an\r\nengine! France imitated it and produced a revolution.\"[40] Leonard, the\r\nLoyalist, with \"abhorrence pronounced it the foulest, subtlest and most\r\nvenomous serpent ever issued from the egg of sedition.\"[41] Insult and\r\nthreat met the Loyalist at every turn. One day he was, perhaps, set upon\r\na cake of ice to cool his loyalty,[42] and was then informed that a\r\ncertain famous liberty man had sworn to be his butcher. Next he was told\r\nthat he might expect a \"sans benito\" of tar and feathers, and even an\r\n\"auto da fe.\" The committee sent \"Patriot\" newspapers and other\r\npropaganda to the wavering or obstinate, but seldom failed to follow\r\nthis system of conversion with a personal interview if the literature\r\nfailed. Such were the means that were used by the \"Sons of Despotism\" to\r\nbring over the mass of the people to the disunion cause.\r\n\r\n  [40] John Adams' Letters. Vol. X, page 197.\r\n\r\n  [41] \"Massachusettsensis.\"\r\n\r\n  [42] \"Moor's Diary.\" Vol. I., page 359.\r\n\r\nIn the courts of law, not even the rights of a foreigner were left to\r\nthe Loyalist. If his neighbors owed him money he had no legal redress\r\nuntil he took an oath that he favored American independence. All legal\r\naction was denied him. He might be assaulted, insulted, blackmailed or\r\nslandered, though the law did not state it so boldly, yet he had no\r\nrecourse in law. No relative or friend could leave an orphan child, to\r\nhis guardianship. He could be the executor or administrator of no man's\r\nestate. He could neither buy land nor transfer it to another; he was\r\ndenied his vocation and his liberty to speak or write his opinions. All\r\nthese restrictions were not found in any one place, nor at any one time,\r\nnor were they always rigorously enforced. Viewed from the distance of\r\none hundred years, the necessity of such barbarous severity is not now\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nWhen this ostracism was approved by a large majority of the inhabitants\r\nof a town the victim was practically expelled from the community. None\r\ndared to give him food or comfort. He was a pariah, and to countenance\r\nhim was to incur public wrath.\r\n\r\nOn January 17, 1777, Massachusetts passed an Act punishing with death\r\nthe \"Crime of adhering to Great Britain.\" The full extent of this law\r\nwas not carried into effect in Massachusetts, but it was in other\r\ncolonies. The \"Black List\" of Pennsylvania contained the names of 490\r\npersons attainted of high treason. Only a few actually suffered the\r\nextreme penalty. Among these were two citizens of Philadelphia--Mr.\r\nRoberts and Mr. Carlisle. When the British army evacuated Philadelphia,\r\nthey remained, although warned of their danger. They were at once seized\r\nby the returning disunionists and condemned to be hanged. Mr. Roberts's\r\nwife and children went before congress and on their knees supplicated\r\nfor mercy, but in vain. In carrying out the sentence the two men, with\r\nhalters around their necks, were walked to the gallows behind a cart,\r\n\"attended with all the apparatus which makes such scenes truly\r\nhorrible.\" A guard of militia accompanied them; but few spectators.[43]\r\n\r\n  [43] \"Penn Packet,\" Nov. 17, 1778. \"Penn Archives,\" Vol. VIII, page 22.\r\n  \"Dallis,\" Vol. I., pp 39, 42; \"Galloway's Examinations,\" page 77.\r\n\r\nAt the gallows Mr. Roberts' behavior, wrote a loyal friend, \"did honor\r\nto human nature,\" and both showed fortitude and composure.\r\n\r\nRoberts told his audience that his conscience acquitted him of guilt:\r\nthat he suffered for doing his duty to his sovereign; that his blood\r\nwould one day be required at their hands. Turning to his children he\r\ncharged and exhorted them to remember his principles for which he died,\r\nand to adhere to them while they had breath. \"He suffered with the\r\nresolution of a Roman,\" wrote a witness.\r\n\r\nAfter the execution, the bodies of the two men were carried away by\r\nfriends and their burial was attended by over 4000 in procession.[44]\r\nSome of the more heartless leaders of the rebellion defended this\r\nseverity of treatment and thought \"hanging the traitors\" would have a\r\ngood effect and \"give stability to the new government.\" \"One suggested\r\nthat the Tories seemed designed for this purpose by Providence.\"[44] The\r\nmore thoughtful leaders, however, denounced the trial of Loyalists for\r\ntreason, and Washington feared that it might prove a dangerous\r\nexpedient. It was true, he granted, that they had joined the British\r\nafter such an offence had been declared to be treason; but as they had\r\nnot taken the oath, nor entered into the American service, it would be\r\nsaid that they had a right to choose their side. \"Again,\" he added, \"by\r\nthe same rule that we try them may not the enemy try any natural-born\r\nsubject of Great Britain taken in arms in our service? We have a great\r\nnumber of them and I, therefore, think we had better submit to the\r\nnecessity of treating a few individuals who may really deserve a severer\r\nfate, as prisoners of war, than run the risk of giving an opening for\r\nretaliation upon the Europeans in our service.\"[45]\r\n\r\n  [44] \"Records of North Carolina,\" Vol. XI., page 561.\r\n\r\n  [45] \"Washington's Writings,\" Vol. VI., page 241.\r\n\r\nAmerican writers never fail to tell of the \"brutal and inhuman\r\ntreatment\" of the American prisoners by the British in the prisons and\r\nprison-ships at New York, where about five thousand prisoners were\r\nconfined. We are informed that their sufferings in the prison-ships were\r\ngreater than those in the prisons on land; that \"every morning the\r\nprisoners brought up their bedding to be aired, and after washing the\r\ndecks, they were allowed to remain above till sunset, when they were\r\nordered below with imprecations and the savage cry, \"Down, rebels!\r\nDown!\" The hatches were then closed, and in serried ranks they lay down\r\nto sleep,\" etc.[46] That many died from dysentery, smallpox and prison\r\nfever, there is no doubt; but there is not any record that _they were\r\nstarved to death_. Compare the above treatment of prisoners by the\r\nBritish with that of the Loyalists by the disunionists! In East Granby,\r\nConnecticut, was situated an underground prison which surpassed the\r\nhorrors of the Black Hole of Calcutta. These barbarities and\r\ninhumanities were the portion of those who had been guilty of loyalty to\r\ntheir country, a social class distinguished by both their public and\r\nprivate virtues. It seemed almost incredible that their\r\nfellow-countrymen should have confined them in a place unfit for human\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\n [46] Lossing, \"Field Book of the Revolution,\" Vol. II., page 661.\r\n\r\nThis den of horrors, known as \"Newgate Prison,\" was an old worked-out\r\ncopper mine, sixty feet under ground, in the hills of East Granby. The\r\nonly entrance to it was by means of a ladder down a shaft which led to\r\nthe caverns under ground. The darkness was intense; the caves reeked\r\nwith filth; vermin abounded; water trickled from the roof and oozed from\r\nthe sides of the cavern; huge masses of earth were perpetually falling\r\noff. In the dampness and the filth the clothing of the prisoners grew\r\nmouldy and rotted away, and their limbs became stiff with rheumatism.\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolutionary war Loyalists of importance were confined in\r\nthis place of horrors, then of national importance, although now but\r\nseldom referred to by American writers. Loyalists were consigned to it\r\nfor safe keeping by Washington himself. In a letter dated December 11,\r\n1775, addressed to the Committee of Safety, Simsbury, Conn., he informed\r\nthem that the \"charges of their imprisonment will be at the Continental\r\nexpense,\" and \"to confine them in such manner so that they cannot\r\npossibly make their escape.\"[47]\r\n\r\n  [47] \"History of Simsbury and Granby,\" page 125.\r\n\r\n\"Driven to desperation the Loyalists rose against their guards. About 10\r\no'clock at night, on the 18th of May, 1781, when all the guards but two\r\nhad retired to rest, a wife of one of the prisoners appeared, to whom\r\npermission was given to visit her husband in the cavern. Upon the\r\nhatches being removed to admit her passing down, the prisoners who were\r\nat the door, and prepared for the encounter, rushed up, seized the gun\r\nof the sentry on duty, who made little or no resistance, and became\r\nmaster of the guard-room before those who were asleep could be aroused\r\nto make defence. The officer of the guard who resisted was killed, and\r\nothers wounded. The guard was easily overcome, a few sought safety in\r\nflight, but the greater number were disarmed by the prisoners. The\r\nprisoners, numbering twenty-eight persons, having equipped themselves\r\nwith the captured arms, escaped, and, with few exceptions avoided\r\nrecapture.\"[48]\r\n\r\n  [48] \"History of Simsbury and Granby,\" pp. 123, 124.\r\n\r\nThe heart sickens at the recital of the sufferings of the Loyalists, and\r\nwe turn in disgust from the views which the pen of faithful history\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\nAfter the legislation of 1778 every grievance the colonists had put\r\nforward as a reason for taking up arms had been redressed, every claim\r\nthey had presented had been abandoned, and from the time when the\r\nEnglish parliament surrendered all right of taxation and internal\r\nlegislation in the colonies, and when the English Commissioners laid\r\ntheir propositions before the Americans, the character of the war had\r\nwholly changed. It was no longer a war for self-taxation and\r\nconstitutional liberty. It was now an attempt, with the assistance of\r\nFrance and Spain, to establish independence by shattering the British\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nThere were brave and honest men in America who were proud of the great\r\nand free empire to which they belonged, who had no desire to shirk the\r\nburden of maintaining it, who remembered with gratitude that it was not\r\ncolonial, but all English blood that had been shed around Quebec and\r\nMontreal in defence of the colonies. Men who with nothing to hope for\r\nfrom the crown were prepared to face the most brutal mob violence and\r\nthe invectives of a scurrilous press; to risk their fortunes, their\r\nreputation, and sometimes even their lives, in order to avert civil war\r\nand ultimate separation. Most of them ended their days in poverty and\r\nexile, and, as the supporters of a beaten cause, history has paid but a\r\nscanty tribute to their memory. But they comprised some of the best and\r\nablest men America has ever produced, and they were contending for an\r\nideal which was at least as worthy as that for which Washington fought.\r\n\r\nIt was the maintenance of one great, free, industrial, and pacific\r\nempire, comprising the whole British race, holding the richest plains of\r\nAsia in possession, blending all that was most venerable in an ancient\r\ncivilization with the abundant energies of a youthful social combination\r\nlikely in a few generations to outstrip every commercial competitor, and\r\nto acquire an indisputable ascendency among the nations. Such an ideal\r\nwas a noble one, and there were Americans who were prepared to make any\r\npersonal sacrifice to realize it. These men were the LOYALISTS of the\r\nRevolution. Consider what the result would be today had not this\r\n\"Anglo-Saxon Schism,\" as Goldwin Smith calls it, taken place. There\r\nwould be a great English-speaking nation of 130,000,000 that could\r\ndominate the world. They would in all substantial respects be one\r\npeople, in language, literature, institutions, and social usages,\r\nwhether settled in South Africa, in Australia, in the primitive home, or\r\nin North America.\r\n\r\nBecause the Revolution had its origin in Massachusetts, and the old Bay\r\nState furnished a large part of the men and the means to carry it to a\r\nsuccessful issue,[49] it seems to have been taken for granted that the\r\npeople embraced the popular side almost in a mass.\r\n\r\n  [49] The Southern States furnished 59,330 men; the Middle States 54,116,\r\n  and New England 118,355, of which number Massachusetts furnished 67,907.\r\n  (\"General Knox's Report.\")\r\n\r\nA more mistaken opinion than this has seldom prevailed. At the\r\nevacuation of Boston, General Gage was accompanied by eleven hundred\r\nLoyalists, which included the best people of the town. Boston at that\r\ntime had a population of 16,000. \"Among these persons of distinguished\r\nrank and consideration there were members of the council, commissioners,\r\nofficers of the customs, and other officials, amounting to one hundred\r\nand two; of clergymen, eighteen; of inhabitants of country towns, one\r\nhundred and five; of merchants and other persons who resided in Boston,\r\ntwo hundred and thirteen; of farmers, mechanics and traders, three\r\nhundred and eighty-two.\"[50]\r\n\r\n  [50] Sabine, \"Loyalists of the Revolution,\" Vol. I., page 25.\r\n\r\nCambridge lost nearly all her men of mark and high standing; nearly all\r\nthe country towns were thus bereft of the very persons who had been the\r\nmost honored and revered. With the exiles were nearly one hundred\r\ngraduates of Harvard college.\r\n\r\nAmong the proscribed and banished were members of the old historic\r\nfamilies, Hutchinson, Winthrop, Saltonstall, Quincy, the Sewells, and\r\nWinslows, families of which the exiled members were not one whit behind\r\nthose that remained, in intelligence, social standing and moral worth.\r\n\r\nAt the evacuation of New York and Savannah no fewer than 30,000 persons\r\nleft the United States for Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. From northern\r\nNew York and Vermont the Loyalists crossed over into Upper Canada, and\r\nlaid the foundations of that prosperous province under the vigorous\r\nleadership of Governor Simcoe, who, during the war, commanded a regiment\r\nof Loyalist rangers which had done efficient service. Many of the\r\nSouthern Loyalists settled in Florida, the Bahamas and the West India\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nFamiliar New England names meet one at every turn in the maritime\r\nprovinces, especially Nova Scotia. Dr. Inglis, from Trinity church, New\r\nYork, was the first bishop, and Judge Sewell, of Massachusetts, the\r\nfirst chief justice there. The harshness of the laws and the greed of\r\nthe new commonwealth had driven into exile men who could be ill spared,\r\nand whose absence showed itself in the lack of balance and of political\r\nsteadiness which characterized the early history of the republic, while\r\nthe newly-founded colonies, composed almost exclusively of\r\nconservatives, were naturally slow, but sure, in their development. The\r\nmen who were willing to give up home, friends and property, for an idea,\r\nare not men to be despised; they are, rather, men for us to claim with\r\npride and honor as American--men of the same blood, and the same speech\r\nas ourselves; Americans who were true to their convictions and who\r\nsuffered everything except the loss of liberty, for their political\r\nfaith. We look in vain among the lists of voluntary and banished\r\nrefugees from Massachusetts for a name on which rests any tradition of\r\ndisgrace or infamy, to which the finger of scorn can be pointed. Can\r\nthis be said of the Revolutionary leaders of Massachusetts, the\r\nso-called patriots, to whom the Revolution owes its inception? If the\r\nreader has any doubts on this subject, then let him compare the lives of\r\nthe Loyalists, as given in this work, with those of Samuel Adams, John\r\nHancock, and other Revolutionary leaders. The Loyalists were generally\r\npeople of substance; their stake in the country was greater, even, than\r\nthat of their opponents; their patriotism, no doubt, fully as fervent.\r\n\"There is much that is melancholy, of which the world knows but little,\r\nconnected with this expulsion from the land they sincerely loved. The\r\nestates of the Loyalists were among the fairest, their stately mansions\r\nstood on the sightliest hill-brows, the richest and best-tilled meadows\r\nwere their farms; the long avenue, the broad lawn, the trim hedge about\r\nthe garden, servants, plate, pictures, for the most part these things\r\nwere at the homes of the Loyalists. They loved beauty, dignity and\r\nrefinement.\" The rude contact of town meetings was offensive to their\r\ntastes. The crown officials were courteous, well-born and congenial\r\ngentlemen.\r\n\r\n\"The graceful, the chivalrous, the poetic, the spirits over whom these\r\nfeelings had power, were sure to be Loyalists. Democracy was something\r\nrude and coarse, and independence to them meant a severance of those\r\nconnections of which a colonist ought to be proudest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hence when the country rose, many a high-bred, honorable gentleman,\r\nturned the key in his door, drove down his tree-lined avenue with his\r\nrefined dame and carefully-guarded children at his side, turned his back\r\non his handsome estate, and put himself under the shelter of the proud\r\nbanner of St. George. It was a mere temporary refuge, he thought, and he\r\npromised himself a speedy return when discipline and loyalty should have\r\nput down the rabble and the misled rustics.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the return was never to be. The day went against them; they crowded\r\ninto ships, with the gates of their country barred forever behind them.\r\nThey found themselves penniless upon shores sometimes bleak and barren,\r\nalways showing scant hospitality to outcasts who came empty-handed, and\r\nthere they were forced to begin life anew. Consider the condition of\r\nHutchinson, Apthorp, Gray, Clarke, Faneuil, Sewell, Royal, Vassall, and\r\nLeonard, families of honorable note bound in with all that was best in\r\nthe life of the Province.\" \"Who can think of their destiny\r\nunpityingly.\"[51]\r\n\r\n  [51] Hosmer's \"Life of Hutchinson.\" pages 321, 322.\r\n\r\nA man suspected of loyalty to the crown was not left at peace, but was\r\nliable to peremptory banishment unless he would swear allegiance to the\r\n\"Sons of Liberty,\" and if he returned he was subject to forcible\r\ndeportation, and to death on the gallows if he returned a second time.\r\n\r\nOne of the first acts of the revolutionary party when they returned to\r\nBoston after the British evacuation, was to confiscate and sell all\r\nproperty belonging to Loyalists and apply the receipts to supply the\r\npublic needs. The names and fate of a considerable proportion of these\r\nLoyalists and those that preceded and succeeded the Boston emigration,\r\nwill be found in succeeding pages. Most of them went to Halifax, Nova\r\nScotia, and St. John, New Brunswick, where they endured great privation.\r\nMany, however, subsequently went to England and there passed the\r\nremainder of their lives. We find seventy or more of the Massachusetts\r\nLoyalists holding offices of greater or less importance in the\r\nprovinces, and many of them were employed in places of high trust and\r\nlarge influence in various parts of the Empire. They and their sons\r\nfilled for more than half a century the chief offices in the Nova Scotia\r\nand New Brunswick judiciary, and they and their descendants must have\r\ncontributed in a degree not easily estimated to the elevation and\r\nprogress of those provinces.\r\n\r\n  Men whose fathers, mocked and broken\r\n    For the honor of a name.\r\n  Would not wear the conqueror's token,\r\n    Could not salt their bread with shame.\r\n\r\n  Plunged them in the virgin forest\r\n    With their axes in their hands,\r\n  Built a Province as a bulwark\r\n    For the loyal of the lands.\r\n\r\n  Won it by the axe and harrow,\r\n    Held it by the axe and sword,\r\n  Bred a race with brawn and marrow,\r\n    From no alien over-lord.\r\n  Gained the right to guide and govern;\r\n    Then with labor strong and free\r\n  Forged the land a shield of Empire,\r\n    Silver sea to silver sea.\r\n\r\n  --Duncan C. Scott.\r\n\r\nIn this way the United States, out of their own children, built upon\r\ntheir borders a colony of rivals in navigation and the fisheries, whose\r\nloyalty to the British crown was sanctified by misfortune. It is\r\nimpossible to say how many of these Loyalists would have been on the\r\nRevolutionists' side had the party opposed to the crown been kept under\r\nthe control of its leaders. But they were, most of them, of the class of\r\nmen that would have the least amount of tolerance for outrage and\r\nrapine, and when we consider how closely they were identified with the\r\ninstitutions of their native province, and how little remains on record\r\nof anything like rancor or malignity on their part, there can be little\r\ndoubt that a considerable proportion of them would have been saved for\r\nthe republic but for the very acts which posterity has been foolish\r\nenough to applaud, and for their loss Massachusetts was appreciably the\r\npoorer for more than one or two generations.\r\n\r\nIt is also admitted by those who are authorities on the subject, that if\r\nit had not been for the brutal and intolerant persecution of the\r\nLoyalists, the ruthless driving of these unfortunate people from their\r\nhomes, with the subsequent confiscation of property, the attempt to\r\nthrow off the authority of Great Britain at the time of the\r\nRevolutionary War would not have succeeded; that is, people entirely or\r\nat least reasonably content with the previous political condition were\r\nterrorized into becoming patriots by the fear of the consequences that\r\nwould follow if they remained Loyalists.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that, as far as the Americans were in it, the war of the\r\nRevolution was a civil war in which the two sides were not far from\r\nequality in numbers, in social conditions, and in their manners and\r\ncustoms. The Loyalists contended all through the war that they were in a\r\nnumerical majority, and if they could have been properly supported by\r\nBritish forces, the war might have ended in 1777, before the French\r\nalliance had given hope and strength to the separatist party. Sabine\r\ncomputes that there were at least 25,000 Americans in the military\r\nservice of the King, at one time or another, during the wars. In New\r\nYork, New Jersey, the Carolinas, and Georgia, the Loyalists outnumbered\r\nthe Revolutionists. Even in New England, the nursery of the Revolution,\r\nthe number was so large and so formidable, in the opinion of the\r\nRevolutionary leaders, that in order to suppress them there was\r\nestablished a reign of terror, anticipating the famous \"Law of the\r\nSuspected\" of the French Revolution. An irresponsible tyranny was\r\nestablished, of town and country committees, at whose beck and call were\r\nthe so-called \"Sons of Liberty.\" To these committees was entrusted\r\nabsolute power over the lives and fortunes of their fellow citizens, and\r\nthey proceeded on principles of evidence that would have shocked and\r\nscandalized a grand inquisitor.[52]\r\n\r\n  [52] \"Essays in American History,\" 180-181.\r\n\r\nThe rigorous measures adopted by the new governments in New England\r\nStates, and the activity of their town committees, succeeded in either\r\ndriving out these Loyalist citizens, or reducing them to harmless\r\ninactivity. In New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, the Carolinas and\r\nGeorgia, they remained strong and active throughout the war, and loyalty\r\nwas in those states in the ascendancy.\r\n\r\nIf the Loyalists were really a majority, as they claimed to be, the\r\ndisunionists were determined to break them up. Loyalists were tarred and\r\nfeathered and carried on rails, gagged and bound for days at a time;\r\nstoned, fastened in a room with a fire and the chimney stopped on top;\r\nadvertised as public enemies, so that they would be cut off from all\r\ndealings with their neighbors; they had bullets shot into their\r\nbedrooms, their horses poisoned or mutilated; money or valuable plate\r\nextorted from them to save them from violence, and on pretence of taking\r\nsecurity for their good behavior; their houses and ships burned; they\r\nwere compelled to pay the guards who watched them in their houses, and\r\nwhen carted about for the mob to stare at and abuse, they were compelled\r\nto pay something at every town. For the three months of July, August and\r\nSeptember of the year 1776, one can find in the American archives alone\r\nover thirty descriptions of outrages of this kind, and all this done by\r\nso-called \"patriots\" in the name of liberty! In short, lynch law\r\nprevailed for many years during the Revolution, and the habit became so\r\nfixed that it has never been given up. It was taken from the name of the\r\nbrother of the man who founded Lynchburgh, Virginia.\r\n\r\nWherever the disunionists were most successful with this reign of\r\nterror, they drove all the judges from the bench, and abolished the\r\ncourts, and for a long time there were no courts or public\r\nadministration of the law, notably in New England.\r\n\r\nTo the mind of the Loyalists, all this lynching proceeding were an\r\nirrefragible proof not only that the disunionist party were wicked, but\r\nthat their idea of independence of a country free from British control\r\nand British law were silly delusions, dangerous to all good order and\r\ncivilization. That such a people could ever govern a country of their\r\nown and have in it that thing they were crying so much about,\r\n\"liberty,\" was in their opinion beyond the bounds of intelligent belief.\r\nA recent American writer says: \"The revolution was not by any means the\r\npretty social event that the ladies of the so-called 'patriotic'\r\nsocieties suppose it to have been. It was, on the contrary, a rank and\r\nriotous rebellion against the long-established authority of a nation\r\nwhich had saved us from France, built us up into prosperity, and if she\r\nwas ruling us today would, I am entirely willing to admit, abolish\r\nlynch-law, negro burning, municipal and legislative corruption, and all\r\nthe other evils about which reformers fret.\" The same writer also says:\r\n\"All that saved this country from complete annihilation was the\r\nassistance after 1778 of the French army, fleet, provisions, clothes,\r\nand loans of money, followed by assistance from Spain, and, at the last\r\nmoment, by the alliance of Holland, and even with all this assistance\r\nthe cause was, even as late as the year 1780, generally believed to be a\r\nhopeless one.\"[53] \"In fact, Washington, at this time, was prepared to\r\nbecome a guerilla.\" In case of being further pressed, he said: \"We must\r\nretire to Augusta County, in Virginia. Numbers will repair to us for\r\nsafety, and we will then try a predatory war. If overpowered, we must\r\ncross the Allegheny Mountains.\"[54]\r\n\r\n  [53] \"The American Revolution and Boer War,\" By Sidney Fisher, 1902.\r\n\r\n  [54] Irving's \"Life of Washington,\" Vol. II., chap. xli.\r\n\r\nThe question will naturally be asked why, if they were so numerous, were\r\nthey not more successful, why did they yield to popular violence in New\r\nEngland, and desert the country while the contest was going on, Why did\r\nthey not hold the Southern States, and keep them from joining the others\r\nin the Continental Congresses, and in the war?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, a negative attitude is necessarily an inactive one,\r\nand in consequence of this, and the fact that they could not take the\r\ninitiative in action, the Loyalists were put at a disadvantage before\r\nthe much better organization of the Revolutionary leaders. Though these\r\nwere few in number in the South, they were of families of great social\r\ninfluence, and in the North were popular agitators of long experience.\r\nThey manipulated the committee system so carefully that the colonies\r\nfound themselves, before they were aware of the tendency of the actions\r\nof their deputies, involved in proceedings of very questionable\r\nlegality, such as the boycotting agreement known as the \"American\r\nAssociation,\" and other proceedings of the Continental Congress.[55] In\r\nregard to the subject of legal attainder and exile, Mr. Sabine remarks,\r\nvery moderately and sensibly: \"Nor is it believed that either the\r\nbanishment or the confiscation laws, as they stood, were more expedient\r\nthan just. The latter did little towards relieving the public\r\nnecessities, and served only to create a disposition for rapacity, and\r\nto increase the wealth of favored individuals. Had the estates which\r\nwere seized and sold been judiciously or honestly managed, a\r\nconsiderable sum would have found its way to the treasury; but, as it\r\nwas, the amount was inconsiderable. Some of the wisest and purest Whigs\r\nof the time hung their heads in shame because of the passage of measures\r\nso unjustifiable, and never ceased to speak of them in terms of\r\nreprobation. Mr. Jay's disgust was unconquerable, and he never would\r\npurchase any property that had been forfeited under the Confiscation Act\r\nof New York.\"[56]\r\n\r\n  [55] \"Essays in American History,\" 179. See also \"Royalists' Archives,\"\r\nMass.

Not two pence on the pound have arrived to the public treasury\r\nof all the confiscation.\"[57]\r\n\r\n  [57] The \"Journal and Letters of Samuel Curwin,\" 147.\r\n\r\n\"The Loyalists, to a great extent, sprung from and represented the old\r\ngentry of the country. The prospect of seizing their property had been\r\none great motive which induced many to enter the war. The new owners of\r\nthe confiscated property now grasped the helm. New men exercised the\r\nsocial influence of the old families, and they naturally dreaded the\r\nrestoration of those whom they had dispossessed.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of the war, the Revolutionists committed a great crime.\r\nInstead of repealing the proscription and banishment acts, as justice\r\nand good policy required, they manifested a spirit to place the humbled\r\nand unhappy Loyalists beyond the pale of human sympathy. Hostilities at\r\nan end, mere loyalty should have been forgiven. When, in the civil war\r\nbetween the Puritans and the Stuarts, the former gained the ascendancy,\r\nand when at a later period the Commonwealth was established, Cromwell\r\nand his party wisely determined not to banish nor inflict disabilities\r\non their opponents, and so, too, at the restoration of the monarchy, so\r\ngeneral was the amnesty act in its provisions that it was termed an act\r\nof oblivion to the _friends_ of Charles, and of grateful remembrance to\r\nhis _foes_. The happy consequences which resulted from the conduct of\r\n_both_ parties, and in both cases, were before the men of their own\r\npolitical and religious sympathies, the Puritans of the North and the\r\nCavaliers of the South in America, but neither of them profited by it,\r\nat that time; but since then the wisdom of it has been exemplified by\r\nthe happy consequences which have resulted to both parties engaged in\r\nthe war of secession, where the United States wisely determined not to\r\nbanish, confiscate, or inflict any disabilities on their opponents in\r\nthe late seceded states.\r\n\r\nThe crime having been committed, thousands ruined and banished, new\r\nBritish colonies founded, animosities to continue for generations made\r\ncertain, the violent Revolutionists of Massachusetts, New York and\r\nVirginia, were satisfied: all this accomplished and the statute-book was\r\ndivested of its most objectionable enactments, and a few of the\r\nLoyalists returned to their old homes, but by far the greater part died\r\nin banishment.\r\n\r\nNo one who studies the history of the American Revolution can fail to be\r\nconvinced that the persecution of the Loyalists had for its final result\r\nthe severance of the North American continent into two nations. The\r\npeople who inhabited Nova Scotia prior to the Revolution were largely\r\nNew England settlers, who dispossessed the Acadians, and who for the\r\nmost part sympathized with the revolutionary movement. But for the\r\nbanishment of the Loyalists, Nova Scotia would have long continued with\r\nbut a very sparse population, and certainly could never have hoped to\r\nobtain so enterprising, active, and energetic a set of inhabitants as\r\nthose who were supplied to it by the acts of the several states hostile\r\nto the Loyalists. The same can also be said of Upper Canada. The hold of\r\nthe British government upon the British provinces of North America which\r\nremained to the crown, would have been slight indeed, but for the active\r\nhostility of the Loyalists to their former fellow-countrymen. They\r\ncreated the state of affairs which consolidated British power on this\r\ncontinent, and built it up into the Dominion of Canada, which in another\r\ncentury will probably contain one hundred million inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of peace with Great Britain, like other documents of its\r\nkind, contained provisions of give and take. After signature by the\r\ncommissioners in Paris it was ratified with due consideration by the\r\nContinental Congress. The advantages which it secured were not merely of\r\na sentimental nature, but material. It was justly regarded by\r\nenlightened citizens of the states as a triumph of diplomacy. The credit\r\nof Britain in the bargain was more of the heart than of the head. She\r\nwas willing to concede substantial and important benefits in order to\r\nsecure the lives and property of the Loyalists who had clung to her and\r\nhad sustained her arms. Looking at the matter now, in a cool light, she\r\nblundered into sacrifices that were altogether needless, even with this\r\naim in view, and knowledge of the knavery that was to follow.\r\n\r\nThe game was played, and she had lost. North America, in the eyes of her\r\nstatesmen, was a strip of eastern seaboard; the great lakes were but\r\ndimly understood; the continent beyond the Mississippi was ignored. She\r\ngave much more than she needed to have given both in east and west, to\r\nattain her honorable end, and what was more immediately distressing, she\r\nreceived little or no value in return for her liberal concession.\r\n\r\n\"That each party should hold what it possesses, is the first point from\r\nwhich nations set out in framing a treaty of peace. If one side gives up\r\na part of its acquisitions, the other side renders an equivalent in some\r\nother way. What is the equivalent given to Great Britain for all the\r\nimportant concessions she has made? She has surrendered the capital of\r\nthis state (New York) and its large dependencies. She is to surrender\r\nour immensely valuable posts on the frontier, and to yield to us a vast\r\ntract of western territory, with one-half of the lakes, by which we\r\nshall command almost the whole fur trade. She renounces to us her claim\r\nto the navigation of the Mississippi and admits us to share in the\r\nfisheries even on better terms than we formerly enjoyed. As she was in\r\npossession, by right of war, of all these objects, whatever may have\r\nbeen our original pretensions to them, they are, by the laws of nations,\r\nto be considered as so much given up on her part. And what do we give in\r\nreturn? We stipulate that there shall be no future injury to her\r\nadherents among us. How insignificant the equivalent in comparison with\r\nthe acquisition! A man of sense would be ashamed to compare them, a man\r\nof honesty, not intoxicated with passion, would blush to lisp a question\r\nof the obligation to observe the stipulation on our part.\"[58] In return\r\nfor these advantages which Hamilton informs us Great Britain gave to the\r\nStates, Congress had most solemnly undertaken three things, and people,\r\nwearied by the sufferings of our eight years' war, would have gladly\r\npurchased the blessings of peace at a much higher price. The first of\r\nthese conditions was that no obstacle or impediment should be put in the\r\nway of the recovery of debts due to British subjects from the citizens\r\nof the Republic; the second that no fresh prosecution or confiscation\r\nshould be directed against Loyalists; the third, that Congress should\r\nsincerely recommend to the legislatures of the various states a repeal\r\nof the existing acts of confiscation, which affected the property of\r\nthese unfortunate persons. On the last no stress could be laid, but the\r\nfirst and second were understood by every man, honest or dishonest, in\r\nthe same sense as when peace was joyfully accepted. The American states\r\ntook the benefits of peace which the efforts of Congress had secured to\r\nthem, they accepted the advantages of the treaty which their\r\nrepresentative had signed, they watched and waited until the troops of\r\nKing George were embarked in transports at New York for England, and\r\nthen proceeded to deny, in a variety of tones, all powers in the central\r\ngovernment to bind them in the matter of the _quid pro quo_. It was not\r\na great thing which Congress had undertaken to do, or one which could be\r\nof any material advantage to their late enemy. All their promises\r\namounted to was that they would abstain from the degradation of a petty\r\nand personal revenge, and this promise they proceeded to break in every\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\n  [58] The Works of Alexander Hamilton, by H. C. Lodge, 2d edition, Vol.\r\n  IV., page 239.\r\n\r\nAs Hamilton wisely and nobly urged, the breach was not only a despicable\r\nperfidy, but an impolitic act, since Loyalists might become good\r\ncitizens and the state needed nothing more urgently than population. But\r\nno sooner was danger at a distance, embarked on transports, than the\r\nstates assumed an attitude of defiance. The thirteen legislatures vied\r\nwith one another in the ingenuity of measures for defeating the recovery\r\nof debts due to British creditors. They derided the recommendation to\r\nrepeal oppressive acts, and to restore confiscated property, and\r\nproceeded, without regard either for honor or consequences, to pass new\r\nacts of wider oppression and to order confiscation on a grander scale.\r\nThere was a practical unanimity in engaging in fresh persecutions of\r\nLoyalists, not merely by the enactment of oppressive civil laws, but by\r\neven denying them the protection afforded by a just enforcement of the\r\ncriminal laws. In many districts these unfortunate persons were robbed,\r\ntortured, and even put to death with impunity, and over a hundred\r\nthousand driven into exile in Canada, Florida and the Bahamas.\r\n\r\nMeasures were passed amid popular rejoicing to obstruct the recovery of\r\ndebts due to British merchants and to enable the fortunate Americans to\r\nrevel unmolested in the pleasure of stolen fruits. It is remarkable how\r\nat this period public opinion was at once so childish and rotten, and\r\none is at a loss whether to marvel most at its recklessness of credit or\r\nits unvarnished dishonesty; it was entirely favorable to the idea of\r\nprivate theft, and the interest of rogues was considered with compassion\r\nby the grave and respectable citizens who composed the legislatures of\r\nthe various states. It was the same spirit which had violated the\r\nBurgoyne convention at Saratoga, the same which in later days preached\r\nthe gospel of repudiation, greenbackism, silver currency, violated\r\ntreaties with the Indians, that produced a \"Century of Dishonor.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the policy of breach of faith was producing its natural crop\r\nof inconvenience. Dishonest methods were not the unmixed advantages\r\nwhich these adherents had supposed, when they engaged upon them in a\r\nspirit of light-hearted cunning. For in spite of all the ill-feeling, a\r\nlarge demand arose for British goods. For these, specie had to be paid\r\ndown on the nail in all cases where wares or material were not taken in\r\nexchange, since no British merchant would now give one pennyworth of\r\ncredit, out of respect to the measures of the various states for the\r\nobstruction of the payment of British debts. It was true that Britain\r\nwas in no mood to embark upon a fresh war for the punishment of broken\r\npromises. She had surrendered the chief hostage when she evacuated her\r\nstrategical position at New York, but she declined to hand over the\r\neight important frontier posts which she held upon the American side of\r\nthe line between Lake Michigan and Lake Champlain. These posts were much\r\nin themselves, and as a symbol of dominion to the Indian tribes. They\r\nwere much also as a matter of pride, while their retention carried with\r\nit the whole of the valuable fur trade, which consequently, until 1795,\r\nwhen they were at last surrendered, brought considerable profits to\r\nBritish merchants.\r\n\r\nTo the short-sighted policy which banished the Loyalists may be traced\r\nnearly all the political troubles of this continent, in which Britain\r\nand the United States have been involved. \"Dearly enough have the people\r\nof the United States paid for the crime of the violent Whigs of the\r\nRevolution, for to the Loyalists who were driven away, and to their\r\ndescendants, we owe almost entirely the long and bitter controversy\r\nrelative to our northeastern boundaries, and the dispute about our right\r\nto the fisheries in the colonial seas.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n_THE REVOLUTIONIST._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American Revolution, like most other revolutions, was the work of an\r\nenergetic minority who succeeded in committing an undecided and\r\nfluctuating majority to courses for which they had little love; leading\r\nthem, step by step, to a position from which it was impossible to\r\nrecede. To the last, however, we find vacillation, uncertainty, half\r\nmeasures, and, in large classes, a great apparent apathy. There was,\r\nalso, a great multitude, who, though they would never take up arms for\r\nthe king; though they, perhaps, agreed with the constitutional doctrines\r\nof the revolution, dissented on grounds of principle, policy, or\r\ninterest, from the course they were adopting.\r\n\r\nThat the foregoing is a correct presentation of the case is shown by a\r\nletter written by John Adams, when in Congress, to his wife. He says:\r\n\r\n\"I have found this congress like the last. When we first came together,\r\nI found a strong jealousy of us from New England, and the Massachusetts\r\nin particular--suspicions entertained of designs of independency, an\r\nAmerican republic, Presbyterian principles, and twenty other\r\nthings.\"[59]\r\n\r\n  [59] Letters of John Adams to His Wife, Vol. I., p. 45.\r\n\r\nIt was an open question with many whether a community liable to such\r\noutbreaks of popular fury did not need a strongly repressive government;\r\nand especially when the possibilities of a separation from the mother\r\ncountry was contemplated, it was a matter of doubt whether such a people\r\nwere fit for self-government. Was it not possible that the lawless and\r\nanarchical spirit which had of late years been steadily growing, and\r\nwhich the \"patriotic\" party had actively encouraged, would gain the\r\nupper hand, and the whole fabric of society would be dissolved?\r\n\r\nIn another letter of John Adams to his wife at this time, he gives us an\r\nidea of what the opinion was of the Loyalists concerning the doctrines\r\ntaught by the disunionists, and which, he says, \"Must be granted to be a\r\nlikeness.\" \"They give rise to profaneness, intemperance, thefts,\r\nrobberies, murders, and treason; cursing, swearing, drunkenness,\r\ngluttony, lewdness, trespassing, mains, are necessarily involved in\r\nthem. Besides they render the populace, the rabble, the scum of the\r\nearth, insolent and disorderly, impudent and abusive. They give rise to\r\nlying, hypocrisy, chicanery, and even perjury among the people, who are\r\ndrawn to such artifices and crime to conceal themselves and their\r\ncompanions from prosecution in consequence of them. This is the picture\r\ndrawn by the Tory pencil, and it must be granted to be a likeness.\"[60]\r\n\r\n  [60] Letters of John Adams to His Wife, Vol. I., p. 8.\r\n\r\nThere are several passages in the writings of John Adams that seem to\r\nindicate that he at times had doubts of the righteousness of the course\r\nhe had pursued. They were written in his later years, though one refers\r\nto an incident alleged to have occurred during his early manhood. In a\r\nletter to a friend in 1811, he thus moralizes: \"Have I not been employed\r\nin mischief all my days? Did not the American Revolution produce the\r\nFrench Revolution? And did not the French Revolution produce all the\r\ncalamities and desolations to the human race and the whole globe ever\r\nsince?\" But he justifies himself with the reflection: \"I meant well,\r\nhowever; my conscience was as clear as crystal glass, without a scruple\r\nor doubt. I was borne along by an irresistible sense of duty.\" In his\r\ndiary Mr. Adams recalls to mind one incident which occurred in 1775. He\r\nmentions the profound melancholy which fell upon him in one of the most\r\ncritical moments of the struggle, when a man whom he knew to be a\r\nhorse-jockey and a cheat, and whom, as an advocate, he had often\r\ndefended in the law courts, came to him and expressed the unbounded\r\ngratitude he felt for the great things which Adams and his colleagues\r\nhad done. \"We can never,\" he said, \"be grateful enough to you. There are\r\nnow no courts of justice in this province, and I hope there will never\r\nbe another.\" \"Is this the object,\" Adams continued, \"for which I have\r\nbeen contending?\" said I to myself. \"Are these the sentiments of such\r\npeople, and how many of them are there in the country? Half the nation,\r\nfor what I know; for half the nation are debtors, if not more, and these\r\nhave been in all the countries the sentiments of debtors. If the power\r\nof the country should get into such hands--and there is great danger\r\nthat it will--to what purpose have we sacrificed our time, health and\r\neverything else?\"[61]\r\n\r\n  [61] Adams' Works, Vol. II., 420.\r\n\r\nMisgivings of this kind must have passed through many minds. To some may\r\nhave come the warning words of Winthrop, the father of Boston, uttered\r\none hundred and fifty years before these events occurred, in which he\r\nsaid: \"Democracy is, among most civil nations, accounted the meanest and\r\nworst of all forms of government, and histories record that it hath\r\nalways been of least continuance and fullest of trouble.\"[62]\r\n\r\n  [62] Life of Winthrop, Vol. II., 427.\r\n\r\nThere was a doubt in the minds of many people, which we have often heard\r\nuttered in recent times, with reference to the French people in their\r\nlong series of revolutions, and equally so with the Spanish-American\r\nrepublics with their almost annual revolutions, whether these words of\r\nWinthrop were not correct, and that the people were really incapable of\r\nself-government. It was a doubt which the revolution did not silence,\r\nfor the disturbing elements which had their issue in the Shay Rebellion,\r\nThe Whiskey Insurrection and the mutiny of the Pennsylvania Line, in\r\n1781, were embers of a fire, smothered, not quenched, which rendered\r\nstate government insecure till it was welded into the Federal Union.\r\nThere was a widespread dislike to the levelling principles of New\r\nEngland, to the arrogant, restless and ambitious policy of its\r\ndemagogues; to their manifest desire to invent or discover grievances,\r\nfoment quarrels and keep the wound open and festering.[63]\r\n\r\n  [63] See Adams' Works, Vol. II, pp. 350, 410.\r\n\r\nThose who rebelled in good faith did so because they feared that the\r\npower of Parliament to tax them moderately to raise money for their own\r\ndefence might be used sometime in the future for a less worthy purpose,\r\nand then they would all be \"slaves.\" Their argument led to mob rule and\r\nanarchy, till the adaption of the Federal Constitution, after the close\r\nof the Revolutionary War.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of such an authority as Lecky on our revolutionary movements\r\nmust be worthy of thoughtful attention; and his opinion is this: \"Any\r\nnation might be proud of the shrewd, brave, prosperous and highly\r\nintelligent yeomen who flocked to the American camps; but they were very\r\ndifferent from those who defended the walls of Leyden, or immortalized\r\nthe field of Bannockburn. Few of the great pages of history are less\r\nmarked by the stamp of heroism than the American Revolution and perhaps\r\nthe most formidable of the difficulties which Washington had to\r\nencounter were in his own camp.\"[64] And he concludes his survey of the\r\nmovement with these words: \"In truth the American people, though in\r\ngeneral unbounded believers in progress, are accustomed, through a kind\r\nof curious modesty, to do themselves a great injustice by the\r\nextravagant manner in which they idealize their past. It has almost\r\nbecome as commonplace that the great nation which in our own day has\r\nshown such an admirable combination of courage, devotion and humanity in\r\nits gigantic Civil War, and which since that time has so signally\r\nfalsified the prediction of its enemies and put to shame all the nations\r\nof Europe by its unparalleled efforts in paying off its national debt,\r\nis of far lower moral type than its ancestors at the time of the War of\r\nIndependence. This belief appears to me essentially false. The nobility\r\nand beauty of Washington can, indeed, hardly be paralleled. Several of\r\nthe other leaders of the Revolution were men of ability and public\r\nspirit, and few armies have ever shown a nobler self-devotion than that\r\nwhich remained with Washington through the dreary winter at Valley\r\nForge. But the army that bore those sufferings was a very small one, and\r\nthe general aspect of the American people during the contest was far\r\nfrom heroic or sublime. The future destinies and greatness of the\r\nEnglish race must necessarily rest mainly with the mighty nation which\r\nhas arisen beyond the Atlantic, and that nation may well afford to admit\r\nthat its attitude during the brief period of its enmity to England has\r\nbeen very unduly extolled. At the same time, the historian of that\r\nperiod would do the Americans a great injustice if he judged them only\r\nby the revolutionary party, and failed to recognize how large a\r\nproportion of their best men had no sympathy with the movement.\"[65]\r\n\r\n  [64] Lecky, \"American Revolution,\" p. 230.\r\n\r\n  [65] Lecky's \"American Revolution,\" p. 375.\r\n\r\nOur native historians and the common run of Fourth of July orators have\r\ntreated their countrymen badly for a hundred years. They have given the\r\nworld to understand that we are the degenerate children of a race of\r\ngiants, statesmen, and moralists, who flourished for a few years about a\r\ncentury ago and then passed away. An impartial examination of the\r\nrecords would show that we are wiser, better, more benevolent, quite as\r\npatriotic and brave as the standard heroes of 1776. We may give our\r\nancestors credit for many admirable virtues without attempting to\r\nmaintain that a multitude of unlettered colonists, scattered along the\r\nAtlantic coast, hunting, fishing, smuggling, and tilling the soil for a\r\nslender livelihood, and fighting Indians and wild beasts to save their\r\nown lives, possessed a vast fund of political virtue and political\r\nintelligence, and left but little of either to their descendants. The\r\npublic is beginning to tire of this tirade of indiscriminate eulogy, and\r\nthe public taste is beginning to reject it as a form of defamation. And\r\nso the ripening judgment of our people is beginning to demand portraits\r\nof our ancestors painted according to the command that Cromwell gave the\r\nartist; to paint his features, warts, blotches, and all, and to demand\r\nan account of our forefathers in which we shall learn to speak of them\r\nas they were.\r\n\r\nSabine, in his valuable work, \"Loyalists of the American Revolution,\"\r\nsays: \"I presume that I am of Whig descent. My father's father received\r\nhis death-wound under Washington, at Trenton; my mother's father fought\r\nunder Stark at Bennington. I do not care, of all things, to be thought\r\nto want appreciation of those of my countrymen who broke the yoke of\r\ncolonial vassalage, nor on the other hand, do I care to imitate the\r\nwriters of a later school, and treat the great and the _successful_\r\nactors in the world's affairs as little short of divinities, and as\r\nexempt from criticism. Nay, this general statement will not serve my\r\npurpose. Justice demands as severe a judgment of the Whigs as of their\r\nopponents, and I shall here record the result of long and patient study.\r\nAt the Revolutionary period the principles of unbelief were diffused to\r\na considerable extent throughout the colonies. It is certain that\r\nseveral of the most conspicuous personages of those days were either\r\navowed disbelievers in Christianity, or cared so little about it that\r\nthey were commonly regarded as disciples of the English or French school\r\nof sceptical philosophy. Again, the Whigs were by no means exempt from\r\nthe lust of land hunger. Several of them were among the most noted land\r\nspeculators of their time, during the progress of the war, and, in a\r\nmanner hardly to be defended, we find them sequestering and\r\nappropriating to themselves the vast estates of those who opposed them.\r\nAvarice and rapacity were seemingly as common then as now. Indeed, the\r\nstock-jobbing, the extortion, the fore-stalling of the law, the arts and\r\ndevices to amass wealth which were practised during the struggle, are\r\nalmost incredible. Washington mourned the want of virtue as early as\r\n1775, and averred that he 'trembled at the prospect'--soldiers were\r\nstripped of their miserable pittance that contractors for the army might\r\nbecome rich in a single campaign. Many of the sellers of merchandise\r\nmonopolized (or 'cornered') articles of the first necessity, and would\r\nnot part with them to their suffering countrymen, and to the wives and\r\nchildren of those who were absent in the field, unless at enormous\r\nprofit. The traffic carried on with the army of the king was immense.\r\nMen of all descriptions finally engaged in it, and those who at the\r\nbeginning of the war would have shuddered at the idea of any connection\r\nwith the enemy, pursued it with increasing avidity. The public\r\nsecurities were often counterfeited, official signatures forged, and\r\nplunder and jobbery openly indulged in. Appeals to the guilty from the\r\npulpit, the press, and the halls of legislature were alike unheeded. The\r\ndecline of public spirit, the love of gain of those in office, the\r\nplotting of disaffected persons, and the malevolence of factions, became\r\nwidely spread, and in parts of the country were uncontrollable. The\r\nuseful occupations of life and the legitimate pursuits of commerce were\r\nabandoned by thousands. The basest of men enriched themselves, and many\r\nof the most estimable sank into obscurity and indigence. There were\r\nthose who would neither pay their debts nor their taxes. The indignation\r\nof Washington was freely expressed. 'It gives me sincere pleasure,' he\r\nsaid, in a letter to Joseph Reed, 'to find the Assembly is so well\r\ndisposed to second your endeavor in bringing those murderers of our\r\ncause to condign punishment. It is much to be lamented that each state,\r\nlong ere this, has not hunted them down as pests of society and the\r\ngreatest enemies we have to the happiness of America. No punishment, in\r\nmy opinion, is too great for the man who can build his greatness upon\r\nhis country's ruin.'\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to another, he drew this picture, which he solemnly declared\r\nto be a true one: \"From what I have seen, heard, and in part known,\"\r\nsaid he, \"I should in one word say, that idleness, dissipation, and\r\nextravagance seem to have laid fast hold on most; that speculation,\r\npeculation, and an insatiable thirst for riches, seem to have got the\r\nbetter of every other consideration, and almost every order of men, and\r\nthat party disputes and personal quarrels are the great business of the\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\nIn other letters he laments the laxity of public morals, the \"distressed\r\nrumors, and deplorable condition of affairs,\" the \"many melancholy\r\nproofs of the decay of private virtue.\" \"I am amazed,\" said Washington\r\nto Colonel Stewart, \"at the report you make of the quantity of provision\r\nthat goes daily into Philadelphia from the County of Bucks.\"\r\nPhiladelphia was occupied at that time by the British army, who paid in\r\nhard money and not in \"continental stuff.\" and mark you! this was\r\nwritten in January of that memorable winter which the American army\r\npassed in nakedness and starvation at Valley Forge. There was always an\r\narmy--on paper. At the close of one campaign there were not enough\r\ntroops in camp to man the lines. At the opening of another \"scarce any\r\nstate in the Union,\" as Washington said, had an \"eighth part of its\r\nquota\" in service. The bounty finally paid to soldiers was enormous. The\r\nprice for a single recruit was as high sometimes as seven hundred and\r\nfifty, and one thousand dollars, on enlistment for the war, besides the\r\nbounty and emoluments given by Congress. One hundred and fifty dollars\r\n\"in specie\" was exacted and paid for a term of duty of only five months.\r\nSuch were the extraordinary inducements necessary to tempt some men to\r\nserve their country when its vital interests were at issue. Making every\r\nallowance for the effects of hunger and want, for the claims of families\r\nat home, and for other circumstances equally imperative, desertion,\r\nmutiny, robbery, and murder are still high crimes. There were soldiers\r\nof the Revolution who deserted in parties of twenty and thirty at a\r\ntime, and several hundred of those who then abandoned the cause fled to\r\nVermont and were among the early settlers of that state. A thousand men,\r\nthe date of whose enlistment had been misplaced, perjured themselves in\r\na body, as fast as they could be sworn, in order to quit the ranks which\r\nthey had voluntarily entered. In smaller parties, hundreds of others\r\ndemanded dismissals from camp under false pretexts, and with lies upon\r\ntheir lips. Some also added treason to desertion, and joined the various\r\ncorps of Loyalists in the capacity of spies upon their former friends,\r\nor as guides and pioneers. Many more enlisted, deserted, and re-enlisted\r\nunder new recruiting officers for the purpose of receiving double\r\nbounty, while others who placed their names upon the rolls were paid the\r\nmoney to which they were entitled, but refused to join the army; and\r\nothers still who were sent to the hospitals returned home without leave\r\nafter their recovery, and were sheltered and secreted by friends and\r\nneighbors, whose sense of right was as weak as their own. Another class\r\nsold their clothing, provisions, and arms to obtain means of indulgence\r\nin revelry and drunkenness; while some prowled about the country to rob\r\nand kill the unoffending and defenceless. A guard was placed over the\r\ngrave of a foreigner of rank, who died in Washington's own quarters, and\r\nwho was buried in full dress, with diamond rings and buckles, \"lest the\r\nsoldiers should be tempted to dig for hidden treasure.\" Whippings,\r\ndrummings out of the service, and even military executions were more\r\nfrequent in the Revolution than at any subsequent period of our history.\r\n\r\nIf we turn our attention to the officers we shall find that many had but\r\ndoubtful claims to respect for purity of private character, and that\r\nsome were addicted to grave vices. There were officers who were\r\ndestitute alike of honor and patriotism, who unjustly clamored for their\r\npay, while they drew large sums of public money under pretext of paying\r\ntheir men, but applied them to the support of their own extravagance;\r\nwho went home on furlough and never returned to the army; and who,\r\nregardless of their word as gentlemen, violated their paroles, and were\r\nthreatened by Washington with exposure in every newspaper in the land as\r\nmen who had disgraced themselves and were heedless of their associates\r\nin captivity, whose restraints were increased by their misconduct. At\r\ntimes, courts-martial were continually sitting, and so numerous were the\r\nconvictions that the names of those who were cashiered were sent to\r\nCongress in long lists. \"Many of the surgeons\"--are the words of\r\nWashington--\"are very great rascals, countenancing the men to sham\r\ncomplaints to exempt them from duty, and often receiving bribes to\r\ncertify indisposition with a view to procure discharge or furlough\"; and\r\nstill further, they drew as for the public \"medicines and stores in the\r\nmost profuse and extravagant manner for private purposes.\" In a letter\r\nto the governor of a state, he affirmed that the officers who had been\r\nsent him therefrom were \"generally of the lowest class of the people,\"\r\nthat they \"led their soldiers to plunder the inhabitants and into every\r\nkind of mischief.\" To his brother, John Augustine Washington, he\r\ndeclared that the different states were nominating such officers as were\r\n\"not fit to be shoe-blacks.\" Resignations occurred upon discreditable\r\npretexts, and became alarmingly prevalent. Some resigned at critical\r\nmoments, and others combined together in considerable number for\r\npurposes of intimidation, and threatened to retire from the service at a\r\nspecified time unless certain terms were complied with. Many of those\r\nwho abandoned Washington were guilty of a crime which, when committed by\r\nprivate soldiers, is called \"desertion,\" and punished with death.\r\nEighteen of the generals retired during the struggle, one for\r\ndrunkenness, one to avoid disgrace for receiving double pay, some from\r\ndeclining health, others from weight of advancing years; but several\r\nfrom private resentments and real or imagined wrongs inflicted by\r\nCongress or associates in the service.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams wrote in 1777: \"I am worried to death with the wrangles\r\nbetween military officers, high and low. They quarrel like cats and\r\ndogs. They worry one another like mastiffs, scrambling for rank and pay\r\nlike apes for nuts.\"[66]\r\n\r\n  [66] Sabine, Vol. I, pp. 139-150.\r\n\r\n\"The abandoned and profligate part of our army,\" wrote Washington, \"lost\r\nto every sense of honor or virtue as well as their country's good, are\r\nby rapine and plunder spreading ruin and terror wherever they go,\r\nthereby making themselves infinitely more to be dreaded than the common\r\nenemy they are come to oppose. Under the idea of Tory property, or\r\nproperty that may fall into the hands of the enemy, no man is secure in\r\nhis effects, and scarcely in his person.\"[67] American soldiers were\r\nconstantly driving innocent persons out of their homes by an alarm of\r\nfire, or by actual incendiarism, in order more easily to plunder the\r\ncontents, and all attempts to check this atrocious practice had proved\r\nabortive. The burning of New York was generally attributed to New\r\nEngland soldiers. The efforts of the British soldiers to save the city\r\nwere remembered with gratitude, and there is little doubt that in the\r\ncity, and in the country around it, the British were looked upon not as\r\ninvaders, but as deliverers.\r\n\r\n  [67] Washington's Works, IV., 118, 119, Lecky, 257.\r\n\r\n\"Wherever the men of war have approached, our militia have most manfully\r\nturned their backs and run away, officers and men, like sturdy fellows,\r\nand these panics have sometimes seized the regular regiments.\r\n\r\n\"....You are told that a regiment of Yorkers behaved ill, and it may be\r\ntrue; but I can tell you that several regiments of Massachusetts men\r\nbehaved ill, too. The spirit of venality you mention is the most\r\ndreadful and alarming enemy America has to oppose. It is as rapacious\r\nand insatiable as the grave. This predominant avarice will ruin America.\r\nIf God Almighty does not interfere by His grace to control this\r\nuniversal idolatry to the mammon of unrighteousness, we shall be given\r\nup to the chastisement of His judgments. I am ashamed of the age I live\r\nin.\"[68]\r\n\r\n  [68] Letter of John Adams to His Wife, Vol. I., p. 171.\r\n\r\nNor was the public life of the country at that time more creditable. In\r\nthe course of the war, persons of small claims to notice or regard\r\nobtained seats in Congress. By force of party disruptions, as was\r\nbitterly remarked by one of the leaders, men were brought into the\r\nmanagement of affairs \"who might have lived till the millennium in\r\nsilent obscurity had they depended upon their mental qualifications.\"\r\nGouverneur Morris was, no doubt, one of the shrewdest observers of\r\ncurrent events in his day, and the purity of the patriotism of John Jay\r\nentitled him to stand by the side of Washington. One day, in a\r\nconversation, thirty years after the second Continental Congress had\r\npassed away, Morris exclaimed: \"Jay, what a set of damned scoundrels we\r\nhad in that second Congress!\" And Jay, as he knocked the ashes from his\r\npipe, replied: \"Yes, we had.\"\r\n\r\nNear the close of 1779, Congress, trying to dispel the fear that the\r\ncontinental currency would not be redeemed, passed a resolution\r\ndeclaring: \"A bankrupt, faithless republic would be a novelty in the\r\npolitical world. The pride of America revolts at the idea. Her citizens\r\nknow for what purpose these emissions were made, and have repeatedly\r\npledged their faith for the redemption of them.\" The rest of the\r\nresolution is too coarse for quotation, even for the sake of emphasis.\r\nIn a little more than three months from the passage of that resolution a\r\nbill was passed to refund the continental currency by issuing one dollar\r\nof new paper money for forty of the old, and the new issue soon became\r\nas worthless as the former emission. Indeed, the patriots repudiated\r\nobligations to the amount of two hundred million dollars, and did it so\r\neffectually that we still use the expression, \"not worth a continental\"\r\nas a synonym for worthlessness.\r\n\r\nIt is a common belief that scurrilous and indecent attacks upon public\r\nmen by American journalists is an evil of modern growth; but this is an\r\nerror. A century ago such attacks exceeded in virulence anything that\r\nwould be possible today. Among the vilest of the lampooners of that age\r\nwere a quartette of literary hacks who for some years were engaged in\r\ndenouncing the federalist party and government. Philip Freneau owned\r\n\"_The National Gazette_,\" a journal that Hamilton declared disclosed \"a\r\nserious design to subvert the government.\" He was among the most\r\nvirulent assailants of Washington's administration, denouncing not only\r\nthe members of the cabinet, except Jefferson, but the chief himself.\r\nAmong other charges brought against him, Washington was accused of\r\n\"debauching the country\" and \"seeking a crown,\" \"and all the while\r\npassing himself off as an honest man.\" Benjamin F. Bache was a grandson\r\nof Dr. Benjamin Franklin. He inherited all his ancestor's duplicity,\r\nlove of intrigue, and vindictiveness, but none of his suavity and tact.\r\nSullen and malevolent of disposition, scarcely could he keep in accord\r\nwith men of his own party. He owned and edited \"The Aurora,\" a paper\r\nwhich in depth of malice and meanness exceeded the journal of Freneau.\r\nHe also made vicious attacks upon Washington, both in the \"Aurora\" and\r\nother publications. Washington's \"fame\" he declared to be \"spurious\"; he\r\nwas \"inefficient,\" \"mischievous,\" \"treacherous,\" and \"ungrateful.\" His\r\n\"mazes of passion\" and the \"loathings of his sick mind\" were held up to\r\nthe contempt of the people. \"His sword,\" it was declared, \"would have\r\nbeen drawn against his country\" had the British government given him\r\npromotion in the army. He had, it was asserted, \"cankered the principles\r\nof republicanism\" \"and carried his designs against the public liberty so\r\nfar as to put in jeopardy its very existence.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Duane, a man of Irish parentage, assisted Bache in the conduct\r\nof the \"Aurora,\" and upon his death, in 1798, assumed full control of\r\nit. He was responsible for some of the most virulent attacks upon\r\nWashington, published in that paper. Bache and Duane both received\r\nsevere castigations, administered in retaliation for abusive articles.\r\n\r\nJames Thompson Callender, who disgraced Scotland by his birth, was a\r\nshameless and double-faced rascal. A professional lampooner, his pen was\r\nat the service of any one willing to pay the price. He, too, had a fling\r\nat the President, declaring that \"Mr. Washington had been twice a\r\ntraitor,\" and deprecating \"the vileness of the adulation\" paid him.\r\n\r\nIn this quartette of scoundrels may be added the notorious Thomas Paine,\r\nwho, after exalting Washington to the seventh heaven of excellence, upon\r\nbeing refused by him an office that to confer upon him would have\r\ndisgraced the nation, showered upon him the vilest denunciation. \"As for\r\nyou, sir,\" he wrote, addressing him, \"treacherous in private friendship,\r\nand a hypocrite in public life, the world will be puzzled to decide\r\nwhether you are an apostate or an impostor; whether you have abandoned\r\ngood principles, or whether you ever had any.\" That these attacks upon\r\nmembers of the government were the direct results of the teachings of\r\nJefferson there is no room for doubt. That he encouraged and supported\r\ntheir authors has been proved beyond a doubt. He was one of the worst\r\ndetractors of Great Britain. For fifty years he employed his pen in\r\nreviling the mother country. Then occurred one of the most remarkable\r\ninstances of political death-bed repentance that the annals of\r\nstatecraft have to show. He who had so often asserted that Great Britain\r\nwas a nation powerless, decrepit, lost to corruption, eternally hostile\r\nto liberty, totally destitute of morality and good faith, and warned his\r\ncountrymen to avoid intercourse with her lest they become contaminated\r\nby the touch; he who had yearned for her conquest by a military despot,\r\nand proposed to burn the habitations of her citizens, like the nests of\r\nnoxious vermin, is suddenly found proclaiming \"her mighty weight,\"\r\nlauding her as the protector of free government, and exhorting his\r\nfellow citizens to \"sedulously cherish a cordial friendship with her.\"\r\nThis change of heart was brought about by the announcement by Great\r\nBritain of the so-called \"Monroe Doctrine.\" In Jefferson's letter to\r\nMonroe of October 24, 1823, he said: \"The question presented by the\r\nletters you have sent me (the letters of Mr. Rush, reciting Mr.\r\nCanning's offer of British support against the attempt of the \"Holy\r\nAlliance\" to forcibly restore the revolted Spanish-American colonies to\r\nSpain), is the most momentous that has ever been offered to my\r\ncontemplation since that of Independence. And never could we embark\r\nunder circumstances more auspicious. By acceding to Great Britain's\r\nproposition we detach her from the bonds, bring her mighty weight into\r\nthe scale of free government, and emancipate a continent at one stroke.\r\nWith her on our side we need not fear the whole world. With her then we\r\nshould most sedulously cherish a cordial friendship.\"\r\n\r\nAlexander Hamilton was a soldier of fortune of the highest type. He was\r\nborn on the island of Nevis, in the West Indies. He was of illegitimate\r\nbirth; his father was Scotch and his mother French. Endowed with a high\r\norder of intellect, possessed of indomitable energy and passionate\r\nambition, he went forth into the world determined to win both.[69]\r\nChance threw him into the colonies at a time when the agitation for\r\nindependence was at its height. He landed at Boston in October, 1772;\r\nthence he went to New York, where in his sixteenth year he entered\r\nKing's (now Columbia) College. At first he affiliated with the\r\nLoyalists, but soon deserted to the Disunionists, which gave him greater\r\nopportunities of realizing his ambitious dream. As a Loyalist the world\r\nwould never have heard of him, but as John Marshall informs us, he ranks\r\nnext to Washington as having rendered more conspicuous service to the\r\nUnited States than any other man in the Revolution. A great orator, a\r\ntalented lawyer, a good soldier, master of every field he entered,\r\npunctilious and haughty of temperament, he scorned to bend even to the\r\nproud spirit of Washington. His position on Washington's staff was\r\nliterally a secretaryship more civil than military. It was \"the\r\ngrovelling condition of a clerk,\" which his youthful genius revolted at.\r\nThis caused him to resign his staff appointment. Alexander Hamilton was\r\nthe deviser and establisher of the government of the United States. He\r\nit was that framed the Constitution, who urged and secured its adoption\r\nby the original thirteen states at a time when but a rope of sand bound\r\nthem together. To Hamilton, more than any other man, is due the fact\r\nthat the United States today form a nation. He lived long enough to see\r\nthe nation to which he gave political stability submitting itself in\r\nentire respect and confidence to the declaration contained in the most\r\nremarkable document ever written.\r\n\r\n  [69] In a letter written by Hamilton when he was but thirteen years of\r\n  age, employed as a clerk, he declared: \"I condemn the grovelling\r\n  condition of a clerk to which my future condition condemns me, and would\r\n  willingly risk my life, though not my character, to exalt my station.\"\r\n\r\nLike many of his contemporaries he was an _intrigaunt_, injuring his\r\nhealth and impairing the sanctity of his home, and was destined to meet\r\nhis death at the hands of a man more dissolute than himself, and\r\ndestitute of his honorable traits of character.\r\n\r\nProfessor Sumner says: \"It is astonishing how far writers kept from the\r\nfacts and evidence. This is so much the case that it is often impossible\r\nto learn what was really the matter. The colonists first objected to\r\ninternal taxes, but consented to import duties. Then they distinguished\r\nbetween import duties to regulate commerce, and import duties for\r\nrevenue. They seem to have changed their position and to be consistent\r\nin one thing only, to pay no taxes and to rebel.\" After patiently\r\nexamining their pamphlets and discussions, Sumner concludes: \"The\r\nincidents of the trouble offer occasion at every step for reserve in\r\napproving the proceedings of the colonists. We therefore come to the\r\nconclusion that the Revolutionary leader made a dispute about the method\r\nof raising a small amount of revenue a pretext for rending an empire\r\nwhich, if united, might civilize and wisely govern the fairest portion\r\nof the globe.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing statements are more than corroborated by a letter written\r\nto Washington by Rev. Jacob Duche, a former rector of Christ Church,\r\nPhiladelphia, a man of great learning, eloquence, and piety, who was\r\nappointed chaplain to the first Congress. His prayer at the opening of\r\nthe session was pronounced not only eloquent, but patriotic in the\r\nextreme. While it was being uttered there was but one man in that whole\r\nassembly who knelt, and that man was George Washington. When Washington\r\nreceived the letter he immediately transmitted it to Congress. The\r\nletter was in part as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                         Philadelphia, 8th October, 1777.\r\n\r\n\"Sir--If this letter should find you in council or in the field, before\r\nyou read another sentence I beg you to take the first opportunity of\r\nretiring and weighing its important contents. You are perfectly\r\nacquainted with the part I formerly took in the present unhappy contest.\r\nI was, indeed, among the first to bear my public testimony against\r\nhaving any recourse to threats, or indulging a thought of an armed\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\n\"The current, however, was too strong for my feeble efforts to resist. I\r\nwished to follow my countrymen as far only as virtue and the\r\nrighteousness of their cause would permit me. I was, however, prevailed\r\non, among the rest of my clerical brethren of this city, to gratify the\r\npressing desires of my fellow citizens by preaching a sermon, and\r\nreluctantly consented. From a personal attachment of nearly twenty\r\nyears' standing and a high respect for your character, in private as\r\nwell as public life, I took the liberty of dedicating this sermon to\r\nyou. I had your affectionate thanks for my performance in a letter,\r\nwherein was expressed, in the most delicate and obliging terms, your\r\nregard for me, and your wishes for a continuance of my friendship and\r\napprobation of your conduct. Further than this I intended not to\r\nproceed. My sermon speaks for itself, and wholly disclaims the idea of\r\nindependence. My sentiments were well known to my friends. I\r\ncommunicated them without reserve to many respectable members of\r\nCongress, who expressed their warm approbation of it then. I persisted\r\nto the very last moment to use the prayers for my Sovereign, though\r\nthreatened with insults from the violence of a party.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the declaration of independence I called my vestry and solemnly\r\nput the question to them whether they thought it best for the peace and\r\nwelfare of the congregation to shut up the churches, or to continue the\r\nservice without using the prayers for the Royal Family. This was the sad\r\nalternative. I concluded to abide by their decision, as I could not have\r\ntime to consult my spiritual superiors in England. They determined it\r\nmost expedient, under such critical circumstances, to keep open the\r\nchurches that the congregations might not be dispersed, which we had\r\ngreat reason to apprehend.\r\n\r\n\"A very few days after the fatal declaration of independence I received\r\na letter from Mr. Hancock, sent by express to Germantown, where my\r\nfamily were for the summer season, acquainting me I was appointed\r\nChaplain to the Congress, and desired my attendance next morning at nine\r\no'clock. Surprised and distressed as I was by an event I was not\r\nprepared to expect, obliged to give an immediate attendance without the\r\nopportunity of consulting my friends, I easily accepted the appointment.\r\nI could have but one motive for taking this step. I thought the churches\r\nin danger, and hoped by this means to have been instrumental in\r\npreventing those ills I had so much reason to apprehend. I can, however,\r\nwith truth declare I then looked upon independence rather as an\r\nexpedient, and hazardous, or, indeed, thrown out in _terrorem_, in order\r\nto procure some favorable terms, than a measure that was seriously\r\npersisted in. My sudden change of conduct will clearly evince this to\r\nhave been my idea of the matter.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the return of the Committee of Congress appointed to confer with\r\nLord Howe I soon discerned their whole intentions. The different\r\naccounts which each member gave of this conference, the time they took\r\nto make up the matter for public view, and the amazing disagreements\r\nbetween the newspaper accounts, and the relation I myself had from the\r\nmouth of one of the Committee, convinced me there must have been some\r\nunfair and ungenerous procedure. This determination to treat on no other\r\nstrain than that of independence, which put it out of his lordship's\r\npower to mention any terms at all, was sufficient proof to me that\r\nindependence was the idol they had long wished to set up, and that\r\nrather than sacrifice this they would deluge their country with blood.\r\nFrom this moment I determined upon my resignation, and in the beginning\r\nof October, 1776, sent it in form to Mr. Hancock, after having\r\nofficiated only two months and three weeks; and from that time, as far\r\nas my safety would permit, I have been opposed to all their measures.\r\n\r\n\"This circumstantial account of my conduct I think due to the friendship\r\nyou were so obliging as to express for me, and I hope will be sufficient\r\nto justify my seeming inconsistencies in the part I have acted.\r\n\r\n\"And now, dear sir, suffer me in the language of truth and real\r\naffection to address myself to you. All the world must be convinced you\r\nare engaged in the service of your country from motives perfectly\r\ndisinterested. You risked everything that was dear to you, abandoned the\r\nsweets of domestic life which your affluent fortune can give the\r\nuninterrupted enjoyment of. But had you, could you have had, the least\r\nidea of matters being carried to such a dangerous extremity? Your most\r\nintimate friends shuddered at the thought of a separation from the\r\nmother country, and I took it for granted that your sentiments coincided\r\nwith theirs. What, then, can be the consequences of this rash and\r\nviolent measure and degeneracy of representation, confusion of councils,\r\nblunders without number? The most respectable characters have withdrawn\r\nthemselves, and are succeeded by a great majority of illiberal and\r\nviolent men. Take an impartial view of the present Congress, and what\r\ncan you expect from them? Your feelings must be greatly hurt by the\r\nrepresentation of your native province. You have no longer a Randolph, a\r\nBland or a Braxton, men whose names will ever be revered, whose demands\r\nnever ran above the first ground on which they set out, and whose truly\r\nglorious and virtuous sentiments I have frequently heard with rapture\r\nfrom their own lips. Oh, my dear sir, what a sad contrast of characters\r\nnow presents! others whose friends can ne'er mingle with your own. Your\r\nHarrison alone remains, and he disgusted with the unworthy associates.\r\n\r\n\"As to those of my own province, some of them are so obscure that their\r\nvery names were never in my ears before, and others have only been\r\ndistinguished for the weakness of their undertakings and the violence of\r\ntheir tempers. One alone I except from the general charge; a man of\r\nvirtue, dragged reluctantly into their measures, and restrained by some\r\nfalse ideas of honor from retreating after having gone too far. You\r\ncannot be at a loss to discover whose name answers to this character.\r\n\r\n\"From the New England provinces can you find one that as a gentleman you\r\ncould wish to associate with, unless the soft and mild address of Mr.\r\nHancock can atone for his want of every other qualification necessary\r\nfor the seat which he fills? Bankrupts, attorneys, and men of desperate\r\nfortunes are his colleagues. Maryland no longer sends a Tilghman and a\r\nCarroll. Carolina has lost her Lynch, and the elder Middleton has\r\nretired. Are the dregs of Congress, then, still to influence a mind like\r\nyours? These are not the men you engaged to serve; these are not the men\r\nthat America has chosen to represent her. Most of them were chosen by a\r\nlittle, low faction, and the few gentlemen that are among them now are\r\nwell known to lie on the balance, and looking up to your hand alone to\r\nturn the beam. 'Tis you, sir, and you only, that supports the present\r\nCongress; of this you must be fully sensible. Long before they left\r\nPhiladelphia their dignity and consequence were gone; what must it be\r\nnow since their precipitate retreat? I write with freedom, but without\r\ninvective. I know these things to be true, and I write to one whose own\r\nobservation must have convinced him that it is so.\r\n\r\n\"After this view of the Congress, turn to the army. The whole world\r\nknows that its only existence depends upon you, that your death or\r\ncaptivity disperses it in a moment, and that there is not a man on that\r\nside--the question in America--capable of succeeding you. As to the army\r\nitself, what have you to expect from them? Have they not frequently\r\nabandoned you yourself in the hour of extremity? Can you have the least\r\nconfidence in a set of undisciplined men and officers, many of whom have\r\nbeen taken from the lowliest of the people, without principle, without\r\ncourage? Take away them that surround your person, how very few there\r\nare you can ask to sit at your table! As to your little navy, of that\r\nlittle what is left? Of the Delaware fleet part are taken, and the rest\r\nmust soon surrender. Of those in the other provinces some are taken, one\r\nor two at sea, and others lying unmanned and unrigged in your harbors.\r\n\r\n\"In America your harbors are blocked up, your cities fall one after\r\nanother; fortress after fortress, battle after battle is lost. A British\r\narmy, after having passed unmolested through a vast extent of country,\r\nhave possessed themselves of the Capital of America. How unequal the\r\ncontest! How fruitless the expense of blood! Under so many discouraging\r\ncircumstances, can virtue, can honor, can the love of your country\r\nprompt you to proceed? Humanity itself, and sure humanity is no stranger\r\nto your breast, calls upon you to desist. Your army must perish for want\r\nof common necessaries or thousands of innocent families must perish to\r\nsupport them; wherever they encamp, the country must be impoverished;\r\nwherever they march, the troops of Britain will pursue, and must\r\ncomplete the destruction which America herself has begun. Perhaps it may\r\nbe said, it is better to die than to be made slaves. This, indeed, is a\r\nsplendid maxim in theory, and perhaps in some instances may be found\r\nexperimentally true; but when there is the least probability of a happy\r\naccommodation, surely, wisdom and humanity call for some sacrifices to\r\nbe made to prevent inevitable destruction. You well know there is but\r\none invincible bar to such an accommodation; could this be removed,\r\nother obstacles might readily be removed. It is to you and you alone\r\nyour bleeding country looks and calls aloud for this sacrifice. Your arm\r\nalone has strength sufficient to remove this bar. May Heaven inspire you\r\nwith this glorious resolution of exerting your strength at this crisis,\r\nand immortalizing yourself as friend and guardian to your country! Your\r\npenetrating eye needs not more explicit language to discern my meaning.\r\nWith that prudence and delicacy, therefore, of which I know you\r\npossessed, represent to Congress the indispensable necessity of\r\nrescinding the hasty and ill-advised declaration of independence.\r\nRecommend, and you have an undoubted right to recommend, an immediate\r\ncessation of hostilities. Let the controversy be taken up where that\r\ndeclaration left it, and where Lord Howe certainly expected to find it\r\nleft. Let men of clear and impartial characters, in or out of Congress,\r\nliberal in their sentiments, heretofore independent in their\r\nfortunes--and some such may be found in America--be appointed to confer\r\nwith His Majesty's Commissioners. Let them, if they please, propose some\r\nwell-digested constitutional plan to lay before them at the commencement\r\nof the negotiation. When they have gone thus far I am confident the\r\nusual happy consequences will ensue--unanimity will immediately take\r\nplace through the different provinces, thousands who are now ardently\r\nwishing and praying for such a measure will step forth and declare\r\nthemselves the zealous advocates for constitutional liberty, and\r\nmillions will bless the hero that left the field of war to decide this\r\nmost important contest with the weapons of wisdom and humanity.\r\n\r\n\"O sir, let no false ideas of worldly honor deter you from engaging in\r\nso glorious a task! Whatever censure may be thrown out by mean,\r\nilliberal minds, your character will rise in the estimation of the\r\nvirtuous and noble. It will appear with lustre in the annals of history,\r\nand form a glorious contrast to that of those who have fought to obtain\r\nconquest and gratify their own ambition by the destruction of their\r\nspecies and the ruin of their country. Be assured, sir, that I write not\r\nthis under the eye of any British officer or person connected with the\r\nBritish army or ministry. The sentiments I express are the real\r\nsentiments of my own heart, such as I have long held, and which I should\r\nhave made known to you by letter before had I not fully expected an\r\nopportunity of a private conference. When you passed through\r\nPhiladelphia on your way to Wilmington I was confined by a severe fit of\r\nthe gravel to my chamber; I have since continued much indisposed, and\r\ntimes have been so very distressing that I had neither spirit to write a\r\nletter nor an opportunity to convey it when written, nor do I yet know\r\nby what means I shall get these sheets to your hands.\r\n\r\n\"I would fain hope that I have said nothing by which your delicacy can\r\nbe in the least hurt. If I have, I assure you it has been without the\r\nleast intention, and therefore your candor will lead you to forgive me.\r\nI have spoken freely of Congress and of the army; but what I have said\r\nis partly from my own knowledge and partly from the information of some\r\nrespectable members of the former and some of the best officers of the\r\nlatter. I would not offend the meanest person upon earth; what I say to\r\nyou I say in confidence to answer what I cannot but deem a most\r\n_valuable purpose_. I love my country; I love you; but to the love of\r\ntruth, the love of peace, and the love of God, I hope I should be\r\nenabled if called upon to the trial to sacrifice every other inferior\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n\"If the arguments made use of in this letter should have so much\r\ninfluence as to engage you in the glorious work which I have warmly\r\nrecommended, I shall ever deem my success the highest temporal favor\r\nthat Providence could grant me. Your interposition and advice I am\r\nconfident would meet with a favorable reception from the authority under\r\nwhich you act.\r\n\r\n\"If it should not, you have an infallible recourse still left--negotiate\r\nfor your country at the head of your army. After all, it may appear\r\npresumption as an individual to address himself to you on a subject of\r\nsuch magnitude, or to say what measures would best secure the interest\r\nand welfare of a whole continent. The friendly and favorable opinion you\r\nhave always expressed for me emboldens me to undertake it, and which has\r\ngreatly added to the weight of this motive. I have been strongly\r\nimpressed with a sense of duty upon the occasion, which left my\r\nconscience uneasy and my heart afflicted till I fully discharged it. I\r\nam no enthusiast; the course is new and singular to me; but I could not\r\nenjoy one moment's peace till this letter was written. With the most\r\nardent prayers for your spiritual as well as temporal welfare, I am your\r\nmost obedient and humble friend and servant,\r\n\r\n                                                         Jacob Duche.\"\r\n\r\nThe estimation in which Mr. Duche was held before he wrote this letter,\r\nby John Adams, who was not particularly friendly to Episcopalians, who\r\nas a class were Loyalists (although Washington was one), is here shown.\r\nAdams says: \"Mr. Duche is one of the most ingenuous men, and of best\r\ncharacter, and greatest orator in the Episcopal order upon this\r\ncontinent; yet a zealous friend of liberty and his country.\"[70]\r\n\r\n  [70] Letters of John Adams to His Wife, Vol. I., p. 24.\r\n\r\nIn the cold light of truth it now seems quite clear that Americans took\r\nup arms before they were in any real danger of oppression, and George\r\nIII. was persuaded to concede more than all their reasonable demands,\r\nbut yielded too late to save the integrity of the empire.\r\n\r\nWe are taught in many of our histories that George III. was a tyrant,\r\nseeking to establish despotism, and that Washington rescued and\r\npreserved Anglo-Saxon liberty, not only in America, but wherever it\r\nexisted in the British domains; but this is too extravagant a compliment\r\nto the king. We may admit that he was a respectable man in private life,\r\nthat he acted on principle, as he understood it, in his public career,\r\nand that he had some princely accomplishments, but was far from a great\r\nman. Certainly he was not in the class of conqueror, nor was he able to\r\ncommit \"a splendid crime.\" His mother was ever croaking in his ears:\r\n\"George, be a king!\" Thackeray gives us a touching account of the king's\r\nlast years. All history, he tells us, presents no sadder picture. It is\r\ntoo terrible for tears. Driven from his throne, buffeted by rude hands,\r\nhis children in revolt, his ending was as pitiful and awful as that of\r\nKing Lear. In a lucid moment the Queen entered his room and found him\r\nsinging and playing on a musical instrument. When he had finished he\r\nknelt and prayed for her and for his family, and for the nation, and\r\nlast for himself. And then tears began to flow down his cheeks, and his\r\nreason fled again. Caesar, Henry VIII., and Napoleon tried to establish\r\na dynasty of despots, and failed. As we glance at the figure of George\r\nIII. and recall the traits of his character, we see that Anglo-Saxon\r\ncivilization or liberty was in no danger of permanent injury from the\r\nlast king of England who tried to reign.\r\n\r\nAs we review the conflict we are apt to forget that the Americans were\r\nnot alone in their efforts to throw off the restraint of law and\r\nauthority of the government during the twenty years preceding the\r\nsurrender at Yorktown; Wilkes, \"Junius,\" and Lord George Gordon\r\nsurpassed the efforts of Patrick Henry, Sam Adams, and Crispus Attucks,\r\nto make life unpleasant for King George. Mobs surged about the streets\r\nof London as they did in Boston, defying the law, destroying property,\r\nand disturbing the public peace. The house of Lord Mansfield, chief\r\njustice of England, was wrecked and burned to the ground in the same\r\nmanner as the home of Thomas Hutchinson, chief justice of Massachusetts,\r\nwas wrecked and pillaged. Both mobs claimed to act \"on principle,\" and\r\nthere is a curious likeness in the details of these two acts of\r\nviolence. It was an age of insurrection, with no political genius able,\r\nor in a position, to direct the storm. During the Wilkes riots, in 1768,\r\nthe civil power in England was reduced to extreme weakness. Lecky tells\r\nus \"there were great fears that all the bulwarks of order would yield to\r\nthe strain,\" and Franklin, then in London, said that if Wilkes had\r\npossessed a good character and the king a bad one, Wilkes would have\r\ndriven George III. from the throne. In 1780, during the Gordon riots,\r\nchaos came again to London, and all England was threatened with anarchy.\r\nThe time was out of joint on both continents, and George III. was not\r\nborn to set it right. We may be sure there is something more serious\r\nthan glory in all this turmoil that embittered the most beneficent of\r\ncivilizing races. Whoever examines the dispute with impartial care, will\r\nprobably perceive that the time had come for a new adjustment of the\r\nconstitutional relations of the several parts of the British Empire, but\r\nthe temper of George III. and the disorderly elements, active both in\r\nEngland and America, were unfavorable to rational treatment of the great\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nEarly in the Revolution it was considered necessary, in order to insure\r\nits success, to obtain aid and recognition from the French.\r\n\r\nMr. Silas Deane, of Connecticut, and three agents, were sent to France\r\nto feel the pulse of the king and nation upon the subject. They,\r\nhowever, neither acknowledged the agents nor directed them to leave the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nIt was not so with individuals, among whom was M. Beaumarchais, who, on\r\nhis own account and credit, furnished the United States with twenty\r\nthousand stand of arms and one thousand barrels of powder of one hundred\r\npounds weight each. Ten thousand of the muskets were landed at\r\nPortsmouth, N. H., and the remainder in some southern State. The first\r\nopportunity of testing the qualities of the new French muskets occurred\r\nSeptember 19, 1777, which engagement led up to the battle of Saratoga\r\nOctober 7, which terminated in the convention with Burgoyne October 17,\r\n1777. Major Caleb Stark, the eldest son of Gen. John Stark, who was\r\npresent in these actions, says: \"I firmly believe that unless these arms\r\nhad been thus timely furnished to the Americans, Burgoyne would have\r\nmade an easy march to Albany. What then? My pen almost refuses to record\r\nthe fact that these arms have never been paid for to this day. When the\r\nwar ended, application was made to Congress for payment, which was\r\nrefused on the frivolous pretext that they were a present from the\r\nFrench king. The claim was referred to the United States\r\nattorney-general, who reported in substance that he could find no\r\nevidence of their having been paid for, or that they were presented as a\r\ngift by the court of France.\r\n\r\n\"Supposing the most favorable plea of Congress to be true, that there\r\nwas an underhand connivance by France to furnish the arms, or the king\r\nhad thought proper to deny it, is it just or magnanimous for the United\r\nStates to refuse payment? Suppose the arms were clearly a 'gift'\r\nbestowed upon us in our poverty, ought not a high-minded people to\r\nrestore the value of that gift with ten-fold interest, when their\r\nbenevolent friend has become poor, and they have waxed wealthy and\r\nstrong?\r\n\r\n\"Congress, skulking behind their sovereignty, still refused payment. Yet\r\nthe cries of Beaumarchais, reduced to poverty by the French Revolution,\r\nhave not been heeded.\"[71]\r\n\r\n  [71] Memoir of Gen. John Stark, by his son Caleb Stark, pp. 356-7-8.\r\n\r\nThe action of Congress concerning the Saratoga Convention was equally\r\nbase. The whole number of prisoners surrendered by Burgoyne was 5791.\r\nThe force of the Americans was, according to a statement which Gates\r\nfurnished to Burgoyne, 13,222. The terms of the Convention was that\r\nBurgoyne's troops were to march out of their camp with all the honors of\r\nwar, the artillery to be moved to the banks of the Hudson, and there to\r\nbe left, together with the soldiers' arms; that a free passage should be\r\ngranted the troops to Great Britain, on condition of their not serving\r\nagain during the war; that the army should march to the neighborhood of\r\nBoston by the most expeditious and convenient route, and not delayed\r\nwhen transport should arrive to receive them; that every care should be\r\ntaken for the proper subsistence of the troops till they should be\r\nembarked. Although Congress ratified the terms of the Convention entered\r\ninto by General Burgoyne and Gates, yet they violated them in the most\r\nperfidious manner. Many Americans now regard this as the most\r\ndisgraceful act ever perpetrated by the United States. There was not the\r\nslightest excuse for this treachery. When the British ministry charged\r\nCongress with positive perfidy, Congress added insult to injury by\r\ncharging the ministry with \"meditated perfidy,\" for they \"believed the\r\nBritish would break their parole if released.\" After the arrival of the\r\ntroops at Boston they were quartered at Cambridge, where they were\r\nsubjected to the most cruel and inhuman treatment. Officers and soldiers\r\nwere shot down and bayoneted in the most cold-blooded manner without the\r\nslightest provocation. If the officers resented any insults, they were\r\nsent to Worcester and treated as felons. They were charged the most\r\nexorbitant prices for food. Burgoyne alone was allowed to go home on\r\nparole; all the other officers and men were marched into the interior of\r\nVirginia, where they were kept in confinement for five years.[72]\r\n\r\n  [72] \"Travels Through the Interior Parts of America,\" by Thomas Aubury.\r\n\r\nThere is probably not one American in a thousand that knows the origin\r\nand meaning of Washington's advice to his countrymen against entering\r\ninto \"entangling foreign alliances,\" and the often quoted phrase:\r\n\"French Spoliation Claims,\" and yet the two are inseparably connected,\r\nand form a most important phase in the early history of the United\r\nStates. American historians have passed over this episode, fearing that\r\nit would bring odium on the \"Fathers of the Revolution.\" By the treaty\r\nmade by Franklin with France, in which she recognized the United States\r\nand by which means American independence was secured, it was agreed that\r\nthe United States should assist France in foreign complications in which\r\nshe might be involved, and furthermore to protect her possessions in the\r\nWest Indies. This was the first treaty made by the United States. When\r\nthe time came for putting these pledges into force, the United States\r\nrefused to act.\r\n\r\n\"The expense of the war of the Revolution was as much, if not more, to\r\nFrance, than to the United States, and it is a matter of historical\r\ntruth that the expenses incurred in this war by France bankrupted the\r\nnation and hurried on the terrible events which convulsed the world from\r\nthe commencement of the French Revolution until the battle of Waterloo.\r\nDuring all this distress and disaster, the Americans were chuckling in\r\ntheir sleeves, and wasting the treasures of the old world to embellish\r\nthe half-fledged cities of the new world. Gratitude is a virtue often\r\nspoken of with apparent sincerity, but not so frequently exhibited in\r\npractice.\" This is the language of a well-known Revolutionary\r\nofficer.[73] Therefore, the United States acted in a most shameful and\r\ndisgraceful manner in violating the first treaty she ever entered into,\r\nthrough which she secured her independence; she did not give the French\r\nthat assistance she had agreed to give by treaty, but remained neutral\r\nand indifferent, while England seized upon the larger part of the French\r\ncolonies in the West Indies. The base ingratitude of the United States\r\nexasperated the French, so they issued orders to seize and destroy\r\nAmerican property wherever found. Several naval engagements between the\r\nlate allies ensued, and 898 vessels were seized by the French government\r\nor were destroyed by its cruisers, prior to the year 1800. Hence, when\r\nEllsworth, Van Murray and Davie, the commissioners appointed by the\r\nUnited States to negotiate with France, and to settle the dispute, asked\r\nfor damages for the seizure and destruction of American vessels, the\r\nFrench foreign minister turned upon them with the assertion that in\r\nperforming her part of the Franklin treaty of 1778, France had spent\r\n$28,000,000, and had sacrificed the lives of thousands of her people,\r\nsimply for the purpose of gaining the independence for the United\r\nStates. All it had asked had been the friendship and assistance of the\r\nUnited States in the manner provided in this treaty. Instead of meeting\r\nthese claims and requiting the generosity of France in the way such\r\nconduct deserved, the United States had ignored its obligations, and now\r\ncame forward and advanced a petty claim for money, utterly forgetful of\r\nhow much France had sacrificed in its behalf.\r\n\r\n  [73] \"Letter of Major Caleb Stark in Memoir of General John Stark,\" p.\r\n  364.\r\n\r\nAs might be supposed, there was no answer that could be made to this\r\nassertion, and hence the new treaty then drawn up, in which the two\r\nstates agreed to renounce respectively whatever pretensions they might\r\nhave had to claims one against the other, was ratified by the Senate,\r\nand promulgated by President Jefferson December 21, 1801, thus\r\nrelieving France of all responsibility for damages caused by her\r\ncruisers prior to 1800, and throwing the responsibility of liquidating\r\nthese demands upon the United States government--a responsibility it\r\nsucceeded in avoiding for a hundred years, as it succeeded in avoiding\r\nthe demands which the French government could and did make upon it to\r\ndefend French West India possessions. These were the \"entangling foreign\r\nalliances\" referred to by Washington.\r\n\r\nBills granting payment of these claims, which originally amounted to\r\n$12,676,000, passed Congress twice, and were vetoed first by President\r\nPolk and then by President Pierce. If ever there was a just claim\r\nbrought before Congress, these French spoliation claims deserve the\r\ntitle, and it is a historical disgrace to the government of the United\r\nStates that the payment of them was delayed for nearly a hundred\r\nyears.[74]\r\n\r\n  [74] During Cleveland's administrations a bill was passed allowing\r\n  claimants to present claims for adjudication to the amount of their face\r\n  value. If interest was added, they would exceed $100,000,000. The owners\r\n  of the 898 vessels destroyed, who were called upon to make this\r\n  sacrifice as a means of relieving the government from a great\r\n  responsibility, in many cases were reduced to poverty by the duplicity\r\n  of the government, and even now with this scant justice, there are many\r\n  that find it very difficult to prove their claim, so long a time has\r\n  elapsed, and many are dead without legal representation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n_INDIANS IN THE REVOLUTION._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writers of American histories severely condemn the British\r\ngovernment for employing Indians in the war of the Revolution as well as\r\nin 1812, and give unstinted praise to the Americans for humanity in\r\nrefusing to make use of the warlike but undisciplined and cruel Indian\r\nas an ally in the activities of a military campaign. Either an attempt\r\nis made to suppress the whole truth of this matter, or the writers have\r\nfailed in their duty to thoroughly investigate sources of history easily\r\naccessible to the honest historian.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that in the incipient stage of the Revolutionary war,\r\novertures were made by the political disturbers and leading instigators\r\nof trouble to win over to the side of the American party the fiercest,\r\nif not the most numerous Indian nation on the North American continent.\r\n\r\nFrom Concord, on the fourth of April, 1775, the Provincial Congress\r\nthought fit, with cunning prudence, to address the sachem of the\r\nMohawks, with the rest of the Iroquois tribes, in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"Brother, they have made a law to establish the religion of the pope in\r\nCanada, which lies near you. We much fear some of your children may be\r\ninduced, instead of worshipping the only true God, to pay his due to\r\nimages, made with their own hands.\"[75]\r\n\r\n  [75] American Archives, series I, p. 1350.\r\n\r\nHere, then, a religious reason was advanced, in lieu of the real one,\r\nwhy the Indians should oppose the British, by whom they had always been\r\ngenerously treated. The response to the insinuating address was not\r\nencouraging. May it not be assumed that these Indians had already\r\nexperienced some of the same kind of love, generosity and good faith, as\r\nlater every tribe has received from every government at Washington, from\r\nthe days of the first president to the latest, through the past \"century\r\nof dishonor.\"\r\n\r\n_Before the 19th of April_, the Provincial Congress had authorized the\r\nenlistment of a company of Stockbridge (Massachusetts) Indians. These\r\nIndians were used by the Americans during the siege of Boston. A letter,\r\ndated July 9, 1775, says: \"Yesterday afternoon some barges were sounding\r\nthe Charles River near its mouth, but were soon obliged to row off by\r\nour Indians, fifty in number, who are encamped near that place.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLONEL MIFFLEN'S INTERVIEW WITH THE CAUGINAWAGA INDIANS.\r\n\r\nAt Watertown during the seige of Boston, the Revolutionists endeavored\r\nto obtain their assistance.]\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of June, two of the Indians killed four of the regulars with\r\ntheir bows and arrows, and plundered them. Frothingham says the\r\nBritish complained, and with reason, of their mode of warfare.\r\n\r\nLieut. Carter, writes July 2, 1775: \"Never had the British army so\r\nungenerous an enemy to oppose. They send their riflemen, five or six at\r\na time, who conceal themselves behind trees, etc., till an opportunity\r\npresents itself of taking a shot at our advanced sentries, which done,\r\nthey immediately retreat.\"[76]\r\n\r\n  [76] American Archives. Series I, p. 1350.\r\n\r\nDuring the siege of Boston, John Adams visited Washington's camp at\r\nWatertown, and wrote the following letter to his wife, which goes to\r\nprove the efforts made by the Americans to enlist the Canadian Indians\r\nin their cause, and which they afterwards complained so bitterly of the\r\nBritish for doing:\r\n\r\n                                         \"Watertown, 24 January, 1776.\r\n\r\n\"I dined at Colonel Mifflin's with the general and lady, and a vast\r\ncollection of other company, among whom were six or seven sachems and\r\nwarriors of the French Caughnawaga Indians, with several of their wives\r\nand children. A savage feast they made of it, yet were very polite in\r\nthe Indian style. One of the sachems is an Englishman, a native of this\r\ncolony, whose name was Williams, captivated in infancy, with his mother,\r\nand adopted by some kind squaw.\"[77]\r\n\r\n  [77] Frothingham Siege of Boston, p. 212. Letters of John Adams to his\r\n  Wife Vol. I., p. 79.\r\n\r\nMany attempts were made by the Americans to use the Indians. Montgomery\r\nmade use of them in his Canadian expedition.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1776, Washington wrote to Congress, urging their employment in\r\nthe army, and reported on July 13th that, without special authority, he\r\nhad directed General Schuyler to engage the Six Nations on the best\r\nterms he and his colleagues could procure, and again submitting the\r\npropriety of engaging the Eastern Indians. John Adams thought \"we need\r\nnot be so delicate as to refuse the assistance of Indians, provided we\r\ncannot keep them neutral.\" A treaty was exchanged with the Eastern\r\nIndians on July 17, 1776, whereby they agreed to furnish six hundred for\r\na regiment, which was to be officered by the whites. As a result of\r\nthis, the Massachusetts Council subsequently reported that seven\r\nPenobscot Indians--all that could be procured--were enlisted in October\r\nfor one year.[78] It is interesting to remember, in this connection,\r\nthat the courteous and chivalrous Lafayette raised a troop of Indians to\r\nfight the British and the Tories, though his reputation has been saved\r\nby the utter and almost ludicrous failure of his attempt.[79]\r\n\r\n  [78] Windsor Nar. and Crit. His. Vol. VI., 655, 657.\r\n\r\n  [79] Essays in American History, 178.\r\n\r\nWhen all this had been done, it needed the forgetfulness and the blind\r\nhypocrisy of passion to denounce the king to the world for having\r\n\"endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless\r\nIndian savage.\" Yet Americans have never had the self-respect to erase\r\nthis charge from a document generally printed in the fore-front of the\r\nConstitution and Laws, and with which every schoolboy is sedulously made\r\nfamiliar.\r\n\r\nThe Revolutionists failed to enlist the Indians in their cause, for the\r\nIndian and the Colonist were bitter and irreconcilable foes. The Indian\r\nhad long scores to pay, not upon the English nation or the English army,\r\nbut upon the American settler who had stolen his lands, shot his sons,\r\nand debauched his daughters. It is well here to remember the speech of\r\nLogan, the Cayuga chief, on the occasion of the signing of the treaty of\r\npeace in 1764, at the close of the Pontiac Conspiracy. Logan said: \"I\r\nappeal to any white man to say if ever he entered Logan's cabin hungry\r\nand he gave him not meat; if ever he came cold and naked and he clothed\r\nhim not. Such was my love of the white man that my countrymen in passing\r\nmy cabin said: 'Logan is the friend of the white man.' I have even\r\nthought to have lived with you but for the injuries you did me last\r\nspring, when in cold blood and unprovoked, you murdered all the\r\nrelations of Logan, not sparing even my women and children. There runs\r\nnot a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called\r\nfor revenge. I have sought it. I have killed many. I have fully glutted\r\nmy vengeance.\" Logan's family, being on a visit to a family of the name\r\nof Greathouse, was murdered by them and their associates under\r\ncircumstances of great brutality and cowardice. It is known that in\r\nrevenge, Logan took over 30 scalps with his own hand. And others than\r\nIndians had old scores to wipe out. Many loyalists who desired to be\r\nleft alone in peace had been tarred and feathered by their former\r\nfriends and fellow-townsmen; were driven from their homes and hunted\r\nlike wild beasts; imprisoned, maimed, and compelled to suffer every kind\r\nof indignity. In many cases fathers, brothers and sons were hanged,\r\nbecause they insisted on remaining loyal to their country. Therefore it\r\nis not to be wondered at that many of these loyalists sought a terrible\r\nrevenge against those who had maltreated them. If the loyalists of New\r\nYork, Georgia and the Carolinas resolved to join the Indians and wreak\r\nvengeance on their fellow countrymen at Wyoming and Cherry Valley, and\r\nto take part in the raids of Tyron and Arnold, there was a rude cause\r\nfor their retaliating. Their actions have been held up to the execration\r\nof posterity as being exceptionally barbarous, and as far surpassing in\r\ncruelty the provocative actions of the revolutionists, Sullivan's\r\ncampaign through the Indian country being conveniently forgotten. There\r\nwas not much to choose between a cowboy and a skinner, and very little\r\ndifference between Major Ferguson's command and that of Marion and\r\nSumpter. There were no more orderly or better behaved troops in either\r\narmy than Simcoe's Queen's Rangers. There can be no doubt that the\r\naction of the loyalists have been grossly exaggerated, or at least dwelt\r\nupon as dreadful scenes of depravity, to form a background for the\r\nheroism and fortitude of the \"patriotic\" party whose misdeeds are passed\r\nlightly over. The methods of the growth of popular mythology have been\r\nthe same in America as in Greece or Rome. The gods of one party have\r\nbecome the devils of the other. The haze of distance has thrown a halo\r\naround the American leaders--softening outlines, obscuring faults, while\r\nthose of the British and the loyalists have grown with the advanced\r\nyears.[80]\r\n\r\n  [80] Essays in American History, 176, 177.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARTOON ILLUSTRATING FRANKLIN'S DIABOLICAL SCALP STORY.\r\n\r\nFrom an old print in the possession of the Bostonian Society.]\r\n\r\nThe following brief entry in a diary, will show that among the American\r\nforces savage customs found place: \"On Monday, the 30th, sent out a\r\nparty for some dead Indians. Toward morning found them, and skinned two\r\nof them from their hips down, for boot legs; one pair for the major, the\r\nother for myself.\"[81]\r\n\r\n  [81] Proceedings, N. J. His. Soc. II, 31.\r\n\r\nIt has been the policy of American historians and their echoes in\r\nEngland to bring disrepute upon the Indians and the British government\r\nwho employed them, and not only to magnify actual occurrences, but\r\nsometimes, when facts were wanting, to draw upon imagination for such\r\ndeeds of ferocity and bloodshed as might serve to keep alive the\r\nstrongest feelings of indignation against the mother country, and thus\r\ninfluence men to take the field for revenge who had not already been\r\ndriven thither by the impulse of their sense of patriotism. Dr. Franklin\r\nhimself did not think it unworthy of his antecedents and position to\r\nemploy these methods to bring disrepute on the British. The \"deliberate\r\nfiction for political purposes,\" by Franklin, were written as facts.\r\nNever before was there such diabolical fiction written as his well known\r\nscalp story, long believed and recently revived in several books\r\npurporting to be \"authentic history.\" The details were so minute and\r\nvaried as to create a belief that they were entirely true. For a century\r\nsupposed to be authentic, it has since been ascertained to be a\r\npublication from the pen of Dr. Franklin for political purposes. It\r\ndescribes minutely the capture from the Seneca Indians of eight bales of\r\nscalps, which were being sent the governor of Canada, to be forwarded by\r\nhim as a gift to the \"Great King.\" The description of the contents of\r\neach bale was given with such an air of plausibility as to preclude a\r\nsuspicion that it was fictitious. The following are a few brief\r\nabstracts from this story: \"No. 1 contains forty-three scalps of\r\nCongress soldiers, also sixty-two farmers, killed in their houses in the\r\nnight time. No. 2 contains ninety-eight farmers killed in their houses\r\nin the day time. No. 3 contains ninety-seven farmers killed in the\r\nfields in the day time. No. 4 contains 102 farmers, mixed, 18 burnt\r\nalive, after being scalped; sixty-seven being greyheads, and one\r\nclergyman. No. 5 containing eighty-eight scalps of woman's hair,\r\nlong-braided in Indian fashion. No. 6 containing 193 boys' scalps of\r\nvarious ages. No. 7, 211 girls' scalps, big and little. No. 8, this\r\npackage is a mixture of all the varieties above mentioned, to the number\r\nof 122, with a box of birch bark, containing twenty-nine infants' scalps\r\nof various sizes.\"[82]\r\n\r\n  [82] Life of Brandt. Appendix No. 1, Vol. I.\r\n\r\nWith the bales of scalps was a speech addressed to the \"Great King.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most cruel and bloodthirsty acts of the Americans was the\r\nmassacre of the Moravian Indians. \"From love of peace they had advised\r\nthose of their own color who were bent on war to desist from it. They\r\nwere also led from humanity, to inform the white people of their danger,\r\nwhen they knew their settlements were about to be invaded. One hundred\r\nand sixty Americans crossed the Ohio and put to death these harmless,\r\ninoffensive people, though they made no resistance. In conformity with\r\ntheir religious principles these Moravians submitted to their hard fate\r\nwithout attempting to destroy their murderers. Upward of ninety of these\r\npacific people were killed by men who, while they called themselves\r\nChristians, were more deserving of the names of savages than were their\r\nunresisting victims.\"[83]\r\n\r\n  [83] Dr. Ramsay's His. U. S., Vol. II., Chapter XIX, pp. 330, 332.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n_THE EXPULSION OF THE LOYALISTS AND THE SETTLEMENT OF CANADA._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Huguenots and the proscribed of the French Revolution found\r\nsanctuary as welcome guests in England and the English colonies.\r\n\r\nThe Moors were well treated when banished from Spain; the Revocation of\r\nthe Edict of Nantes was civil death to all Huguenots; the Americans made\r\nthe treaty of peace of 1783 worse than civil death to all Loyalists.\r\n\r\nThe Americans, at the inception and birth of their republic, violated\r\nevery precept of Christianity and of a boasted civilization, even to\r\nconfiscating the estates of helpless women. For all time it is to be a\r\npart of American history that the last decade of the eighteenth century\r\nsaw the most cruel and vindictive acts of spoliation recorded in modern\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nAt the treaty of peace, 1783, the banishment and extermination of the\r\nLoyalists was a foregone conclusion. The bitterest words ever uttered by\r\nWashington were in reference to them: \"He could see nothing better for\r\nthem than to recommend suicide.\" Neither Congress nor state governments\r\nmade any recommendation that humane treatment should be meted out to\r\nthese Loyalists. John Adams had written from Amsterdam that he would\r\n\"have hanged his own brother had he taken part against him.\"[84]\r\n\r\n  [84] Address to the \"United Empire Loyalists,\" by Edward Harris,\r\n  Toronto, 1897.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the war the mob were allowed to commit any outrage or\r\natrocity, while the authorities in each state remained apparently\r\nindifferent. An example of Loyalist ill-treatment is to be found in a\r\nletter written October 22, 1783, to a Boston friend, and preserved in\r\nNew York City manual, 1870:--\r\n\r\n\"The British are leaving New York every day, and last week there came\r\none of the d----d refugees from New York to a place called Wall Kill, in\r\norder to make a tarry with his parents, where he was taken into custody\r\nimmediately. His head and eyebrows were shaved, tarred and feathered, a\r\nhog-yoke put on his neck, and a cowbell thereon; upon his head a very\r\nhigh hat and feathers were set, well plumed with tar, and a sheet of\r\npaper in front with a man drawn with two faces, representing the traitor\r\nArnold and the devil.\"\r\n\r\nSome American writers have been extremely severe upon Americans who\r\nserved in the royal armies. Such condemnation is certainly illogical and\r\nunjust. They must have reasoned they were fighting to save their\r\ncountry from mob rule, from the domination of demagogues and traitors,\r\nand to preserve to it what, until then, all had agreed to be the\r\ngreatest of blessings, the connection with Great Britain, the privilege\r\nof being Englishmen, heirs of all the free institutions which were\r\nembodied in a \"great and glorious constitution.\" If the Loyalists\r\nreasoned in this manner, we cannot blame them, unless we are ready to\r\nmaintain the proposition that the cause of every revolution is\r\nnecessarily so sacred that those who do not sympathize with it should\r\nabstain from opposing it.\r\n\r\nVery early in the Revolution the disunionists tried to drive the\r\nLoyalists into the rebel militia or into the Continental army by fines,\r\nand by obliging them to hire substitutes. The families of men who had\r\nfled from the country to escape implication in the impending war were\r\nobliged to hire substitutes, and they were fined for the misdeeds of the\r\nmercenary whom they had engaged. Fines were even imposed upon neutral\r\nand unoffending persons for not preventing their families from entering\r\nthe British service. If the fines were refused, the property was\r\nrecklessly sold to the amount of the fine and costs of action. Loyalists\r\nconvicted of entering the enemy's lines could be fined as high as 2000\r\npounds, and even the unsuccessful attempt to enter might be punished by\r\na fine of 1000 pounds.[85] If the property of the offender failed to\r\nanswer for his offence, he became subject to corporal punishment,\r\nwhipping, branding, cropping of ears, and exposure in the pillory being\r\nresorted to in some of the states.\r\n\r\n  [85] \"Acts of New Jersey,\" Oct. 8, 1778, p. 60.\r\n\r\nThe Disunionists had early a covetous eye upon the property of the\r\nLoyalists. The legislative bodies hastened to pass such laws as would\r\nprevent those suspected of Loyalism from transferring their property,\r\nreal or personal, by real or pretended sale. Friends who tried to guard\r\nthe property of refugees nailed up the doors that led to the room\r\ncontaining valuable furniture, but were obliged by bullying committeemen\r\nto remove their barricades and give up their treasures.\r\n\r\nThe members of one wealthy refugee's family were reduced in their\r\nhousekeeping to broken chairs and teacups, and to dipping the water out\r\nof an iron skillet into a pot, which they did as cheerfully as if they\r\nwere using a silver urn. The furniture had been removed, though the\r\nfamily picture still hung in the blue room, and the harpsichord stood in\r\nthe passage way to be abused by the children who passed through. These\r\ntwo aristocratic ladies were obliged to use their coach-house as a\r\ndining-room, and the \"fowl-house\" as their bed chamber. The picture\r\ncontinues: \"In character the old lady looks as majestic even there, and\r\ndresses with as much elegance as if she were in a palace.\"[86] This\r\nmansion was General Putnam's headquarters at the battle of Bunker Hill,\r\nand was afterward confiscated.\r\n\r\n  [86] James Murray, Loyalist, p. 245, 253.\r\n\r\nWhen the treaty of peace was signed, the question of amnesty and\r\ncompensation for the Loyalists was long and bitterly discussed. Even\r\nthe French minister had urged it. John Adams, one of the commission,\r\nfavored compensating \"the wretches, how little soever they deserved it,\r\nnay, how much soever they deserve the contrary.\"[87]\r\n\r\n  [87] John Adams' Works, Vol. IX., p. 516.\r\n\r\nThe commission hesitated \"to saddle\" America with the Loyalists because\r\nthey feared the opposition at home, especially by the individual states.\r\nThe British demand had been finally met with the mere promise that\r\nCongress would recommend to the states a conciliatory policy with\r\nreference to the Loyalists. This solution neither satisfied the\r\nLoyalists nor the more chivalrous Englishmen. They declared that the\r\nprovision concerning the Loyalists was \"precipitate, impolitic,\" and\r\ncruelly neglectful of their American friends.[88] But all of this\r\ncavilling was unreasonable and hasty, for England had gotten for the\r\nLoyalists the utmost attainable in the treaty, and later proved\r\nhonorable and generous in the highest degree by compensating the\r\nLoyalists out of her own treasury--an act only excelled in the next\r\ncentury by the purchase and emancipation of all the slaves in the\r\nBritish Empire, for which the people of Great Britain taxed only\r\nthemselves--the most generous act ever performed by any nation in the\r\nhistory of mankind.\r\n\r\n  [88] Stevens' \"Facsimiles,\" 1054.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the recommendation of Congress which had been made in\r\naccordance with the terms of the treaty, confiscation still went on\r\nactively. Governors of the states were urged to exchange lists of\r\nproscribed persons, that no Loyalists might find a resting-place in the\r\nUnited States, and in every state they were disfranchised, while in many\r\nlocalities they were tarred and feathered, driven from town and warned\r\nnever to return again. Some were murdered and maltreated in the most\r\nhorrible manner. Thousands of inconspicuous Loyalists did, nevertheless,\r\nsucceed in remaining in the larger cities, where their identity was\r\nlost, and they were not the objects of jealous social and political\r\nexclusion as in the small town. In some localities where they were in\r\nthe majority, the hostile minority was not able to wreak its vengeance.\r\n\r\nWith the treaty of peace there came a rush for British American\r\nterritory. The numbers were increased in Canada to some 25,000 during\r\nthe next few years, and those in Nova Scotia and other British territory\r\nswelled the number to 60,000.\r\n\r\nMost of these exiles became, in one way or another, a temporary expense\r\nto the British government, and the burden was borne honorably and\r\nungrudgingly. The care began during the war. The Loyalists who aided\r\nBurgoyne were provided with homes in Canada, and before the close of\r\n1779 nearly a thousand refugees were cared for in houses and barracks\r\nand given fuel, household furniture, and even pensioned with money.\r\nAfter the peace, thousands of exiles at once turned to the British\r\ngovernment for temporary support. The vast majority had lost but little,\r\nand asked only for land and supplies to start life with. The minority\r\nwho had lost lands, offices and incomes, demanded indemnity. As for the\r\nmembers of the humbler class, the government ordered that there should\r\nbe given 500 acres of land to heads of families, 300 acres to single\r\nmen, and each township in the new settlements was to have 2000 acres for\r\nchurch purposes and 1000 for schools. Building material and tools, an\r\naxe, spade, hoe and plow, were furnished each head of a family. Even\r\nclothing and food were issued to the needy, and as late as 1785 there\r\nwere 26,000 entitled to rations. Communities were equipped with\r\ngrindstones and the machinery for grist and saw mills. In this way\r\n$5,000,000 were spent to get Nova Scotia well started, and in Upper\r\nCanada, besides the three million acres given to the Loyalist, some\r\n$4,000,000 were expended for this benefit before 1787.\r\n\r\nBut there was a far greater burden assumed by the British government in\r\ngranting the compensation asked for by those who had sacrificed\r\neverything to their loyalty. Those who had lost offices or professional\r\npractice were, in many cases, cared for by the gift of lucrative offices\r\nunder the government, and Loyalist military officers were put on half\r\npay. It is said with truth that the defeated government dealt with the\r\nexiled and fugitive Loyalists with a far greater liberality than the\r\nUnited States bestowed upon their victorious army.\r\n\r\nAfter the peace, over five thousand Loyalists submitted claims for\r\nlosses, usually through agents appointed by the refugees from each\r\nAmerican colony. In July of 1783, a commission of five members was\r\nappointed by Parliament to classify the losses and services of the\r\nLoyalists. They examined the claims with an impartial and judicial\r\nseverity. The claimant entered the room alone with the commissioners\r\nand, after telling his services and losses, was rigidly questioned\r\nconcerning fellow claimants as well as himself. The claimant then\r\nsubmitted a written and sworn statement of his losses. After the results\r\nof both examinations were critically scrutinized, the judges made the\r\naward. In the whole course of their work, they examined claims to the\r\namount of forty million of dollars, and ordered nineteen millions to be\r\npaid.\r\n\r\nIf to the cost of establishing the Loyalists in Nova Scotia and Canada\r\nwe add the compensation granted in money, the total amount expended by\r\nthe British government for their American adherents was at least thirty\r\nmillion dollars. There is evidence that the greatest care that human\r\ningenuity could devise was exercised to make all these awards in a fair\r\nand equitable manner. The members of the commission were of\r\nunimpeachable honesty. Nevertheless there was much complaint by the\r\nLoyalists because of the partial failure of giving the loyal exiles a\r\nnew start in life. The task was no easy one--to transfer a disheartened\r\npeople to a strange land and a trying climate, and let them begin life\r\nanew. But when, years later, they had made of the land of this exile a\r\nmighty member of the British empire, they began to glory in the days of\r\ntrial through which they had passed.\r\n\r\nAt a council meeting held at Quebec, November 9, 1789, an order was\r\npassed for \"preserving a register of the Loyalists that had adhered to\r\nthe unity of the empire, and joined the Royal Standard previous to the\r\ntreaty of peace in 1783, to the end that their posterity may be\r\ndistinguished from future settlers in the rank, registers, and rolls of\r\nthe militia of their respective districts, as proper objects for\r\npreserving and showing the fidelity and conduct so honorable to their\r\nancestors for distinguished benefit and privileges.\"\r\n\r\nToday their descendants are organized as the United Empire Loyalists,\r\nand count it an honor that their ancestors suffered persecution and\r\nexile rather than yield the principle and idea of union with Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the Loyalists failed, but their stand was a natural one and\r\nwas just and noble. They were the prosperous and contended men--the men\r\nwithout a grievance. Conservatism was the only policy that one could\r\nexpect of them. Men do not rebel to rid themselves of prosperity.\r\nProsperous men seek to conceive prosperity. The Loyalist obeyed his\r\nnature, but as events proved, chose the ill-fated cause, and when the\r\nstruggle ended, his prosperity had fled, and he was an outcast and an\r\nexile.\r\n\r\nIf, when George III. and his government recognized the independence of\r\nthe thirteen colonies, the Loyalists had been permitted to remain here\r\nand become, if they would, American citizens, the probabilities are\r\nthat, long before this time, an expansion would have taken place in the\r\nnational domain which would have brought under its control the entire\r\nAmerican continent north of the United States, an extension brought\r\nabout in an entirely peaceful and satisfactory manner. The method of\r\nexclusion adopted peopled Canada, so far as its English-speaking\r\ninhabitants were concerned, with those who went from the United States\r\nas political exiles, and who carried with them to their new homes an\r\never-burning sense of personal wrong and a bitter hatred of those who\r\nhad abused them.\r\n\r\nThe indifference shown to treaty obligations by Congress and the states,\r\nand the secret determination to eradicate everything British from the\r\ncountry, is now known to have been the deliberate, well-considered\r\npolicy of the founders of the Republic.\r\n\r\nThis old legacy of wrongdoing has been a barrier in the way of a\r\nhealthful northern development of the United States. The contentions\r\nwhich gave rise to these hostile feelings have been forgotten, but the\r\nfeelings themselves have long outlived the causes which gave rise to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n_THE WAR OF 1812 AND THE ATTEMPTED CONQUEST OF CANADA._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Revolutionary War had ended came the long twenty-three years'\r\nwar in which Great Britain, for the most part, single-handed, fought for\r\nthe freedom of Europe against the most colossal tyranny ever devised by\r\na victorious general. No nation in the history of the world carried on a\r\nwar so stubborn, so desperate, so costly, so vital. Had Great Britain\r\nfailed, what would now be the position of the world? At the very time\r\nwhen Britain's need was the sorest, when every ship, every soldier and\r\nsailor that she could find was needed to break down the power of the man\r\nwho had subjugated all Europe except Russia and Great Britain, the\r\nUnited States, the land of boasted liberty, did her best to cripple the\r\nliberating armies by proclaiming war against Britain in the hour of her\r\nsorest need.\r\n\r\nNapoleon was at the height of his power, with an army collected at\r\nBoulogne for the invasion of England. England was growing exhausted by\r\nthe contest. Her great Prime Minister, Pitt, had died broken hearted.\r\nEvery indication was favorable to the conquest of Canada by the United\r\nStates and therewith the extinction of all British interests on the\r\nwestern continent.\r\n\r\nIn the motherland it seemed, to the popular imagination, that on the\r\nother side of the Atlantic lived an implacable enemy, whose rancor was\r\ngreater than their boasted love of liberty. Fisher Ames, who was\r\nregarded by his party as its wisest counsellor and chief ornament,\r\nexpresses this general feeling on their part in a letter to Mr. Quincy,\r\ndated Dedham, Dec. 6, 1807, in which he says: \"Our cabinet takes council\r\nof the mob, and it is now a question whether hatred of Great Britain and\r\nthe reproach fixed even upon violent men, if they will not proceed in\r\ntheir violence, will not overcome the fears of the maritime states, and\r\nof the planters in Congress. The usual levity of a democracy has not\r\nappeared in regard to Great Britain. We have been steady in our hatred\r\nof her, and when popular passions are not worn out by time, but\r\nargument, they must, I should think, explode in war.\"[89]\r\n\r\n  [89] Life of Josiah Quincy, p. 119.\r\n\r\nThe action of the United States in declaring war against Great Britain\r\nwhen she was most sorely pressed in righting for the liberty of mankind\r\nis best set forth in the famous speech of Josiah Quincy, delivered\r\nbefore Congress on the 5th of January, 1813. It was, as he himself says\r\nof it, \"most direct, pointed and searching as to the motive and conduct\r\nof our rulers. It exposed openly and without reserve or fear the\r\niniquity of the proposed invasion of Canada. I was sparing of neither\r\nlanguage nor illustration.\" Its author, on reading it over in his old\r\nage, might well say that \"he shrunk not from the judgment of after\r\ntimes.\" Its invective is keen, its sarcasm bitter, its denunciations\r\nheavy and severe, but the facts from which they derive their sting or\r\ntheir weight are clearly stated and sustained.\r\n\r\nAs a means of carrying on the war, he denounces the invasion of Canada\r\nas \"cruel, wanton, senseless, and wicked--an attempt to compel the\r\nmother country to our terms by laying waste an innocent province which\r\nhad never injured us, but had long been connected with us by habits of\r\ngood neighborhood and mutual good offices.\" He said \"that the\r\nembarrassment of our relations with Great Britain and the keeping alive\r\nbetween this country and that of a root of bitterness has been, is, and\r\nwill continue to be, a main principle of the policy of this American\r\nCabinet.\"\r\n\r\nThe Democratic Party having attained power by fostering the old grudge\r\nagainst England, and having maintained itself in power by force of that\r\nantipathy, a consent to the declaration of war had been extorted from\r\nthe reluctant Madison as the condition precedent of his nomination for a\r\nsecond term of office.\r\n\r\nWhen war against Great Britain was proposed at the last session, there\r\nwere thousands in these United States, and I confess to you I was myself\r\namong the number, who believed not one word of the matter, I put my\r\ntrust in the old-fashioned notions of common sense and common prudence.\r\nThat a people which had been more than twenty years at peace should\r\nenter upon hostilities against a people which had been twenty years at\r\nwar, the idea seemed so absurd that I never once entertained it as\r\npossible. It is easy enough to make an excuse for any purpose. When a\r\nvictim is destined to be immolated, every hedge presents sticks for the\r\nsacrifice. The lamb that stands at the mouth of the stream will always\r\ntrouble the water if you take the account of the wolf who stands at the\r\nsource of it. We have heard great lamentation about the disgrace of our\r\narms on the frontier. Why, sir, the disgrace of our arms on the frontier\r\nis terrestrial glory in comparison with the disgrace of the attempt. Mr.\r\nSpeaker, when I contemplate the character and consequences of this\r\ninvasion of Canada, when I reflect on its criminality and its danger to\r\nthe peace and liberty of this once happy country, I thank the great\r\nAuthor and Source of all virtue that, through His grace, that section of\r\ncountry in which I have the happiness to reside, is in so great a degree\r\nfree from the iniquity of this transgression. I speak it with pride. The\r\npeople of that section have done what they could to vindicate themselves\r\nand their children from the burden of their sin.\r\n\r\nSurely if any nation had a claim for liberal treatment from another, it\r\nwas the British nation from the American. After the discovery of the\r\nerror of the American government in relation to the repeal of the Berlin\r\nand Milan Decrees in November, 1810, they had declared war against her\r\non the supposition that she had refused to repeal her orders in council\r\nafter the French Decrees were in fact revoked, whereas it now appears\r\nthat they were in fact not revoked. Surely the knowledge of this error\r\nwas followed by an instant and anxious desire to redress the resulting\r\ninjury. No, sir, nothing occurred. On the contrary the question of\r\nimpressment is made the basis of continuing the war. They renewed\r\nhostilities. They rushed upon Canada. Nothing would satisfy them but\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nI know, Mr. Speaker, that while I utter these things, a thousand tongues\r\nand a thousand pens are preparing without doors to overwhelm me, if\r\npossible, by their pestiferous gall. Already I hear in the air the sound\r\nof \"Traitor,\" \"British Agent,\" \"British Gold!\" and all those changes of\r\ncalumny by which the imagination of the mass of men are affected and by\r\nwhich they are prevented from listening to what is true and receiving\r\nwhat is reasonable.[90]\r\n\r\n  [90] Life of Josiah Quincy, pp. 256, 280, 281, 282, 283, 286, 287, 288,\r\n  289, 291.\r\n\r\nAs will be noticed in the foregoing extract from Josiah Quincy's\r\ncelebrated speech, New England refused to take any part in the war. In\r\nfact, it must be said in their favor that they refused absolutely to\r\nsend any troops to aid in the invasion of Canada. They regarded the\r\npretexts on which the war had been declared with contemptuous\r\nincredulity, believing them to be but thin disguises of its real object.\r\nThat object they believed to be the gratification of the malignant\r\nhatred the slave-holding states bore toward communities of free and\r\nintelligent labor, by the destruction of their wealth and prosperity.\r\n\r\nA town meeting was held in Boston at Faneuil Hall on June 11, 1812, at\r\nwhich it was \"Resolved: That in the opinion of this town, it is of the\r\nlast importance to the interest of this country to avert the threatened\r\ncalamity of war with Great Britain,\" etc. A committee of twelve was\r\nappointed to take into consideration the present alarming state of our\r\npublic affairs, and report what measures, in their opinion, it is proper\r\nfor the town to adopt at this momentous crisis.\r\n\r\nThe committee reported in part as follows: \"While the temper and views\r\nof the national administration are intent upon war, an expression of the\r\nsense of this town, will of itself be quite ineffectual either to avert\r\nthis deplorable calamity or to accelerate a return of peace, but\r\nbelieving as we do that an immense majority of the people are invincibly\r\naverse from conflict equally unnecessary and menacing ruin to themselves\r\nand their posterity, convinced as we are that the event will overwhelm\r\nthem with astonishment and dismay, we cannot but trust that a general\r\nexpression of the voice of the people would satisfy Congress that those\r\nof their representatives who had voted in favor of war, have not truly\r\nrepresented the wishes of their constituents, and thus arrest the\r\ntendency of their measures to this extremity.\"\r\n\r\nHad the policy of government been inclined towards resistance to the\r\npretentions of the belligerants by open war, there could be neither\r\npolicy, reason or justice in singling out Great Britain as the\r\nexclusive object of hostility. If the object of war is merely to\r\nvindicate our honor, why is it not declared against the first aggressor?\r\nIf the object is defense and success, why is it to be waged against the\r\nadversary most able to annoy and least likely to yield? Why, at the\r\nmoment when England explicitly declares her order in council repealed\r\nwhenever France shall rescind her decrees, is the one selected for an\r\nenemy and the other courted as a conqueror? \"Under present circumstances\r\nthere will be no scope for valor, no field for enterprise, no chance for\r\nsuccess, no hope of national glory, no prospect but of a war against\r\nGreat Britain, in aid of the common enemy of the human race, and in the\r\nend an inglorious peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe resolution recommended by the committee was adopted and it was voted\r\nthat the selectmen be requested to transmit a copy thereof to each town\r\nin this commonwealth.\r\n\r\nAt a town meeting held August 6, 1812, the following resolutions were\r\npassed: \"That the inhabitants of the town of Boston have learned with\r\nheartfelt concern that in the City of Baltimore a most outrageous\r\nattack, the result of deliberate combinations has been made upon the\r\nfreedom of opinion and the liberty of the press. An infuriated mob has\r\nsucceeded in accomplishing its sanguinary purpose by the destruction of\r\nprinting presses and other property, by violating the sanctuary of\r\ndwelling houses, breaking open the public prison and dragging forth from\r\nthe protection of civil authority the victims of their ferocious\r\npursuit, guilty of no crime but the expression of their opinions and\r\ncompleting the tissue of their enormities by curses, wounds and murders,\r\naccompanied by the most barbarous and shocking indignities.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the circumstances attending the origin, the progress, and the\r\ncatastrophe of this bloody scene, we discern with painful emotion, not\r\nmerely an aggravation of the calamities of the present unjust and\r\nruinous war, but a prelude to the dissolution of all free government,\r\nand the establishing of a reign of terror. Mobs, by reducing men to a\r\nstate of nature, defeat the object of every social compact. The sober\r\ncitizen who trembles in beholding the fury of the mob, seeks refuge from\r\nits dangers by joining in its acclamations. The laws are silenced. New\r\nobjects of violence are discovered. The government of the nation and the\r\nmob government change places with each other. The mob erects its horrid\r\ncrest over the ruins of liberty, of property, of the domestic relations\r\nof life and of civil institutions.\"[91]\r\n\r\n  [91] Boston Town Records, City Document No. 115, pp. 317, 318, 319, 320,\r\n  321, 322.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is a fair example of the feelings shown in New England\r\ntowards this unjustifiable war, and which culminated in the famous\r\nHartford convention which was accused of designing an organized\r\nresistance to the general government, and a separation of the New\r\nEngland states from the Union if the war was not stopped. The\r\nresolutions condemning the Baltimore mob also show the change in public\r\nopinion that had taken place in Boston during the thirty-seven years\r\nthat had elapsed since the commencement of the Revolution in Boston,\r\nwhich was inaugurated by mob violence, participated in by many who, by\r\nthe strange irony of fate, by these resolutions condemned their own\r\nactions.\r\n\r\nMr. Quincy did not stand alone among his countrymen of that day in a\r\ngeneral championship of Great Britain in the hour of her extremity. The\r\nReverend John Sylvester, John Gardner, rector of Trinity church, Boston,\r\na man of great scholarship, among others lifted up his voice in protest\r\nagainst unfair treatment of Great Britain by the government and people\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nIn a sermon at this time he said: \"Though submissive and even servile to\r\nFrance, to Great Britain we are eager to display our hatred and hurl our\r\ndefiance. Every petty dispute which may happen between an American\r\ncaptain and a British officer is magnified into a national insult. The\r\nland of our fathers, whence is derived the best blood of the nation, the\r\ncountry to which we are chiefly indebted for our laws and knowledge is\r\nstigmatized as a nest of pirates, plunderers and assassins. We entice\r\naway her seamen, the very sinews of her power.\r\n\r\n\"We refuse to restore them on application; we issue hostile\r\nproclamations; we interdict her ships of war from the common rights to\r\nhospitality; we have non-importation acts; we lay embargoes; we refuse\r\nto ratify a treaty in which she has made great concessions to us; we\r\ndismiss her envoy of peace who came purposely to apologize for an act\r\nunauthorized by her government; we commit every act of hostility against\r\nher in proportion to our means and station. Observe the conduct of the\r\ntwo nations and our strange conduct. France robs us and we love her;\r\nBritain courts us and we hate her.\"\r\n\r\nIt was during the summer of 1812, when Jefferson truly stated that every\r\ncontinental power of importance, except Russia, was allied with\r\nNapoleon, and Great Britain stood alone to oppose them, for Russia could\r\nnot aid her if she would--her commerce paralyzed, her factories closed,\r\ncommerce and her people threatened with famine. It was at this moment of\r\ndire extremity that Madison chose to launch his war message. His action\r\nwas eagerly supported by Jefferson, Clay and Calhoun, and the younger\r\nmembers of his party.\r\n\r\nJefferson wrote to Duane: \"The acquisition of Canada this year (1812) as\r\nfar as the neighborhood of Quebec, will be a mere matter of marching,\r\nand will give us experience for the attack on Halifax, the next and the\r\nfinal expulsion of England from the American continent. Perhaps they\r\nwill burn New York or Boston. If they do, we must burn the city of\r\nLondon, not by expensive fleets of Congreve rockets, but by employing a\r\nhundred or two Jack-the-painters, whom nakedness, famine, desperation\r\nand hardened vice will abundantly furnish from among themselves.\"[92]\r\n\r\n  [92] \"Jack-the-painter\" was a miscreant employed by Silas Deane, one of\r\n  the U. S. Commissioners to France and the colleague of Dr. Franklin, to\r\n  burn the docks at Bristol. He partially succeeded and was hanged for the\r\n  crime, a far less infamous one than that advocated by Jefferson, the\r\n  champion of the rights of man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURNING OF NEWARK, CANADA, BY UNITED STATES TROOPS.\r\n\r\nIn retaliation for the destruction of the Public landing at Toronto and\r\nNewark, and other villages, the public building at Washington was\r\nburned.]\r\n\r\nThree months after making this prediction, the surrender of the United\r\nStates invading force to the British General Brock, or as Jefferson\r\npreferred to style it, \"the detestable treason of Hull,\" \"excited,\" he\r\nwrites, \"a deep anxiety in all breasts.\" A few months later we find him\r\nlamenting that \"our war on the land was commenced most inauspiciously.\"\r\nThis has resulted, he thinks, from the employment of generals before it\r\nis known whether they will \"stand fire\" and has cost us thousands of\r\ngood men and deplorable degradation of reputation.(*) \"The treachery,\r\ncowardice, and imbecility of the men in command has sunk our spirits at\r\nhome and our character abroad.\"[93]\r\n\r\n  [93] Jefferson's Works, Vol. VI., pp. 99, 193, 104.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the war of 1812, the whole number of British\r\ntroops in Canada was 4450, supplemented by about four thousand Canadian\r\nmilitia. With this corporal guard it was necessary to protect a frontier\r\nof over 1600 miles in length. Any part of this line was liable to an\r\ninvasion of United States troops whose lines of communication were far\r\nsuperior. Moreover Great Britain was unable to send reinforcements until\r\nafter the fall of Napoleon in June, 1814, when the war was nearly fought\r\nout.\r\n\r\nAmerican writers have always severely criticised the British for burning\r\nthe public buildings when they captured Washington. Ex-President\r\nJefferson, who proposed that the criminal classes of London should be\r\nhired to burn that city, stigmatized the burning of Washington as\r\n\"vandalism,\" and declared it would \"immortalize the infamy\" of Great\r\nBritain. He who could contemplate with equanimity the fearful horrors\r\nthat must have resulted from the putting in practice of his monstrous\r\nproposition to burn a city crowded with peaceful citizens, professed to\r\nbe horrified at the destruction of a few public buildings by which no\r\nman, woman or child, was injured in person or property. With equal\r\nhypocrisy he professed to believe that no provocation for the act was\r\ngiven by the United States commanders. Upon this point he was taken to\r\nan account by an open letter from Dr. John Strachan, afterwards Bishop\r\nof Toronto. This letter should be preserved as long as there lives a\r\nBritish apologist for the acts of the United States in the War of 1812.\r\nIn part it was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"As you are not ignorant of the mode of carrying on the war adopted by\r\nyour friends, you must have known it was a small retaliation after\r\nredress had been refused, for burnings and depredations not only of\r\npublic but private property, committed by them in Canada.\" In July, 1812,\r\nGeneral Hull invaded Upper Canada and threatened by proclamation to\r\nexterminate the inhabitants if they made any resistance. He plundered\r\nthose with whom he had been in habits of intimacy for years before the\r\nwar. Their linen and plate were found in his possession after his\r\nsurrender to General Brock. He marked out the loyal subjects of the king\r\nas objects of peculiar resentment, and consigned their property to\r\npillage and conflagration.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1813, the public buildings at York (now Toronto) the capital\r\nof Upper Canada, were burned by the troops of the United States contrary\r\nto the articles of capitulation. Much private property was plundered and\r\nseveral homes left in a state of ruin. Can you tell me, sir, the reason\r\nwhy the public buildings and library at Washington should be held more\r\nsacred than those at our York?\r\n\r\nIn June, 1813, Newark came into possession of your army, and its\r\ninhabitants were repeatedly promised protection to themselves and\r\nproperty by General Dearborne and General Boyd. In the midst of their\r\nprofessions the most respectable of them, almost all non-combatants,\r\nwere made prisoners and sent into the United States. The two churches\r\nwere burned to the ground; detachments were sent under the direction of\r\nBritish traitors to pillage the loyal inhabitants in the neighborhood\r\nand to carry them away captive. Many farm-houses were burned during the\r\nsummer and at length, to fill up the measure of iniquity, the whole of\r\nthe beautiful village of Newark was consigned to flames. The wretched\r\ninhabitants had scarcely time to save themselves, much less any of their\r\nproperty. More than four hundred women and children were exposed without\r\nshelter on the night of the tenth of December, to the extreme cold of a\r\nCanadian winter, and great numbers must have perished, had not the\r\nflight of your troops, after perpetrating their ferocious act, enabled\r\nthe inhabitants of the country to come to their relief. General McClure\r\nsays he acted in conformity with the order of his government.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1813, your friend General Wilkinson committed great\r\ndepredations through the eastern district of Upper Canada. The third\r\ncampaign exhibits equal enormities. General Brown laid waste the country\r\nbetween Chippewa and Fort Erie, burning mills and private houses. The\r\npleasant village of St. David was burned by his army when about to\r\nretreat. On the 15th of May a detachment of the American army pillaged\r\nand laid waste as much of the adjacent country as they could reach. They\r\nburned the village of Dover with all the mills, stores, distillery, and\r\ndwelling houses in the vicinity, carrying away such property as was\r\nportable, and killing the cattle.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of August, some American troops and Indians from Detroit\r\nsurprised the settlement of Port Talbot, where they committed the most\r\natrocious acts of violence, leaving upwards of 234 men, women and\r\nchildren in a state of nakedness and want.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURNING OF JAY IN EFFIGY.\r\n\r\nFor signing the Treaty of 1797 Jay was burned in effigy. Hamilton was\r\nstoned and the British Minister at Philadelphia insulted.]\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of December, a second excursion was made by the garrison of\r\nDetroit, spreading fire and pillage through the settlements of Upper\r\nCanada. Early in November, General McArthur, with a large body of\r\nmounted Kentuckians and Indians, made a rapid march through the western\r\npart of the London districts, burning all the mills, destroying\r\nprovisions and living upon the inhabitants. Other atrocities committed\r\nby the American troops, among them the wanton destruction of a tribe of\r\nIndians, unarmed and helpless, are detailed by Dr. Strachan. He adds,\r\naddressing Jefferson: \"This brief account of the conduct of your\r\ngovernment and army will fill the world with astonishment at the\r\nforbearance of Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\nAfter two years and a half had been expended in vain and puerile attacks\r\non the \"handful of soldiers\" with which Great Britain was able to resist\r\nits invasion, combined with such assistance as the patriotic Canadians\r\nwere able to afford, it was found that not only Canada could not be\r\nconquered, but that much of the territory of the United States had\r\npassed into the hands of the enemy, with not one foot of that enemy's\r\nterritory in their own hands to compensate for the loss.\r\n\r\nWhen the arms of the United States had suffered many reverses and it\r\nbecame plain that they must accept the best terms from Great Britain\r\nthat they could procure, John Adams declared that he \"would continue the\r\nwar forever rather than surrender one iota of the fisheries as\r\nestablished by the third article of the treaty of 1783.\" He boasted that\r\nhe had saved the fishermen in that year, and now in 1814 he learned with\r\ndismay that they were again lost to his country, their relinquishment\r\nbeing one of the terms insisted on by the British commission as the\r\nprice of peace.\r\n\r\nThe Federalists also were not easily satisfied. They admitted that peace\r\nwas a happy escape for a country with a bankrupt treasury, and all\r\nresources dissipated. \"But what,\" they asked, \"have we gained by a war\r\nprovoked and entered into by you with such a flourish of trumpets? Where\r\nare your 'sailors' rights?' Where is the indemnity for our impressed\r\nseamen? How about the paper blockade? The advantages you promised us we\r\nhave not obtained. But we have lost nothing? Have we not? What about\r\nGrand Manan and Moose Island and the fisheries and our West Indian\r\ncommerce?\" So severely did Boston suffer that there were sixty vessels\r\ncaptured at the entrance to the harbor by one small fishing smack of\r\nLiverpool, Nova Scotia, cruising in Massachusetts Bay.\r\n\r\nAll who were concerned in the passage of the treaty were the subjects of\r\nthe popular wrath. Jay was declared to be an \"arch traitor,\" a \"Judas\r\nwho had betrayed his country with a kiss,\" and was burned in effigy in a\r\ndozen cities. Hamilton was stoned; the name of Washington was hooted,\r\nand the British flag dragged in the mud.\r\n\r\nEdmund Quincy, in the life of his father, says, \"The fall of Bonaparte,\r\nalthough it occasioned as genuine joy to New England as to the mother\r\ncountry herself, did not bring with it absolutely unalloyed\r\nsatisfaction.\" There was reason to apprehend that the English\r\nadministration, triumphant over its gigantic foe, its army and navy\r\nreleased from the incessant service of so many years, might concentrate\r\nthe whole of the empire upon the power which it regarded as a volunteer\r\nally of its mighty enemy, and administer an exemplary chastisement. No\r\ndoubt many Englishmen felt, with Sir Walter Scott, that \"it was their\r\nbusiness to give the Americans a fearful memento, that the babe unborn\r\nshould have remembered,\" and there is as little question that infinite\r\ndamage might have been done to our cities and seacoast and to the banks\r\nof our great rivers, had Great Britain employed her entire naval and\r\nmilitary forces for that purpose. But happily the English people wisely\r\nrefrained from an expenditure of blood and gold which could have no\r\npermanent good result, and which would only serve to exasperate passions\r\nand to prolong animosities which it was far wiser to permit to die out.\r\nIt is not unlikely that the attention of English people had been so\r\nabsorbed by the mighty conflict going on at their very doors that they\r\nhad not much to spare for the distant and comparatively obscure fields\r\nacross the Atlantic, and indeed the sentiments of the English people and\r\nthe policy of English governments have never exhibited a spirit of\r\nrevengefulness. The American war was but a slight episode in the great\r\nepic of the age. At any rate the English ministry were content to treat\r\nwith the American commissioners at Ghent and to make a peace which left\r\nuntouched the pretended occasion for the war, over in expressive\r\nsilence, and peace was concluded, leaving \"sailors' rights\" the great\r\nwatchword of the war party, substantially as they stood before\r\nhostilities began, except that our fishermen were deprived of the\r\nvaluable privilege they enjoyed of catching and curing fish on the\r\nshores of the Gulf of the St. Lawrence.[94]\r\n\r\n  [94] Life of Josiah Quincy, p. 358.\r\n\r\nThe news of peace was received in Boston with great joy. It was a day\r\ngiven up to rejoicing; salutes were fired; the bells rang out their\r\nmerriest peals; the volunteer companies with their bands filled the\r\nstreets; the school boys took a holiday; the wharves so long deserted\r\nwere thronged, and the melancholy ships that rotted along side them were\r\nonce more gay with flags and streamers. Thus rejoicing extended all\r\nalong the seaboard and far inland, making glad all hearts and none more\r\nglad than those of the promoters of the war in high places and low.[95]\r\n\r\n  [95] Life of Josiah Quincy, pp. 360, 361.\r\n\r\nAnd so the \"war of 1812\" ended amid a general joy, not for what it had\r\naccomplished, for the American forces were defeated in their invasion of\r\nCanada, and the United States did not acquire one foot of additional\r\nterritory, or the settlement of any of the questions which were the\r\npretext for the war.\r\n\r\nMuch that occurred during the war of 1812 has been conveniently\r\nforgotten by American historians, and much that had not occurred,\r\nremembered. By degrees failure was transformed into success. The new\r\ngenerations were taught that in that war their fathers had won a great\r\nvictory over the whole power of Great Britain single handed and alone.\r\nThis amazing belief is still cherished among the people of the United\r\nStates, to the astonishment of well informed visitors who meet with\r\nevidence of the fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n_THE CIVIL WAR AND THE PART TAKEN BY GREAT BRITAIN IN SAME._\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the first fifty years after the Revolution, the wealthy aristocratic\r\nslave-holding Southern states governed the Union and controlled its\r\ndestiny. The acquisition of Florida and the Louisiana purchase doubled\r\nthe area of the United States, and the territory derived from the\r\nMexican War doubled it again. It was the intention of the South to\r\nextend slavery over this immense territory, but they were checked in the\r\nnorthern part of it by the enormous European immigration that poured\r\ninto it and prevented it from becoming slave territory. Then came the\r\n\"irrepressible conflict,\" the border war in Missouri and \"bleeding\r\nKansas,\" the battle of Ossawatomie and Harper's Ferry raid, and the\r\nconstant pin-pricking of the abolition societies in the North, the\r\nheadquarters of which were in Boston.\r\n\r\nThe presidential election of 1860 showed the South that they had lost\r\ncontrol of the government and that the free states were increasing\r\nenormously in wealth and population, and that, following the example of\r\nGreat Britain, it would be only a question of time before they would\r\ninsist on abolishing slavery. Then it was that the Southerners decided\r\nto do what their fathers had done eighty-five years before, secede and\r\nbecome Dis-unionists. They could not believe that there would be any\r\nopposition to their leaving, especially from Massachusetts, that place\r\nthat had always been foremost in disunion sentiments. Besides, had not\r\nthe Abolitionists said repeatedly in Faneuil Hall, \"The Cradle of\r\nLiberty,\" that if they would leave the Union they would \"pave their way\r\nwith gold\" to get rid of them, and did not the New York Tribune, which\r\nhad been the organ of the Abolitionists, and which now declared that \"if\r\nthe cotton states wished to withdraw from the Union they should be\r\nallowed to do so\"; that \"any attempt to compel them to remain by force\r\nwould be contrary to the principles of the Declaration of Independence,\r\nand to the fundamental idea upon which human liberty is based,\" and that\r\n\"if the Declaration of Independence justified the secession from the\r\nBritish Empire of three million subjects in 1776, it was not seen why it\r\nwould not justify the secession of five million of Southerners from the\r\nUnion in 1861.\" This was quite consistent with the remark of a leading\r\nAbolitionist paper in Boston that \"the Constitution was a covenant with\r\nhell.\" The South also contended that even if they were not justified in\r\nbecoming Dis-unionists in 1776, they had established their right to\r\nindependence by force of arms and that when they had entered into a\r\nconfederation with the other seceding colonies, they had never assigned\r\nany of their rights which they had fought for, that they were sovereign,\r\nindependent states, and that the bond that bound them together was\r\nsimply for self-protection and was what the name signified \"United\r\nStates,\" and not a nation. In proof of this they stated that when the\r\nconvention met in Philadelphia in May, 1787, for the purpose of adopting\r\na constitution for a stronger form of government, the first resolution\r\npresented was, \"Resolved, That it is the opinion of this committee that\r\na national government ought to be established, consisting of a supreme\r\nlegislature, executive and judiciary.\" This was followed by twenty-three\r\nother resolutions as adopted and reported by the committee in which the\r\nword \"national\" occurred twenty-six times. Mr. Ellsworth, of Connecticut\r\nmoved to strike out the word \"national\" and to insert the words\r\n\"Government of the United States.\" This was agreed to unanimously, and\r\nthe word \"national\" was stricken out wherever it occurred, and nowhere\r\nmakes its appearance in the Constitution finally adopted. The prompt\r\nrejection of this word \"national\" is obviously much more expressive of\r\nthe intent of the authors of the Constitution than its mere absence from\r\nthe Constitution would have been. It is a clear indication that they did\r\nnot mean to give any countenance to the idea that the government which\r\nthey organized was a consolidated nationality instead of a confederacy\r\nof sovereign members. The question of secession was first raised by men\r\nof Massachusetts, the birthplace of secession. Colonel Timothy Pickering\r\nwas one of the leading secessionists of his day. He had been an officer\r\nin the Revolution; afterwards Postmaster General, Secretary of War,\r\nSecretary of State in the cabinet of General Washington and senator from\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nWriting to a friend on December 24, 1803, he says: \"I will not despair.\r\nI will rather anticipate a new confederacy exempt from the corrupt and\r\ncorrupting influence and oppression of the aristocratic Democrats of the\r\nSouth. There will be (and our children, at farthest, will see it) a\r\nseparation. The white and black population will mark the boundary.\"[96]\r\n\r\nIn another letter, written in January 29, 1804, he said: \"The principles\r\nof our Revolution point to the remedy--a separation. This can be\r\naccomplished and without spilling one drop of blood, I have little\r\ndoubt. It must begin in Massachusetts.\"[96]\r\n\r\n  [96] Life of Cabot, p. 491.\r\n\r\nIn 1811, on the bill for the admission of Louisiana as a state of the\r\nUnion, the Hon. Josiah Quincy, a member of Congress from Massachusetts,\r\nsaid: \"If this bill pass, it is my deliberate opinion that it is\r\nvirtually a dissolution of this Union; that it will free the states from\r\nother moral obligations, and as it will be the right of all, so it will\r\nbe the duty of some definitely to prepare for a separation, amicably, if\r\nthey can, violently if they must.\"\r\n\r\nThe war between the North and the South produced an abundant crop of\r\nbitter prejudices against the mother country. This sentiment was shared\r\nby the South as well as by the North. Each imagined it had been unfairly\r\ntreated by the British Government.\r\n\r\nAmericans continually point to the period of the Civil war and\r\ntriumphantly declare that Englishmen were unfriendly to the United\r\nStates at that time. So they were. And Englishmen were unfriendly to the\r\nConfederate states during that time. In fact, Englishmen did exactly\r\nwhat Americans did at that time--some took the side of the North and\r\nothers took the side of the South. This it was their privilege to do.\r\nThey simply asserted the right of free men to think as they pleased, and\r\nto express those thoughts freely. But that in so doing they showed\r\nhostility to the United States it is false and foolish to assert. There\r\nwas neither unfriendliness nor malice. This hostility to the South, so\r\nfar as it existed, was based solely upon the existence of slavery there.\r\nThat which existed against the North was based solely upon the belief\r\nthat a stronger power was taking advantage of its strength to trample\r\nupon the political rights of a weaker one. Any person living either\r\nNorth or South at that time cannot deny that they met many examples of\r\nboth of these opinions among their respective acquaintances in both\r\nthese sections.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the Civil War, the Queen issued a proclamation of\r\nneutrality, forbidding the sale of munitions of war to either party,\r\nwarning her subjects against entering any blockaded port for purposes of\r\ntrade under penalty of forfeiture of vessel and cargo if captured by\r\neither contestant.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain, as well as all other civilized powers, granted to the\r\nConfederacy belligerent rights, the same as had been accorded to them by\r\nthe United States. Many, through cupidity, were tempted to enter into an\r\nillegal traffic with the seceded states.\r\n\r\nA writer at that time says: \"It is to the disgrace of our country that\r\nsome of the goods smuggled into the Confederacy via Nassau were from\r\nNorthern ports, as for example, shiploads of pistols brought from Boston\r\nin barrels of lard.\" There was also a considerable trade between Boston\r\nand Confederate ports via Halifax during the war, as well as an immense\r\namount of contraband trade along the border even by the United States\r\nofficials, as for example, the exploits of General Benjamin F. Butler\r\nwhile in command at Norfolk, Va., in 1864. If citizens of the United\r\nStates, even those of Massachusetts, the home of the abolitionists,\r\nentered into this traffic, what could be expected of Great Britain with\r\nher mills closed and thousands of operatives obliged to resort to the\r\npoor rates for subsistence, because she was prevented from buying cotton\r\nwith which the wharves of the Southern states were loaded down awaiting\r\nshipment. It was claimed by Unionists that the British ministry and\r\naristocracy, from political and commercial considerations, openly and\r\nheartily sympathized with the South, and that, under the friendly flag\r\nof Great Britain, secessionists and blockade-runners were welcomed and\r\nassisted in the nefarious traffic; that this unfriendliness of the\r\nBritish government at that time furnished a solid foundation upon which\r\nthe rebellion rested their hopes, thereby protracting the war. It\r\nshould not be forgotten, however, that the Queen and the royal family\r\nstood faithfully by the Union in the days of its sorest peril, and\r\nrefused to listen to the importunities of the French emperor, to\r\nrecognize the Southern Confederacy and open the southern ports.\r\n\r\nFrance, having taken advantage of the Civil War, set the Monroe Doctrine\r\nat defiance and conquered Mexico. Her remaining there depended on the\r\nsuccess of the Confederacy, as after events proved. Had Great Britain\r\nlistened to France and joined her in recognizing the Southern\r\nConfederacy, the South would have surely succeeded. It is generally\r\nadmitted that the strict blockade of the Southern ports is what defeated\r\nthe Confederacy. It is due to Great Britain that the United States is\r\nnot dismembered. It should be remembered that during the Civil War the\r\ngreat body of British workmen were on the side of the North. Even in the\r\ncotton famine districts they preferred to starve rather than have the\r\nSouthern ports opened whereby they could obtain an abundance of cotton,\r\nthereby relieving their sore necessities.\r\n\r\nIt is also true that the Confederacy had many friends in Great Britain;\r\nthat Gladstone, the great Liberal Chancellor of the Exchequer, so far\r\nforgot what was due to his position as to make a speech in which he said\r\n\"he expected the liberation of the slaves by their own masters sooner\r\nthan from the North; that Jefferson Davis and the leaders of the South\r\nhave made an army; they are soon, I understand, to have a navy, but\r\ngreater than all this, they have made a nation.\"\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that in building a navy the government connived at\r\nthe building of cruisers, such as the Alabama, in British shipyards, for\r\nwhich they had to pay dearly afterwards. In answer to this speech of\r\nGladstone, the robust yet tender tones of John Bright's voice rang out\r\nfor the Northern cause in the darkest hour of the Civil War. His voice\r\nwas heard with no uncertain sound when he uttered his indignant protest\r\nat anything like a reception being tendered Mason and Slidell on their\r\nrelease. John Bright for a long time sustained the enormous loss of\r\nkeeping his mills open at hast half time with no material to work with.\r\nThere he stood, all Quaker as he was, praying that the North might not\r\nstay its hand till the last slave was freed, even if no bales of cotton\r\nwere sent to relieve his grievious losses protesting against outside\r\ninterference. When the day came that marked the passing away of this\r\nvenerable patriot, one of earth's greatest and best, an attempt was made\r\nin Congress to pass a vote of sympathy to his family and to the shame\r\nand disgrace of the United States it must be said that Congress refused\r\nto pay even this poor tribute to the memory of the best friend the\r\nUnited States had in the whole wide world in the hour of her great\r\ndistress. This was done because it would be \"offensive to the Irish.\"\r\nJohn Bright could see no difference between dis-union in the United\r\nStates and dis-union in the United Kingdom. He had written to Mr.\r\nGladstone concerning Parnell, Dillon, O'Brien, etc., saying, \"You deem\r\nthem patriots; I hold them not to be patriots, but conspirators against\r\nthe crown and government of the United Kingdom.\" These men were\r\nafterwards found guilty of criminal conspiracy and Parnell was received\r\nwith honor on the floor of Congress.\r\n\r\nHenry Ward Beecher stated that during the American Civil War there were\r\nthousands of mass meetings held in Great Britain in favor of the Union\r\ncause, and not one in favor of the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nJefferson Davis complained bitterly of the action of Great Britain. He\r\nsays \"The partiality of Her Majesty's government in favor of our enemies\r\nwas further evinced in the marked difference of its conduct on the\r\nsubject of the purchase of supplies by the two belligerents. This\r\ndifference was conspicuous from the commencement of the war.\"(*) Great\r\nBritain endeavored to deal justly with both parties in the contest, but\r\npleased neither and was blamed by both. This is probably the best\r\nevidence that can be given to show the impartiality of Great Britain in\r\nthe great Civil War, and it is safe to say that there were ten times\r\nmore British subjects serving in the Northern armies than there were in\r\nthe Southern.\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, Great Britain has been greatly blamed by American\r\nhistorians for her treatment of American prisoners of war during the\r\nRevolution, and at Dartmouth prison in the war of 1812. In view of these\r\nfacts it will be interesting to see how the Americans treated their\r\nprisoners when at war between themselves in the Civil War of 1861. One\r\nof the worst cases recorded in the history of the world is that of\r\nAndersonville. The first prisoners were received there in March, 1864.\r\nFrom that time till March, 1865, the deaths were 13,000 out of a total\r\nof 50,000 or 26 per cent. This enormous loss of life was due to the fact\r\nthat in order to subjugate the South their crops were destroyed, their\r\nfields devastated, their railroads broken up, which interrupted their\r\nmeans of transportation, which reduced their people, troops and\r\nprisoners to the most straitened condition for food. If the troops in\r\nthe field were in a half-starved condition, certainly the prisoners\r\nwould fare worse.(*) The Confederates have been blamed for this enormous\r\nloss of life, but when the facts are examined it is found that it was\r\ndue to the cold-blooded policy of the Federal Government, who would not\r\nexchange prisoners for the atrocious reason set forth in the dispatch\r\nfrom General Grant to General Butler, dated West Point, August 18, 1864.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant says: \"On the subject of exchange, however, I differ from\r\nGeneral Hitchcock. It is hard on our men in Southern prisons not to\r\nexchange them, but it is humanity to those left in the ranks to fight\r\nour battles. Every man released on parole or otherwise becomes an active\r\nsoldier against us at once, either directly or indirectly. If we\r\ncommence a system of exchange, which liberates all prisoners taken, we\r\nwill have to fight on till the whole South is exterminated. If we hold\r\nthose caught, they amount to no more than dead men. At this particular\r\ntime to release all rebel prisoners North would insure Sherman's defeat\r\nand would compromise our safety.\"\r\n\r\nWhat brought forth this letter was a statement made by the Confederate\r\ngovernment concerning the excessive mortality prevailing among the\r\nprisoners of Andersonville. As no answer was received, another\r\ncommunication was sent on Aug. 22, 1864 to Major General E. A.\r\nHitchcock, United States Commissioner of Exchange, concerning the same\r\nproposal. But again no answer was made. One final effort was made to\r\nobtain an exchange. Jefferson Davis sent a delegation of prisoners from\r\nAndersonville to Washington. \"It was of no avail. They were made to\r\nunderstand that the interest of the government required that they should\r\nreturn to prison and President Lincoln refused to see them. They carried\r\nback the sad tidings that their government held out no hope of their\r\nrelease.\"[97]\r\n\r\n  [97] Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, Vol. II., p. 606.\r\n\r\nUp to this time the mortality among the prisoners had been far greater\r\nin the Northern prisons than in the Southern prisons, notwithstanding\r\nthere was an abundance of food and clothing and medical supplies in the\r\nNorth. In proof of this it is only necessary to offer two facts. First,\r\nthe report of the Secretary of War, E. M. Stanton, made on July 19,\r\n1866, shows that of all the prisoners held by the Confederates during\r\nthe war, only 22,576 died, while of the prisoners held by the Federal\r\ngovernment, 26,246 died.\r\n\r\nSecond, the official report of Surgeon General Barnes, an officer of the\r\nU. S. Government, stated that the number of Confederate prisoners in\r\ntheir hands amounted to 220,000. The number of U. S. prisoners in\r\nConfederate hands amounted to 270,000. Thus out of 270,000 held by the\r\nConfederates 22,000 died, and of the 220,000 Confederates held in the\r\nNorth, 26,000 died. Thus 12 per cent of the Confederates died in\r\nNorthern prisons and only 9 per cent U. S. prisoners died in the\r\nSouth.[98]\r\n\r\n  [98] Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, Vol. II., p. 606.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n_RECONCILIATION. THE DISMEMBERED EMPIRE RE-UNITED IN BONDS OF\r\nFRIENDSHIP. \"BLOOD IS THICKER THAN WATER.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well known and now acknowledged that for the past hundred years it\r\nhas been the deliberate and well considered policy of the United States\r\nto eradicate everything British from the country to the north of us.\r\n\r\nDuring the Canadian rebellion of 1837, as well as during the Fenian raid\r\nof 1866, the American frontier was openly allowed to be made a base of\r\noperation against British North America.\r\n\r\nCanada has always claimed that she has been deprived of enormous areas\r\nof territory by the United States through sharp practice and\r\nunjustifiable means, especially in Oregon, Maine and Alaska. The most\r\nnotable case of duplicity on the part of the United States was that of\r\nthe Northeast boundary settled under the Ashburton Treaty of Washington\r\nin 1842. After a bitter controversy it was left out to arbitration for\r\nthe King of the Netherlands to decide. The award was accepted by Great\r\nBritain and rejected by the United States. The question remained in\r\nabeyance for two years, during which there was imminent danger of a\r\ncollision and of war. Military posts were simultaneously established and\r\nrashly advanced into the wild country which both parties claimed as\r\ntheir own. Redoubts and blockhouses were erected at several points.\r\nReinforcement of troops from either side poured in. The public mind in\r\nthe United States became inflamed by the too ready cry of \"British\r\noutrage,\" proclaimed in all quarters by the reckless politicians of both\r\nparties in order to lash the national spirit into fury. The people in\r\nthe whole length and breadth of the Union were, to a man, convinced of\r\nthe justice of their claim and of the manifest wrong intended by Great\r\nBritain. The Nation at large was ready and anxious for war, and had a\r\nskirmish taken place on the frontier involving the death of a dozen men\r\nduring the so-called \"Aroostook War,\" the whole country would have\r\nrushed to war and plunged the two nations into hostilities, the end of\r\nwhich no man then living could have foreseen.\r\n\r\nDuring this trouble, the English people were quite calm and almost\r\napathetic. With a vague notion of the locality of the disputed\r\nterritory, a total ignorance of the merits or demerits of the dispute,\r\nand a profound contempt of the blustering and abuse of American\r\npoliticians and newspapers, they were perfectly content to leave affairs\r\nin the hands of the government.\r\n\r\nFinally a joint commission was appointed from the States of Maine and\r\nMassachusetts (both having rights in the disputed territory) and sent to\r\nWashington to negotiate a treaty with Lord Ashburton, a nobleman well\r\nadapted to the occasion from his connection by marriage, and property in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe odds were greatly against the British negotiator. His principal\r\nadversary was Daniel Webster, Secretary of State, who in one of his\r\nletters said: \"I must be permitted to say that few questions have arisen\r\nunder this government in regard to which a stronger or more general\r\nconviction was felt that the country was in the right than this question\r\nof the northeast boundary.\" He reiterated his own belief in \"the justice\r\nof the claim which arose from our honest conviction that it was founded\r\nin truth and accorded with the intention of the negotiators of the\r\ntreaty of 1783.\" The whole of the disputed territory amounted to\r\n6,750,000 acres. At last a compromise was effected which granted to\r\nGreat Britain 3,337,000 acres, and to the United States 3,413,000 acres,\r\nand acknowledged the title of England to all the military positions upon\r\nthe frontier, and 700,000 acres more was awarded her than was assigned\r\nto her by the King of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nBut the decision of the Commissioners suited neither party. The factions\r\nin England pronounced Lord Ashburton to have been sold, and those in\r\nAmerica declared that Webster had been bought. The most violent\r\nopposition to the treaty was made; every part of it was denounced, and\r\nit became at last doubtful if the Senate would ratify it. That final\r\nconsummation was, however, suddenly effected in a most remarkable\r\nmanner, the Senate coming to its decision by an unexpected majority of\r\nthirty-nine to nine, after several days of secret debate. The sanction\r\nof the Queen and the British government had been given without\r\nhesitation and the people on both sides of the Atlantic were well\r\nsatisfied with the termination of the long and virulent dispute, and the\r\nNortheastern Boundary Question would have sunk into the archives of\r\ndiplomatic history, but truth like murder will out, and it so happened\r\nthat Mr. Thomas Colley Grattan, British Consul for Massachusetts[99]\r\nwho, at the request of the commissioners, had accompanied them to\r\nWashington to assist them in their negotiation, had the fortune to\r\ndiscover after the treaty was signed, the duplicity of the Senate during\r\ntheir secret debates leading to the ratification of the treaty. He says:\r\n\"My informant gave unmeasured expression to his indignation, which he\r\nassured me was fully shared in by his friends, Judge Story and Dr.\r\nChanning. Judge Story expressed himself without reserve on Webster's\r\nconduct as a 'most disgraceful proceeding.'\" Other gentlemen of Boston\r\nentirely coincided in these opinions.\r\n\r\n  [99] For full particulars see his work, \"Civilized America,\" Vol. I,\r\n  Chap. XXI, XXII, XXIII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of the Boundary Line between Maine and New\r\nBrunswick.]\r\n\r\n\"It is obvious to all persons familiar with boundary disputes that the\r\nmost important evidence in such disputes is founded on surveys and maps.\r\nEarly in the controversy there was a strange disappearance of the one in\r\nthe archives of the State Department, that had been transmitted by\r\nFranklin to Jefferson in October, 1790, with the true boundary line\r\ntraced on it. It was, therefore, with great astonishment that I learned\r\nfrom the confidential communication just alluded to that during the\r\nwhole of the negotiations at Washington, while the highest functionaries\r\nof the American Government were dealing with Lord Ashburton with seeming\r\nfrankness and integrity, pledging their faith for a perfect conviction\r\nof the justice of their claim to the territory which was in dispute. Mr.\r\nWebster had in his possession and had communicated to them\r\nall--President, Cabinet, Commissioners and Senate--the highest evidence\r\nwhich the case admitted, that the United States had never had a shadow\r\nof right to any part of the territory which they had so pertinaciously\r\nclaimed for nearly fifty years. This evidence, as my conscientious\r\ninformant told me, was nothing less than a copy of an original map\r\npresented by Dr. Franklin to Count de Vergennes, the Minister of Louis\r\nXVI, on December 6, 1782 (six days after the preliminaries of the treaty\r\nof Paris of 1783 were signed) tracing the boundary, as agreed upon by\r\nhimself and the other commissioners, with a strong red line south of the\r\nSt. John, and exactly where a similar line appears in an unauthenticated\r\nmap discovered in London subsequent to Lord Ashburton's departure on his\r\nmission.\"\r\n\r\nPublic attention being aroused by the statements made by the British\r\nConsul to his government, the injunction of secrecy imposed by the\r\nSenate on its members was dissolved, and permission was given for the\r\npublication of the speeches made in secret session of August 17-19,\r\n1842. The most important of those speeches was that of Mr. Rives,\r\nchairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. His principal argument was\r\nthat if they did not sign the treaty, the dispute would be referred to a\r\nsecond arbitration with very great danger of their losing the whole, Mr.\r\nWebster, the Secretary of State, having sent to him to be laid before\r\nthe Senate a communication and a copy of the map presented by Dr.\r\nFranklin to Count de Vergennes. In short, it is exactly the line\r\ncontended for by Great Britain except that it concedes more than is\r\nclaimed. When this communication was read, Senator Benton informed the\r\nSenate that he could produce a map of higher validity than the one\r\nreferred to. He accordingly repaired to the library of Congress and soon\r\nreturned with a map which there is no doubt was the one sent by Franklin\r\nto Jefferson already alluded to as having been surreptitiously removed\r\nfrom the archives of the State Department some years before. The moment\r\nit was examined it was found to sustain, by the most precise and\r\nremarkable correspondence in every feature, the map communicated by Mr.\r\nWebster. Mr. Benton then stated that \"if the maps were really authentic\r\nthe concealment of them was a fraud on the British, and that the Senate\r\nwas insulted by being a party to the fraud,\" and further that \"if\r\nevidence had been discovered which deprived Maine of the title to\r\none-third of its territory, honor required that it should be made known\r\nto the British.\"\r\n\r\nThe sudden acceptance of the treaty was in consequence of the evidence\r\nof the maps, and the conviction of all concerned that a discovery of\r\ntheir existence before the conclusion of a treaty would have given\r\nirresistible strength to the English claims.\r\n\r\nCalhoun said: \"It would be idle to suppose that these disclosures would\r\nnot weigh heavily against the United States in any future negotiations.\"\r\n\r\nThe settlement of the Oregon boundary question again showed American\r\nhatred of England to be chronic. The question finally resolved itself\r\ninto whether the threat of 54.40 or fight should be carried out, (a\r\nthreat to deprive Canada of access to the Pacific Ocean and the\r\npossession of most of the enormous wheat fields now being developed in\r\nthe northwest) or to fight Mexico and extend its boundaries to the South\r\ninstead of the north. This latter scheme suited the slaveholders best\r\nwho were then in power. The United States government then entered into a\r\nwar with Mexico, one of the most unjustifiable contests ever entered\r\ninto by a civilized nation. By this war of conquest the United States\r\nnearly doubled its territory. It must be said to the credit of New\r\nEngland that she would not take any part in this war any more than she\r\ndid in the war of 1812.\r\n\r\nWhen confederation of the Canadian provinces occurred in 1867, there was\r\nplaced on record in the House of Representatives at Washington that it\r\nwas disapproved and that the House regarded the Act of Confederation as\r\na menace to the United States. For a hundred years after the Revolution\r\nit had been the policy of the United States to force Canada into\r\nannexation, and it was considered that she would be more likely to come\r\ninto the Union if she was harrassed by a high tariff, boundary and\r\nfishing disputes, but now it is known to have been all wrong. The\r\nfactors worked out just the reverse. Conditions have arrived that were\r\nlittle foreseen until within ten years. The American people have\r\nrecognized the fact that a great change has taken place in Canada which\r\nmaterially effects the relation between Canada and the United States.\r\nMr. Root, U. S. Secretary of State, recently said:\r\n\r\n\"Canada is no longer the outlying northern country in which a fringe of\r\ndescendants of royalists emigrating from the colonies when they became\r\nindependent of Great Britain, lived and gained a precarious subsistence\r\nfrom a fertile soil. It has become the home of a great people increasing\r\nin population and wealth. The stirrings of a national sentiment are to\r\nbe felt. In their relations to England one can see that while still\r\nloyal to their mother country, still a loyal part of the British Empire,\r\nthey are growing up, and, as the boy is to his parents when he attains\r\nmanhood, they are a personality of themselves. In their relations to us\r\nthey have become a sister nation. With their enormous national wealth,\r\nwith their vigor and energy following the pathway that we have followed,\r\nprotecting their industries as we have protected ours, proud of their\r\ncountry as we are proud of ours, they are no longer the little remnants\r\nupon our borders; they are a great and powerful sister nation.\"\r\n\r\nFor years after the Civil War there came from the press, from the\r\nlecture platform, and from the political rostrum, the most relentless\r\nabuse of Great Britain and everything British. Lecturers gave their\r\naudiences vivid descriptions of the Revolution and the war of 1812, in\r\nwhich American valor was always rated high and British brutality was\r\nheld up to scorn. These lectures were frequently of thrilling interest\r\nbecause the speakers were not handicapped by matters so paltry as facts\r\nof history. But the most formidable batteries of wrath were trained\r\nagainst everything British from the political stump. The iron-lunged\r\norators told of the iniquity of England, of its infamous tariff laws,\r\nthe oppression of Ireland, etc. He was but a poor speaker who could not\r\nenliven a political meeting by twisting the tail of the British lion.\r\nAll this is now changed. It was brought about by President Cleveland's\r\nVenezuelian message of December, 1895, and the Spanish War. When the\r\nVenezuelian episode occurred, England was believed to be isolated and\r\nwithout an ally. It proved that war could be declared against Great\r\nBritain at any time, in ten minutes, upon any pretext. The insolent\r\nmessage fell upon every one in England, from Lord Salisbury down, as a\r\nbolt from the blue sky. Englishmen were as innocent as babes of\r\nintentional offence to the United States. They had no conception that\r\nthere existed in the United States such latent irritation or antagonism\r\nas under the first provocation would lead to an almost open avowal of\r\nnational enmity. It, however, happily disclosed the fact that there\r\nstill existed in the United States a numerous highly educated and\r\nconservative element (not dissimilar to the vanished Loyalists of the\r\nlast century) in which one seldom finds a trace of antagonism to the old\r\nmother country. Following the message, magazine reviews, the public\r\npress, and the pulpit overflowed with a brilliant series of public\r\nutterances and these soon checked the noisy approving outbursts of a\r\nreckless half-educated majority to obtain whose votes at the next\r\nelection undoubtedly prompted the presumptuous interference of the chief\r\nof the Republic and the unfriendly tone of his message.\r\n\r\nWithin three years after the message a wonderful change came over the\r\npeople of the United States. The Spanish War had taken place and instead\r\nof finding Great Britain to be the hereditary enemy of the United\r\nStates, which they had been taught in the school histories to believe,\r\nit was found that among the great powers of the world, Great Britain was\r\nthe only friend which the United States had, and that \"blood was thicker\r\nthan water.\" It was discovered that the nations were envious of the\r\ngreat Republic, and that Britain alone was proud of her eldest daughter.\r\nIt was remarked to the writer by a Spanish officer shortly after the\r\nsurrender of Porto Rico: \"But mind you, this from an old man who has\r\nstudied history. You would never have had these islands had not England\r\nstepped in at the beginning of the trouble and said to all the nations\r\nof the world, 'Allow me to present my daughter, America.'\" It was found,\r\ntoo, that the \"traditional friendship\" of Russia was of but little\r\naccount at that time.\r\n\r\nIt was Russia that eagerly became the spokesman for envious Europe and\r\ngave voice to the words: \"Now is the time for us to combine and crush\r\nthis huge American monster before she becomes too strong for all of us,\r\nas she is already too strong for any one of us.\" It was Russia that\r\nplanned to have the \"concert of Europe\" warn us that we were not to pose\r\nas champion of any other American people against any form of misrule by\r\nEurope--and that we were not to dare to meddle in Europe on any pretext.\r\n\r\nShe failed because England refused to join the league, or to enter with\r\nthe other powers into a naval demonstration before Cuba, but so long as\r\nthe war lasted with Spain the Russian diplomats kept pounding at every\r\nbackdoor in Europe with an insistence that something be done to cut our\r\ncomb, or make trouble or lose us the friendship of England. Our people\r\nin Washington know all this. They know also the behavior of the Russian\r\nminister at Washington who thought to poison us against England in the\r\nvery days when we were buying in that country and shipping in secret\r\nfrom that country the vital necessities which the war demanded and which\r\nwe had not got; when great steamers were found abandoned off New York\r\nloaded with contraband of war, cannon, arms, ammunition, etc., and towed\r\ninto port by United States warships; when coal and ammunition were left\r\non desert islands in the Philippines by British warships for the use of\r\nthe United States navy; when England's fleet at Manila stood ready to\r\ntake sides with Dewey and to open fire, to begin war on the Germans\r\nshould occasion arise. American naval officers who were there know these\r\nfacts to be true, and it is very significant that the Navy Department\r\nhas not published the correspondence between it and Admiral Dewey at\r\nthat time. We are hated all over the continent of Europe. Paris made a\r\nfete day when she imagined Sampson's fleet was destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe Germans hate us for taking 3,000,000 fighting men away from them,\r\nand also because we prevented them from purchasing the Philippines from\r\nSpain, and because the Monroe doctrine prevents them from obtaining\r\ncolonies or naval stations in the Western Hemisphere. The Austrians hate\r\nus for humiliating Spain. There is not a country to the south of us but\r\nwhat hates us. Every republic in South America would put a knife in our\r\nback if the opportunity occurs.\r\n\r\nVery significant, too, was the reception and banquet given at Windsor\r\nCastle in 1896 by Queen Victoria to the Ancient and Honorable Artillery\r\nCompany of Boston--the oldest military organization in the Western\r\nHemisphere--and the grand reception they received everywhere they went\r\nin England. It was a revelation to the Americans, as every one of them\r\nacknowledged, to receive such marked expression of kindliness and\r\nbrotherhood at the old home. It was something they did not expect. The\r\ncompany more than reciprocated when the parent company, The Honourable\r\nArtillery of London, visited Boston in 1903. Once more were seen armed\r\nBritish sailors and soldiers marching through Boston's streets under the\r\nBritish flag, the buildings along the entire route beautifully\r\ndecorated, and the visitors received with vociferous welcome wherever\r\nthey went. We will hope that something even better and more substantial\r\nmay yet come to us, when the United States and Great Britain will be\r\nallied in amity as firm as that which now holds together these federal\r\nstates. \"Old prejudices should be cast aside; the English-speaking\r\nstates recognizing their kinship, should knit bonds together around the\r\nworld, forming a kingly brotherhood inspired by beneficence, to which\r\nsupreme dominion in the earth would be sure to fall; for whatever may be\r\nsaid today for other stocks, the 135,000,000 of English-speaking men\r\nhave been able to make themselves masters of the world to an extent\r\nwhich no people has thus far approached.\r\n\r\n\"If love would but once unite, the seas could never sever. Earth has\r\nnever beheld a co-mingling of men, so impressive, so likely to be\r\nfrought with noble advantages through ages to come, as would be the\r\ncoming together of English-speaking men in one cordial bond.\"[100]\r\n\r\n  [100] Short History of Anglo-Saxon Freedom.\r\n\r\nThe statesmen of Britain and America can do no worthier service than to\r\nfind a way by which their strength may be combined to secure the peace\r\nof the world and the betterment of mankind. It is not necessary that\r\ntheir governments should be unified, or even that any hard and fast\r\ntreaty obligation incurred. It is only necessary that they should agree\r\nto be friends and to stand by each other in all that will further these\r\ngreat objects. They alone of all the nations can do this and that they\r\nought to do it few will deny. Both must forget certain bitterness born\r\nof the past and certain jealousies growing out of the greatness of both.\r\n\r\nWhat Great Britain is doing for the many peoples under her care and what\r\nthis nation is doing for the few outside our borders that we have in\r\nhand we might unitedly do for a great portion of the globe and its\r\ninhabitants. This combination must be strong enough to check certain\r\nhighwaymen in international relations and to install a wholesome regard\r\nfor human rights. Such an outcome of present friendliness will not be\r\nachieved in a day or generation. But it will come; it must come. Asia\r\nand the continent of Europe may become Chinese or Cossack, but the\r\nEnglish-speaking race shall rule over every other land and all the\r\nislands and every sea.\r\n\r\nThe present time is a critical period in the life of the American\r\nRepublic, and therefore in the life of the world. The impotence of the\r\nfederal government to stop strike disturbances, lynchings and\r\ndisfranchisements, the growing power of an oligarchial and plutocratic\r\nSenate, and the perils of imperialism are disquieting enough, but worst\r\nof all is the evil of party rule and party strife.\r\n\r\nWashington abhorred party and regarded it as a disease which he hoped to\r\navert by putting federalists and anti-federalists in his cabinet\r\ntogether. The intuition of the founders of the Republic was that the\r\npresident should be elected by a chosen body of select and responsible\r\ncitizens, but since the Jacksonian era, nomination and election have\r\nbeen completely in the hands of the Democracy at large, and the election\r\nhas been performed by a process of national agitation and conflict\r\nwhich sets at work all the forces of political intrigue and corruption\r\non the most enormous scale, besides filling the country with persons\r\nalmost as violent and anti-social as those of the Civil War.\r\n\r\nThe qualification for public office from that of president down to that\r\nof a member of a city council in national, state or city politics is not\r\na question of which man is most worthy of public confidence. It is no\r\nlonger eminence but availability. The great aim of each party is to\r\nprevent the country from being successfully governed by its rival. Each\r\nwill do anything to catch votes and anything rather than lose them.\r\nGovernment consequently is at the mercy of any organization which has\r\nvotes on a large scale to sell, or corporations that will freely\r\ncontribute its funds. The Grand Army of the Republic is thus enabled to\r\nlevy upon the nation tribute to the amount of a hundred and fifty\r\nmillion dollars each year, thirty-six years after the war, although\r\nGeneral Grant at the close of the war said that the pensions should\r\nnever exceed seven millions each year. And now both parties in their\r\nplatform promise their countenance to this exaction.\r\n\r\nThe recent exposures of the millions contributed by the trusts, tariff\r\nprotected industries, life insurance companies, etc., to the campaign\r\nfunds has astonished the world. The history of the most corrupt\r\nmonarchies could hardly furnish a more monstrous case of financial\r\nabuse, to say nothing of the effect upon national character.\r\n\r\nEach party machine has a standing army of wire pullers with an apparatus\r\nof intrigue and corruption to the support of which holders of office\r\nunder government are assessed. The boss is a recognized authority, and\r\nmastery of unscrupulous intrigue is his avowed qualification for his\r\nplace. The pest of partyism invades all the large cities of the country.\r\nNew York is made the plunder of the thieves of one party and\r\nPhiladelphia of thieves of the other. It is surely impossible that any\r\nnation should endure such a system forever. A nation which deliberately\r\ngives itself up to government by faction, under the name of party, signs\r\nits own doom. The end may be delayed but it is sure. The American people\r\nundoubtedly have the political wisdom and force to deal with this\r\ncrisis, but there is no evidence that these qualities are being brought\r\nto bear on the situation nor is there any great man arisen to lead the\r\nreform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PART II.\r\n\r\n                       BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES\r\n\r\n                               of the\r\n\r\n                    LOYALISTS OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\r\n                               with\r\n\r\n   THE ADDRESSES TO GOVERNOR HUTCHINSON. THE CONSPIRACY ACT; AND\r\n     RESOLUTION, RELATING TO THE BANISHING AND CONFISCATION OF THE\r\n     ESTATES OF THE ABSENTEES, AND REFUGEES, AND A LIST OF THE LOYALISTS\r\n     THAT WENT TO HALIFAX ON THE EVACUATION OF BOSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       The Loyalists of Massachusetts\r\n\r\nWHO WERE THE INHABITANTS OF THE NEW ENGLAND COLONIES AT THE TIME OF THE\r\n                                REVOLUTION?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first and second chapters of this work treated of the settlement of\r\nMassachusetts and the framing and establishing of that social system and\r\nform of government which through successive generations, the settlers\r\nand their descendants took part, which culminated in the Revolution. The\r\nfounders of Massachusetts and of all New England, were almost entirely\r\nEnglishmen. Their emigration to New England began in 1620, it was\r\ninconsiderable till 1630, at the end of ten years more it almost ceased.\r\nA people consisting at that time of not many more than twenty thousand\r\npersons, thenceforward multiplied on its own soil, in remarkable\r\nseclusion from other communities, for nearly two centuries. Such\r\nexceptions to this statement are of small account. In 1651 after the\r\nbattle of Dunbar, Cromwell sent some four or five hundred of his Scotch\r\nprisoners to Boston, but very little trace of this accession is left.\r\nAfter the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, about one hundred\r\nand fifty families of French Huguenots came to Massachusetts; their\r\nnames and a considerable number of their posterity are yet to be found.\r\nA hundred and twenty Scotch-Irish families, came over in 1719 and\r\nsettled in Boston, and New Hampshire. Some slight emigrations from it\r\ntook place at an early date, but they soon discontinued, and it was not\r\ntill after the Revolution that those swarms began to depart, which have\r\nsince occupied so large a portion of the territory of the United States.\r\nDuring that long period their identity was unimpaired. No race has ever\r\nbeen more homogeneous than this, at the outbreak of the Revolution, and\r\nfor many years later. Thus the people of New England was a singularly\r\nunmixed race. There was probably not a county in England occupied by a\r\npopulation of purer English blood than theirs. Down to the eve of the\r\nwar in 1775, New England had little knowledge of the communities which\r\ntook part in that conflict with her. Till the time of the Boston Port\r\nBill, Massachusetts and Virginia, the two principal English settlements,\r\nhad with each other scarcely more relations of acquaintance, business,\r\nmutual influence, or common action, than either of them had with Bermuda\r\nor Barbados.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the nineteenth century vast numbers of Irish,\r\nand next to them German, came to New England, so at the time of writing,\r\n1908, it is claimed that one half of the inhabitants of Boston are\r\nIrish, or of Irish parentage. During the past ten years the places of\r\nthe Irish are being taken by the Italians, Jews, Portuguese, Greeks,\r\nArmenians, French Canadians, and others. The reader will see from the\r\nforegoing that the contestants in Massachusetts during the Revolutionary\r\nwar were a race representing a peculiar type of the Englishmen of the\r\nseventeenth century who, sequestrated from foreign influences formed a\r\ndistinct character by their own discipline, and was engaged in a work\r\nwithin itself, on its own problem, through a century and a half, and\r\nwhich terminated in the Revolutionary War, that dismembered the Empire.\r\nThat the foregoing statement concerning the purity of the race at the\r\ntime of the Revolution is a correct one, is shown in the following\r\nbiographies of the Loyalists of Massachusetts, for in nearly every case\r\ntheir ancestry date back to that of the first settlers, through several\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE ADDRESSERS.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the following addressers is out of all proportion to\r\ntheir apparent significance. They are an indispensable genesis to the\r\nhistory of the Loyalists. For the next seven years the Addressers were\r\nheld up to their countrymen as traitors and enemies to their country. In\r\nthe arraignments, which soon began, the Loyalists were convicted not out\r\nof their mouths, but out of their addresses. The ink was hardly dry upon\r\nthe parchment before the persecution began against all those who would\r\nnot recant, and throughout the long years of the war, the crime of an\r\naddresser grew in its enormity, and they were exposed to the perils of\r\ntarring and feathering, the horrors of Simbury mines, a gaol or a\r\ngallows.\r\n\r\n\r\n             ADDRESS OF THE MERCHANTS AND OTHERS OF BOSTON\r\n                          TO GOV. HUTCHINSON.\r\n\r\n                                                _Boston_, May 30, 1774.\r\n\r\nWe, merchants and traders of the town of Boston, and others, do now wait\r\non you, in the most respectful manner, before your departure for\r\nEngland, to testify, for ourselves the entire satisfaction we feel at\r\nyour wise, zealous, and faithful administration, during the few years\r\nthat you have presided at the head of this province. Had your success\r\nbeen equal to your endeavors, and to the warmest wishes of your heart,\r\nwe cannot doubt that many of the evils under which we now suffer, would\r\nhave been averted, and that tranquility would have been restored to this\r\nlong divided province; but we assure ourselves that the want of success\r\nin those endeavors will not abate your good wishes when removed from\r\nus, or your earnest exertions still on every occasion to serve the true\r\ninterest of this your native country.\r\n\r\nWhile we lament the loss of so good a governor, we are greatly relieved\r\nthat his Majesty, in his gracious favor, hath appointed as your\r\nsuccessor a gentleman who, having distinguished himself in the long\r\ncommand he hath held in another department, gives us the most favorable\r\nprepossessions of his future administration.\r\n\r\nWe greatly deplore the calamities that are impending and will soon fall\r\non this metropolis, by the operation of a late act of Parliament for\r\nshutting up the port on the first of next month. You cannot but be\r\nsensible, sir, of the numberless evils that will ensue to the province\r\nin general, and the miseries and distresses into which it will\r\nparticularly involve this town, in the course of a few months. Without\r\nmeaning to arraign the justice of the British Parliament, we could\r\nhumbly wish that this act had been couched with less rigor, and that the\r\nexecution of it had been delayed to a more distant time, that the people\r\nmight have had the alternative either to have complied with the\r\nconditions therein set forth, or to have submitted to the consequent\r\nevils on refusal; but as it now stands, all choice is precluded, and\r\nhowever disposed to compliance or concession the people may be, they\r\nmust unavoidably suffer very great calamities before they can receive\r\nrelief. Making restitution for damage done to the property of the East\r\nIndia Company, or to the property of any individual, by the outrage of\r\nthe people, we acknowledge to be just; and though we have ever\r\ndisavowed, and do now solemnly bear our testimony against such lawless\r\nproceedings, yet, considering ourselves as members of the same\r\ncommunity, we are fully disposed to bear our proportions of those\r\ndamages, whenever the sum and the manner of laying it can be\r\nascertained. We earnestly request that you, sir, who know our condition,\r\nand have at all times displayed the most benevolent disposition towards\r\nus, will, on your arrival in England, interest yourself in our behalf,\r\nand make such favorable representations of our case, as that we may hope\r\nto obtain speedy and effectual relief.\r\n\r\nMay you enjoy a pleasant passage to England; and under all the\r\nmortifications you have patiently endured, may you possess the inward\r\nand consolatory testimonies of having discharged your trust with\r\nfidelity and honor, and receive those distinguishing marks of his\r\nMajesty's royal approbation and favor, as may enable you to pass the\r\nremainder of your life in quietness and ease, and preserve your name\r\nwith honor to posterity.\r\n\r\n  William Blair,          John Greenlaw,            Theophilus Lillie,\r\n  James Selkrig,          Benjamin Clark,           Miles Whitworth,\r\n  Archibald Wilson,       William McAlpine,         James McEwen,\r\n  Jeremiah Green,         Jonathan Snelling,        William Codner,\r\n  Samuel H.

And we do now further, declare, that we never\r\nintended the offence which this address occasioned; that if we had\r\nforeseen such an event we should never have signed it; as it always has\r\nbeen and now is our wish to live in harmony with our neighbors, and our\r\nserious determination is to promote to the utmost of our power the\r\nliberty, the welfare, and happiness of our country, which is inseparably\r\nconnected with our own.\r\n\r\n  John Nutting,        N.

Davenport Miller and How were taken to\r\nTask by the Town Meeting for having signed the above address altho it\r\nwas never presented or published. They were required by next day to make\r\nan acknowledgement of their offence--And a Committee of fifteen was\r\nchosen to treat with them and Mr. Murray.\r\n\r\nSept. 22. These Culprits attended and made the following\r\nacknowledgement, of which the Committee accepted, requiring them to sign\r\nit and to read it severally before the Town Meeting on the green. This\r\ndone the Meeting by some Majority voted it not satisfactory. The\r\noffenders all but Capt.

Hutchinson a few\r\ndays before his Embarkation for England, which Address contained\r\nCompliments to the Gov. that we did and do still, in our consciences,\r\nbelieve to be justly due to him; and Whereas we did further believe that\r\nit would be very acceptable to the Town to give them such an Opportunity\r\nof showing their gratitude to the Governor.\r\n\r\nNow since the Temper of the Times is such, that what we meant to please\r\nhas eventually displeased our Neighbours, We, who desire to live in\r\npeace and good will with them are sorry for it. Witness our hands this\r\n22d. day of Sept. 1774.\r\n\r\n                                Signed\r\n\r\n                JA. MURRAY  SAML.

No public man of this State was ever subject\r\nto more slander, personal abuse, and misrepresentation than he, and no\r\nson of Massachusetts ever did so much to benefit and advance the best\r\ninterests of the State; beyond all question he was the greatest and most\r\nfamous man Massachusetts has ever produced.\r\n\r\nDescended from one of the oldest and most noted of Massachusetts\r\nfamilies, he was not one of the first members of it to acquire\r\nprominence, that distinction belongs to the celebrated Ann Hutchinson,\r\nwife of William Hutchinson who came over in 1634, \"that woman of ready\r\nwit and bold spirit,\" more than a match for her reverend and magisterial\r\ninquisitors, and who won to her side men even of such power as John\r\nCotton and Sir Henry Vane. She was finally banished and with her\r\nfollowers went to live under the protection of the Dutch, at Long Island\r\nwhere she and all of her family except one child were killed by the\r\nIndians[102], her husband having died the year previous.[103] Her\r\ngrandson, Elisha Hutchinson, became the first chief justice under the\r\nold charter and afterwards assistant and commander of the town of\r\nBoston. His son, Col. Thomas Hutchinson, was of scarcely less note. He\r\nit was who seized Captain Kidd when he resisted the officers of justice\r\nsent against him, and was the father of Governor Thomas Hutchinson. He\r\nwas a wealthy merchant, and councillor who made his native town a sharer\r\nin his prosperity by founding the North End Grammar School. He lived in\r\nthe North Square in the finest house in Boston. Here his son, the future\r\ngovernor, was born Sept. 9, 1711 and the two, father and son, occupied\r\nit for more than sixty years, till it was sacked by the mob in 1765.\r\n\r\n  [102] This was Colonel Edward H. Hutchinson who was killed by the\r\n  Indians during King Philip's war. He was father of Elisha Hutchinson.\r\n\r\n  [103] William Hutchinson was the first grantee of East Milton, where the\r\n  Governor afterwards resided. He settled in Boston on the \"Old Corner\r\n  Bookstore\" lot, corner of School and Washington streets. William\r\n  Hutchinson was the grandson of John Hutchinson, Mayor of Lincoln,\r\n  England.\r\n\r\nWhen five and a half years old the boy was sent to the school\r\nestablished by his father, and at the age of twelve went thence to\r\nHarvard College. He graduated in 1727, and three years after he took the\r\ndegree of Master of Arts. He then became a merchant--apprentice in his\r\nfather's counting room. At the age of twenty-one, he had amassed by his\r\nown efforts L500. He married Margaret Sanford, daughter of the Governor\r\nof Rhode Island. In 1735 he joined the church, in 1737 he became\r\nselectman of Boston, and four months later, was elected Representative\r\nto the General Court. At the age of twenty-six, he entered upon his\r\nwonderful career, so strangely and sadly varied. When he stepped into\r\nleadership, he seemed simply to come to his own, for since the\r\nfoundation of Massachusetts Bay there had been no time when some of his\r\nname and line had not been in the front.\r\n\r\nFrom the first he is set to deal with questions of finance; as early as\r\nJune 3, 1737, he is appointed to wrestle with a tax bill, and before the\r\nend of the year he is settling a boundary dispute with New Hampshire,\r\nand it was a mark of confidence when in 1740 he was appointed, being\r\nthen 29, to go to England to represent the case to men in power. A far\r\nmore memorable service than this had already been entered upon by him,\r\nand was resumed upon his return in which he was thoroughly successful in\r\nspite of great difficulties, it also having a close relation with the\r\ncoming into being of the United States.\r\n\r\nNew England was at this time cursed with an irredeemable paper currency.\r\nDemocracies never appear to so poor advantage as in the management of\r\nfinances, and no more conspicuous instance in point can be cited, than\r\nthat of provincial New England, throughout the first half of the 18th\r\ncentury. The Assembly, the members of which were simply the mouthpieces\r\nof the towns, surrendered their private judgment and became submissive\r\nto the \"Instruction\" which they received at the time of their election,\r\nwas uniformly by a large majority, in favor of an irredeemable paper\r\ncurrency. Before the enormous evils which early became apparent and\r\nconstantly grew in magnitude, the Assembly was impotent. Widows and\r\norphans, classes dependent on fixed incomes, were reduced to distress,\r\ncreditors found themselves defrauded of their just dues, till almost\r\nnothing was left, a universal gambling spirit was promoted. The people\r\nsaw no way to meet the evil but by new, and ever new issues of the\r\nwretched script, until with utter callousness of conscience, men\r\nrepudiated contracts voluntarily entered upon, and recklessly discounted\r\nthe resources of future generations by placing upon them the obligations\r\ntheir own shoulders should have borne. The action of the Council in\r\nwhich the higher class was represented was uniformly more wise, and\r\nhonorable, than that of the lower House during this period of financial\r\ndistress, and it is especially to be noted that King and Parliament\r\nthrew their influence on the right side, and sought repeatedly to save\r\nthe poor blind people from themselves. The right of the home government\r\nto interfere in colonial affairs was then never questioned.\r\nMassachusetts would dodge if she could, the government mandates, but the\r\ntheories of a later time, that Parliament had no jurisdiction over sea\r\nand that the King, having granted the charter, had put it out of his\r\npower to touch the provincial policy, in these days found no expression.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution was now preparing, the Colonies were chafing under\r\nrestrictions imposed beyond the ocean for their own benefit. It is now\r\ngenerally admitted, that this was one of the first causes of the\r\nRevolution, perhaps the most potent of all causes. In all this time of\r\ndistress no figure is apparent so marked with traits of greatness as\r\nthat of Thomas Hutchinson. All the Colonies were infected with the same\r\ncraze, but no other man in America saw the way out. Franklin, level\r\nheaded though he was, elaborately advocated paper money, turning a good\r\npenny in its manufacture.[104] The father of Samuel Adams was one of the\r\ndirectors of the iniquitous \"Land Bank\" and the part taken by Hutchinson\r\nin causing Parliament to close it, was what led to the undying hatred of\r\nSamuel Adams towards Hutchinson, and the Government. When \"Instructions\"\r\nwere reported in Town Meeting, Hutchinson was immediately on his feet,\r\nand declared he would not observe them, there were immediately cries\r\n\"Choose another Representative.\" This could not be done during the\r\nsession; he consistently threw his influence on the hard money side, and\r\nso far lost popularity that he was dropped in 1739. He was, however,\r\nelected again in 1742, and was Speaker in 1746-7-8.\r\n\r\n  [104] A Modest Inquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper\r\n  Currency.\r\n\r\nWhat saved the province from financial ruin at this time was the capture\r\nof Louisburg. This warlike enterprise of Shirley led the country to\r\nincrease its debt to between two and three million dollars, but the\r\npaper money was so depreciated at the close of the war that L1,200 was\r\nequal to only L100 sterling. Parliament very generously voted to\r\nreimburse the Province for the expense it had gone to in this war, and\r\nvoted to pay L183,649, 2s 7 1-2d sterling.\r\n\r\nMr. Hutchinson, who was then Speaker of the House of Representatives,\r\nconsidered this to be a most favorable opportunity for abolishing bills\r\nof credit, the source of so much iniquity, and for establishing a stable\r\ncurrency of gold and silver for the future. L2,200,000 would be\r\noutstanding in bills in the year 1749 L180,000 sterling at eleven for\r\none, which was the rate at that time, would redeem all but L220,000. It\r\nwas therefore proposed that Parliament should ship to the Province\r\nSpanish dollars, and apply same to redeem the bills, and that the\r\nremainder of the bills should be met by a tax on the year 1749. This\r\nwould finish the bills. The Governor approved of the bill prepared by\r\nMr. Hutchinson but when the Speaker laid the proposal before the House,\r\nit was received with a smile; for a long time the fight was hopeless,\r\nmany weeks were spent in debating it.\r\n\r\nThe large class of debtors preferred paper to anything more solid.\r\nOthers claimed that though the plan might have merit, the bills must be\r\nput an end to in a gradual way, a \"fatal shock\" would be felt by so\r\nsudden a return to a specie basis. When the vote was taken the bill was\r\ndecisively rejected. The chance of escaping from bondage seemed to be\r\nirrecoverably gone. A motion to reconsider having been carried, the\r\nconviction overtook some men of influence, and the bill for a wonder\r\npassed. The Governor and Council were prompt to ratify, and while the\r\npeople marvelled, it was done. The streets were filled with angry men\r\nand when it was reported that Hutchinson's home was on fire there were\r\ncries in the street \"Curse him, let it burn.\" His fine home at Milton, a\r\nrecent purchase, many thought should be protected by a guard. The\r\ninfatuation was so great, the wish was often expressed that the ship\r\nbringing the treasure might sink. Many doubted whether the treasure\r\nwould really be sent, and this uncertainty perhaps helped the adoption\r\nof the bill.\r\n\r\nBut the treasure came, seventeen trucks were required to cart from the\r\nship to the Treasury, two hundred and seventeen chests of Spanish\r\ndollars, while ten trucks, conveyed one hundred casks of coined copper.\r\nAt once a favorable change took place. There was no _shock_ but of the\r\npleasantest kind, a revulsion of popular feeling followed speedily,\r\nuntil Hutchinson, from being threatened at every street corner, became a\r\nthorough favorite. Twelve years after this time Hutchinson wrote, \"I\r\nthink I may be allowed to call myself the father of the present fixed\r\nmedium.\" There is no doubt of it. He alone saw the way out of the\r\ndifficulty, and nothing but his tact, and persistency, pushed the\r\nmeasure to success. This is admitted by his enemy, John Adams, who\r\nthirty years after Hutchinson's death said, \"If I was the witch of\r\nEndor, I would wake the ghost of Hutchinson, and give him absolute power\r\nover the currency of the United States, and every part of it, provided\r\nalways that he should meddle with nothing but the currency. As little as\r\nI revere his memory, I will acknowledge that he understood the subject\r\nof coin and commerce better than any man I ever knew in this country. He\r\nwas a merchant, and there can be no scientific merchant, without a\r\nperfect knowledge of a theory of a medium of trade.\"[105] Hutchinson, in\r\nthe third volume of his history of Massachusetts, remarks that the\r\npeople of Massachusetts Bay were never more easy and happy, than in 1749\r\nwhen, through the application of the Louisburg reimbursement to the\r\nextinction of the irredeemable bills, the currency was in an excellent\r\ncondition. It excited the envy of the other colonies where paper was the\r\nprincipal currency.\r\n\r\n  [105] Curwen's Journal p. 456.\r\n\r\nIn 1750 he was again elected to the Assembly and \"he was praised as much\r\nfor his firm\" as he had before been abused for \"his obstinate\r\nperseverance.\" He was made chairman of a commission to negotiate a\r\ntreaty with the Indians of Casco Bay. He also settled the boundary\r\nquestion with Connecticut, and Rhode Island, as he had done previously\r\nwith New Hampshire. Massachusetts became greatly the gainer by this\r\nsettlement of its boundaries. The present boundaries of Massachusetts\r\nare those established by Hutchinson. In 1752 he was appointed Judge of\r\nProbate, and Justice of the Common Pleas, for the County of Suffolk. In\r\nthe spring of 1754 he lost his wife. With her dying voice and with eyes\r\nfixed on him she uttered three words, \"Best of husbands.\" He loved her\r\ntenderly; twenty years later, taking thought for her grave, as we shall\r\nsee later on in this article (where his countrymen could not let her\r\nbones rest in peace, but they must desecrate her grave on Copps Hill.)\r\n\r\n\"In 1754 he was sent as delegate to the Convention held in Albany, for\r\nthe purpose of Confederating the Colonies, the better to protect\r\nthemselves from the French. Hutchinson and Franklin were the leading\r\nminds of the body. To these two the preparation of important papers was\r\nconfided and plans made to prevent the 'French from driving the English\r\ninto the sea.'\"\r\n\r\nIn 1758 Hutchinson became Lieutenant Governor. The excellent financial\r\ncondition produced by Hutchinson's measure ten years previous, still\r\ncontinued, and was made even better than before. Quebec had fallen, and\r\nCanada was conquered by the English, and the mother country, made\r\ngenerous by success, sent over large sums of money to reimburse the\r\nColonies for the share they had taken in bringing about the brilliant\r\nsuccess, the result was that the taxes became a burden of the lightest\r\never before known.\r\n\r\nIn 1760 Chief Justice Sewall died. Hutchinson was appointed his\r\nsuccessor by Governor Bernard. James Otis, Sr., then Speaker of the\r\nAssembly, desired the place. James Otis, Jr., a young vigorous lawyer,\r\nwho was soon to arrive at great distinction, vigorously espoused his\r\nfather's cause. Hutchinson warned the Governor of trouble, in case the\r\nOtises were disappointed. Bernard however, saw the risk of this, and\r\ndeclared he would in no case appoint Otis, but named Hutchinson instead.\r\nAt once the younger Otis vowed vengence, a threat which he soon after\r\nproceeded to execute by embarrassing the Governor, including the new\r\nChief Justice also in his enmity. Though before friends of government,\r\nthe Otises now became its opposers, and as the younger man presently\r\ndeveloped power as an unequalled popular leader, he became a most\r\ndangerous foe. \"From so small a spark,\" exclaimed Hutchinson, \"a great\r\nfire seems to have been kindled.\" Henceforth the two men are to have no\r\nfeelings for each other, but dread and hatred. An agitation began\r\nbetween these two men, destined before it closes, to affect most\r\nprofoundly the history of the whole future human race.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1761, Hutchinson just warming to his work as Chief Justice,\r\nwas a principal figure in the disturbance about \"Writs of Assistance\" or\r\n\"Search Warrants.\" The customs taxes were evaded the whole country over,\r\nin a way most demoralizing. The warehouses were few indeed in which\r\nthere were no smuggled goods. The measures taken for tariff enforcement\r\nwere no more objectionable than those employed today. Freedom to be sure\r\nis outraged when a custom-officer invades a man's house, his castle, but\r\nhigh tariff cannot exist without outrages upon freedom. A change had\r\ncome about; the government had declared the laws must be enforced, and\r\nit lay upon Hutchinson to interpret the laws and see to this\r\nenforcement. The position of the Chief Justice was an embarrassing one.\r\nHis own proclivities were for free trade; his friends had been concerned\r\nin contraband commerce, according to the universal practice in the term\r\nof slack administration. Hutchinson was as yet a novice in the Chief\r\nJusticeship, but he made no mistake in postponing his decision, and have\r\nthe Court wait till the English practice could be known. When news came\r\nfrom England, a form was settled on as near to that employed in England,\r\nas circumstances would permit. Writs were issued to custom-house\r\nofficers, for which application should be made to the Chief Justice by\r\nthe Surveyor-General of the customs.[106] Before this determination was\r\nreached James Otis made his memorable plea against \"Writs of\r\nAssistance,\" one of the epoch-making events in the history of America.\r\nJohn Adams afterward said, \"I do say in the most solemn manner, that Mr.\r\nOtis's oration against Writs of Assistance breathed into this nation the\r\nbreath of life.\"\r\n\r\n  [106] For further matter concerning the Writs of Assistance and James\r\n  Otis see p. 34.\r\n\r\nHutchison's popularity from now begins to wane, and the main hand in\r\nthis was no doubt the teachings of James Otis whose phrase \"no taxation\r\nwithout representation\" was used as a rallying cry. Boston at once\r\nelected him as its Representative in the Assembly, and his leadership\r\nthus was scarcely broken even when he became insane. At last he became a\r\ngreat embarrassment to his party, from the fact that, although his wits\r\nwere gone, the people would still follow him. Peter Oliver, who\r\nsucceeded Hutchinson as Chief Justice is quoted by John Adams as saying\r\nto him, that Otis would at one time declare of the Lieutenant Governor,\r\n\"that he would rather have him than any man he knows in any office\"; and\r\nthe next hour represent him as \"the greatest tyrant and most despicable\r\ncreature living.\"[107]\r\n\r\n  [107] Adams' Diary, June 5th, 1762.\r\n\r\nHutchinson was now known as a \"prerogative man,\" ready to defer to the\r\nhome government in important things, but there was as yet no definite\r\nline drawn between prerogative men and patriots. Otis always scouted the\r\nidea of independence of the Colonies as disloyal folly, his successor,\r\nSamuel Adams, was the first to preach disloyalty and secession. Otis, as\r\nModerator in Town Meeting in Boston, in 1763, spoke eloquently of the\r\nBritish empire and constitution. He said, \"The true interests of Great\r\nBritain and her plantations are mutual, and what God in his providence\r\nhas united, let no man dare pull asunder.\" As to parliamentary\r\nsupremacy, Otis was much more emphatic than Hutchinson. He said, \"the\r\npower of Parliament is uncontrollable, but by themselves, and we must\r\nobey. Forcibly resisting the Parliament and the King's laws is high\r\ntreason. Therefore let the Parliament lay what burdens they please upon\r\nus; we must, it is our duty, to submit, and patiently to bear them till\r\nthey will be pleased to relieve us.\"[108]\r\n\r\n  [108] Rights of the British Colonies.\r\n\r\nOtis conceded to Parliament supremacy, but insisted that the Colonies\r\nshould have representatives there. Hutchinson considered representation\r\nthere impracticable, and while conceding supremacy, thought it should be\r\nkept well in the background, while the Colonies managed for themselves.\r\nGreat Britain has really always held to this position even to the\r\npresent day--\"Although the general rule is that the legislative assembly\r\nhas the sole right of imposing taxes in the Colony, yet when the\r\nimperial legislature chooses to impose taxes according to the rule of\r\nlaw they have a right to do it.\" So decided the English judge Blackburn\r\nin 1868 in a case when Jamaica was involved.[109] Mansfield's position\r\nthat the Colonies were _virtually_ represented in Parliament was an\r\nentirely reasonable one. Parliamentary supremacy in the British empire\r\nis, indeed kept well in the background at the present moment, but let\r\nany great emergency arise, such as some peril to the mother country. If\r\nthe Colony should remain apathetic, or in any way render aid and comfort\r\nto the enemy, the dependency would be as arbitrarily ridden over by the\r\nfleets, and armies, as in the days of George III. So long as America\r\nremained dependent, parliamentary supremacy was necessary. It would only\r\nbe got rid of by such a declaration as that of 1776. This, Hutchinson\r\nwas not ready for nor any other person in the Colonies until many years\r\nafter this time, except one man, Samuel Adams, who said taxation without\r\nrepresentation was tyranny and representation was impossible.\r\n\r\n  [109] Yonge Const. His. of Eng. p. 66. See also Todd, Parl. Gov. in the\r\n  British Colonies 1899.\r\n\r\nThe correctness of the position of Hutchinson in the case of the Writs\r\nof Assistance have been maintained and exhibited in detail by so high an\r\nauthority as the late Horace Gray, Esq., for many years Chief Justice of\r\nthe Supreme Court of Massachusetts and at the time of his decease\r\njustice of the Supreme Court of the United States.[110] A currency\r\ndispute took place in 1762 as regards the parity between gold and\r\nsilver. Hutchinson represented the Council and Otis the House, the\r\nformer, true to the policy which had already been of such advantage, set\r\nhimself once more against a course certain to lead to a disastrous\r\ndepreciation. This financial controversy led to further unpopularity,\r\nand lost him not only a great number of friends, but the House while\r\nreducing the allowance to the Superior Court in general, refused to make\r\nany allowance to him whatever as Chief Justice. After the great war with\r\nFrance, which was waged mainly for the benefit of the Colonies, it was\r\nfound that England had a debt of L140,000,000 instead of L70,000,000\r\nwhich it had before the war. England also had paid the Colonies vast\r\nsums of money as previously stated, expenses incurred in protecting\r\nthemselves from the French. The American civil and military\r\nestablishments before the war was L70,000 per annum, it was now\r\nL350,000. George Grenville, Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that the\r\nColonies ought to contribute towards it; he did not expect them to raise\r\nthe whole, but a portion of it, and did not intend to charge them with\r\nany interest on the national debt, although it was largely incurred on\r\ntheir behalf.\r\n\r\n  [110] See Quincy, Massachusetts Reports 1761-1772. Appendix 1.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1765, he laid a bill before Parliament for further\r\ndefraying the expenses of protecting the colonies and he proposed to\r\ncharge certain stamp duties in said colonies. The agents of the several\r\ncolonies had an interview with him and tried to dissuade him from it. He\r\nreplied that he had considered the whole case and believed the colonies\r\nshould contribute something to the mother country to pay for their\r\nprotection, every penny of which would be spent in the colonies, and\r\nthat he knew of no better way than a stamp tax. \"If,\" he said, \"you can\r\ntell of a better, I will adopt it.\" Benjamin Franklin, proposed that the\r\ndemand for money should be made in the old constitutional way in the\r\nform of a requisition to the Assembly of each province. Can you agree,\r\nrejoined Grenville, on the proportion that each colony should raise. The\r\nquestion touched the heart of the difficulty, the agents were obliged to\r\nanswer in the negative, and the interview speedily closed, a few days\r\nlater the fatal Bill passed,--one of the most momentous legislative Acts\r\nin the history of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe position of Hutchinson was a trying one; he favored neither the\r\nissuance of the Writs of Assistance nor the Stamp Act. The whole course\r\nof the government he disapproved of he had been ready to cross the ocean\r\nto remonstrate for the Colony, against the impolitic treatment. On the\r\nother hand, the disloyal tone which daily grew rife about him, was\r\nutterly against his mind, he saw no outcome for it but independence, a\r\nmost wise forecasting of the situation, in fact there was no middle\r\nground. Independence seemed to him and to every man then, except Sam\r\nAdams, a calamity. If that was to be avoided, there was nothing for it\r\nbut to admit the supremacy of Parliament.[111] But the Province, to\r\nwhich he had been like a father, was growing away from him, and before\r\nthe summer ended, he was to receive a blow as ruthless, and ungrateful,\r\nas it was possible to give. He was at this time a Judge of the highest\r\nJudicial Court, a member of the Council, and Lieutenant Governor at the\r\nsame time. He had performed the duties of these incompatible offices to\r\nthe satisfaction of the community, as is shown in the writings of John\r\nAdams before he became Hutchinson's enemy. He says, \"Has not his merits\r\nbeen sounded very high by his countrymen for twenty years? Have not his\r\ncountrymen loved, admired, revered, rewarded, nay, almost adored him?\r\nHave not ninety-nine in a hundred of them really thought him the\r\ngreatest and best man in America? Has not the perpetual language of many\r\nmembers of both Houses and of a majority of his brother-counselors been,\r\nthat Mr. Hutchinson is a great man, a pious, a wise, a learned, a good\r\nman, an eminent saint, a philosopher etc? Nay, have not the affections\r\nand the admiration of his countrymen arisen so high as often to style\r\nhim the greatest and best man in the world, that they never saw, nor\r\nheard, nor read of such a man--a sort of apotheosis like that of\r\nAlexander and that of Caesar while they lived?\"[112]\r\n\r\n  [111] For further information concerning the Stamp Act, see p. 37.\r\n\r\n  [112] John Adams, Diary, March 17, 1766.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to give a more glowing eulogy in the English language\r\nof a person, than this written by John Adams, the successor of\r\nWashington as second President of the United States, but it could\r\nscarcely be less. The regularity of his life, his sympathy for the\r\ndistressed, his affability, his integrity, his industry, his talents for\r\nbusiness, and the administration of affairs, his fluency, and grace, as\r\npublic speaker. His command of temper, and courteousness under\r\nprovocation, united to form a rare man, and to give him influence. In a\r\ncountry where literary enterprise was very uncommon, he had devoted a\r\ngreat part of his life to investigating the history of his native\r\nprovince, busy though he was in so many places, in behalf of the public,\r\nhe found time to carry it forward. In 1764 was published in Boston the\r\nfirst volume of his \"History of Massachusetts Bay,\" a carefully studied\r\nwork quite unparalleled in the meagre colonial literature, and is still,\r\nand will always remain, of the first authority respecting the beginning\r\nof New England. In 1767 came the second volume. He had access to\r\noriginal papers such as no person now possesses which were of the\r\nhighest historical value. Writing to a friend in England in 1765, he\r\nsaid, \"I think from my beginning the work until I had completed it,\r\nwhich was about twelve months, I never had time to write two sheets at a\r\nsitting without avocations by public business, but forced to steal a\r\nlittle time in the morning and evening while I was in town, and leave it\r\nfor weeks together so I found it difficult to keep any plan in my mind.\"\r\n\r\nIn his third volume, written twenty years later and not published till\r\n1828, more than forty years after his death, the heat of the fight is\r\nstill in the heart beating behind the pen, in painting the portraits of\r\nhis contemporaries. Otis, Sam Adams, Hancock and others, the men who\r\nbore him down after the fiercest possible struggle. His portrait drawing\r\nis by no means without candor, and one wonders that the picture is no\r\ndarker. His presentment is always clear and dignified; his judgment of\r\nmen and events are just. It is the work of the thoughtful brain whose\r\ncomments on politics, finance, religion, etc., are full of intelligence\r\nand humanity.\r\n\r\nAnd now Hutchinson approaches the most crucial period of his life. As\r\nseen in a previous chapter after the passing of the Stamp Act, and the\r\nadoption of the Patrick Henry Resolves, the people grew riotous and\r\ntreason was talked of openly. The first great riot was on August 14,\r\n1765. In the morning the effigies of Andrew Oliver, the Stamp agent, and\r\nLord Bute the former prime minister, were hung on an elm tree, on the\r\ncorner of what is now Washington and Essex streets, in the evening they\r\nwere taken down, carried as far as Kilby street, where a new government\r\nbuilding was torn down by the mob, who, taking portions of the wood-work\r\nwith them, proceeded to Fort Hill, where they burnt the effigies in\r\nfront of the home of Mr. Oliver and committed gross outrages on his\r\npremises which were plundered and wrecked.[113]\r\n\r\n  [113] See page 40 for a more full description.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 26th the riots recommenced with redoubled fury.\r\nLieutenant Governor Hutchinson, also Chief Justice, the second person in\r\nrank in the colony and a kinsman of Oliver, was made a mark for the most\r\nunmeasured outrage. The story is best told in the words of the victim in\r\na letter to a friend.\r\n\r\n     To Richard Jackson,                    Boston, Aug. 30, 1765.\r\n\r\n     My Dear Sir--I came from my house at Milton the 26 in the morning.\r\n     After dinner it was whispered in the town there would be a mob at\r\n     night, and that Paxton, Hallowell, the custom house, and admiralty\r\n     officers' houses would be attacked; but my friends assured me that\r\n     the rabble were satisfied with the insult I had received, and that\r\n     I was become rather popular. In the evening, whilst I was at supper\r\n     and my children round me, somebody ran in and said the mob were\r\n     coming. I directed my children to fly to a secure place, and shut\r\n     up my house as I had done before, intending not to quit it; but my\r\n     eldest daughter repented her leaving me, hastened back and\r\n     protested that she would not quit the house unless I did. I\r\n     couldn't stand against this, and withdrew with her to a neighboring\r\n     house, where I had been but a few minutes before the hellish crew\r\n     fell upon my house with the rage of devils, and in a moment with\r\n     axes split down the doors and entered. My son being in the great\r\n     entry heard them cry 'Dam him, he is upstairs, we'll have him.'\r\n     Some ran immediately as high as the top of the house, then filled\r\n     the rooms below and the cellar, and others remained without the\r\n     house to be employed there. Messages soon came one after another to\r\n     the house where I was to inform me the mob were coming in pursuit\r\n     of me, and I was obliged to retire through yards and gardens to a\r\n     house more remote, where I remained until 4 o'clock, by which time\r\n     one of the best finished houses in the Province had nothing\r\n     remaining but the bare walls and floors.\r\n\r\n     Not content with tearing off all the wainscot and hangings, and\r\n     splitting the doors to pieces, they beat down the partition walls;\r\n     and although that alone cost them near two hours, they cut down the\r\n     cupola or lanthorn and they began to take the slate and boards from\r\n     the roof, and were prevented only by the approaching daylight from\r\n     a total demolition of the building. The garden house was laid flat,\r\n     and all my trees, etc., broke down to the ground. Such ruin was\r\n     never seen in America. Besides my plate and family pictures,\r\n     household furniture of every kind, my own, my children, and\r\n     servants, apparel, they carried off about L900 sterling in money\r\n     and emptied the house of everything whatsoever, except a part of\r\n     the kitchen furniture, not leaving a single book or paper in it,\r\n     and have scattered or destroyed all the manuscripts and other\r\n     papers I had been collecting for thirty years together, besides a\r\n     great number of public papers in my custody. The next evening, I\r\n     intended to go to Milton with my children, but meeting two or three\r\n     small parties of the ruffians who I suppose had concealed\r\n     themselves in the country, and my coachman hearing one of them\r\n     say, 'There he is'! my daughters were terrified, and said they\r\n     should never be safe, and I was forced to shelter them that night\r\n     at the Castle.[114]\r\n\r\n  [114] Mass. His. Soc. Vol. XXVI, p. 146.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Governor Hutchinson's House Destroyed by the Mob.]\r\n\r\nJosiah Quincy, then twenty-one years old, writing in his diary Aug. 27,\r\n1765, says that Hutchinson's life \"it is more than probable, was saved\r\nby his giving way to his eldest daughter and leaving the house.\" He\r\ndescribed \"the coming into court the next day of the stripped Chief\r\nJustice, clothed in a manner which would have excited compassion from\r\nthe hardest heart. Such a man in such a station, thus habited, with\r\ntears starting from his eyes, and a countenance which strongly told the\r\ninward anguish of his soul,--what must an audience have felt, whose\r\ncompassion had before been moved by what they knew he had suffered, when\r\nthey heard him pronounce the following words which the agitation of his\r\nmind dictated, \"Gentlemen,--There not being a quorum of the Court\r\nwithout me, I am obliged to appear. Some apology is necessary for my\r\ndress; indeed, I had no other. Destitute of everything,--no other shirt;\r\nno other garment but what I have on; and not one in my whole family in a\r\nbetter situation than myself. The distress of a whole family around me,\r\nyoung and tender infants hanging about me, are infinitely more\r\ninsupportable than what I feel for myself, though I am obliged to borrow\r\npart of _this_ clothing.\r\n\r\n\"Sensible that I am innocent, that all the charges against me are false,\r\nI can't help feeling: and although I am not obliged to give an answer to\r\nall the questions that may be put to me by every lawless person, yet I\r\ncall God to witness--and I would not, for a thousand worlds, call my\r\nMaker to witness to a falsehood--I say I call my Maker to witness, that\r\nI never, in New England or Old, in Great Britain, or America, neither\r\ndirectly or indirectly, was aiding, assisting or supporting--in the\r\nleast promoting or encouraging--what is commonly called the Stamp Act;\r\nbut, on the contrary, did all in my power, and strove as much as in me\r\nlay, to prevent it. This is not declared through timidity, for I have\r\nnothing to fear. They can only take away my life, which is of but little\r\nvalue when deprived of all its comforts, all that was dear to me, and\r\nnothing surrounding me but the most pressing distress.\r\n\r\n\"I hope the eyes of the people will be opened, that they will see how\r\neasy it is for some designing, wicked man to spread false reports to\r\nraise suspicion and jealousies in the minds of the populace, and enrage\r\nthem against the innocent, but if guilty, this is not the way to\r\nproceed. The laws of our country are open to punish those who have\r\noffended. This destroying all peace and comfort and order of the\r\ncommunity--all will feel its effects; and all will see how easily the\r\npeople may be deluded, inflamed and carried away with madness against an\r\ninnocent man. I pray God give us better hearts.\" The Court then\r\nadjourned to October 15th.\r\n\r\nWhy Hutchinson should have fallen into such great disfavor, it is not\r\neasy to say. Gordon, a writer of Whig leaning, but a fair minded witness\r\nof all that occurred suggests that there were some who still\r\nentertaining rancor towards him for doing away with paper money in 1748,\r\nfor, as we have seen, his position in 1762 on the currency was not\r\npopular. Moreover the mob was led on to the house by a secret influence,\r\nwith a view to the destruction of certain public papers known to be\r\nthere relating to the grant of the New Plymouth Company on the Kennebec\r\nRiver.[115] Hutchinson himself speaks on having given rise to animosity\r\nagainst him for having taken certain depositions in the interest of\r\ngovernment, before him in his character of Chief Justice to which his\r\nname was signed. They were purely official acts; for the depositions he\r\nhad no responsibility whatever, but the unreasoning mass of the people\r\nconfused him with others. There was nothing in his course at the time of\r\nthe Writs of Assistance, at which the people needed to feel aggrieved.\r\nHe was with the people in opposing the external taxes, also in\r\ndisapproving the Stamp Act. Now that they were imposed, he to be sure\r\nthought nothing would answer but submission, but certainly in his\r\ndeclaration here he was nothing like so emphatic as James Otis, who\r\nstill remained the popular idol. Otis had said in May, \"It is the duty\r\nof all humbly and silently to acquiesce in all the decisions of the\r\nsupreme legislature.\" In private talk he was still more vigorous in his\r\nutterances. He said to Hallowell, \"That Parliament had a right to tax\r\nthe Colonies, and he was a d----d fool who denied it and that this\r\npeople never would be quiet till we had a Council from home, till our\r\ncharter was taken away, and till we had regular troops quartered upon\r\nus.\"[116] Hutchinson had never expressed his thoughts anywhere near so\r\ndefinitely as this.\r\n\r\n  [115] His. of Am. Rev., Vol. I., p. 180.\r\n\r\n  [116] John Adams' Diary, Jan. 16, 1776.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Boston and the Province were generally ashamed of the\r\noutrage upon Hutchinson, but the mob still dared to show its hand.\r\nThough in the first rush of feeling many of the rioters were sent to\r\njail, they were afterwards set free. The chief actor seems to have been\r\na shoemaker, named Mackintosh, who, though arrested, was presently\r\ndischarged; Hutchinson declares this was through the interference of men\r\nof good position, who feared that a confession from him would implicate\r\nthem. Hutchinson's demand of the legislature for compensation for the\r\ndestruction of his home, was at last effectual. He is said to have\r\nreceived L3,194, 17s. 6d., a fair indemnity. The Act had attached to it\r\nfor a \"rider\" pardon to all who had taken part in the disturbance\r\nconnected with the Stamp Act. Bernard hesitated to sign the Act; but was\r\nfinally induced to do so by his earnest wish to have Hutchinson receive\r\njustice. When the Act was sent to England, the King disallowed it; such\r\nlawlessness could not be condoned, even that a faithful official might\r\nreceive his rights. But the money had been paid before the news of the\r\nKing's displeasure arrived.\r\n\r\nA period of lawlessness now followed. Riots were absolutely unpunished,\r\nfor no jury would convict the rioters. Governor Bernard wrote that his\r\nposition was one of utter, and humiliating impotence, and that the first\r\ncondition of the maintenance of English authority in Massachusetts was\r\nto quarter a powerful military force at Boston.\r\n\r\nTwo regiments arrived Sept. 28, 1768. Shortly before their arrival the\r\npeople gathered together in an immense meeting, and voted that a\r\nstanding army could not be kept in the province without its consent. On\r\nthe arrival of the troops everything was done by the people to provoke\r\nand irritate them. A perfect reign of terror was directed against all\r\nwho supported the government. Soldiers could not appear in the streets\r\nwithout being the objects of the grossest insults. A press eminently\r\nscurrilous and vindictive was ceaselessly employed in abusing them. They\r\nhad become as Samuel Adams boasted 'the objects of the contempt even of\r\nwomen, and children.' Every offence they committed was maliciously\r\nexaggerated and vindictively prosecuted, while in the absence of\r\nmartial law, they were obliged to look passively on the most flagrant\r\ninsults to authority. At one time the \"Sons of liberty\" in a procession\r\na mile and a half long marched around the State House, to commemorate\r\ntheir riots against the Stamp Act, and met in the open fields to chant\r\ntheir \"liberty song\" and drink \"strong halters, firm blocks, and sharp\r\naxes, to such as deserve them.\" At another an informer, who was found\r\nguilty of giving information to revenue officers, was seized by a great\r\nmultitude, tarred and feathered, and led through the streets of Boston,\r\nwhich was illuminated in honor of the achievement.\r\n\r\nA printer who had dared to caricature the champions of freedom was\r\nobliged to flee from his house, to take refuge among the soldiers, and\r\nultimately to escape from Boston in disguise. Merchants who had ventured\r\nto import goods from England were compelled by mob violence to give them\r\nup to be destroyed, or to be re-embarked. A shopkeeper who sold some\r\nEnglish goods, found a post planted in the ground with a hand pointing\r\nto his door, and when a friend tried to remove it, he was stoned by a\r\nfierce mob through the streets. A popular minister delighted his\r\ncongregation by publicly praying \"that the Almighty would remove from\r\nBoston the English soldiers.\"[117]\r\n\r\n  [117] Lecky's Am. Rev. Chapt. XI., p. 127.\r\n\r\nThese outrages led to the so-called Boston Massacre, more fully\r\ndescribed in a previous chapter.[118] None of the mobs of that time of\r\nmobs was more brutal and truculent than that which provoked the firing\r\nof the group of baited men, standing their ground with steady\r\ndiscipline, among the clubs and missiles resorted to now, to enforce the\r\nusual foul and blasphemous abuse. Lieutenant Governor Hutchinson\r\nfulfilled at this time with complete adequacy the functions of chief\r\nmagistrate, for Governor Bernard was at this time in England. Hutchinson\r\nwas at once in the street, in imminent danger of having his brains\r\ndashed out, expostulating, entreating that order might be\r\npreserved.[119] It was a fine exhibition of power and courage. His\r\nstanding in the east balcony of the State House, with the snow reddened\r\nbeneath by the blood of the killed, with the regiments kneeling in rank\r\nready for street firing, and several thousand of enraged men on the\r\nother side on the point of rushing into the fight, he was able to hold\r\nboth parties in check. His prompt arrest of Captain Preston and the\r\nsquad which had done the killing, was his full duty; and it is to the\r\ncredit of the troop that the officer and his men in the midst of the\r\nexasperation gave themselves quietly into the hands of the law. Instead\r\nof a bloody battle, there was substituted a well-ordered civil process,\r\ndue delay being observed that the passion of both sides might subside\r\nand the evidence, pro and con be calmly weighed. A mild and just verdict\r\nwas the outcome, to which all submitted. Men they were, all of the same\r\nstock, for the time being fallen into antagonism, seeing things\r\ndifferently. All, however, bore themselves like Englishmen, showing the\r\nquality which has made the Anglo-Saxon race a mighty one.\r\n\r\n  [118] Boston Mobs, page 43.\r\n\r\n  [119] Mass. A. His. Vol. XXXI., p. 491. Witness at the trial of the\r\n  soldiers said \"He stood close behind him, and one of the mob lifted up a\r\n  large club over my head, and was going to strike, but he seized him by\r\n  the arm and prevented it.\"\r\n\r\nSince the departure of Bernard there had been no session of the\r\nlegislature. In March one took place that was the cause of a new dispute\r\nbetween the Lieutenant Governor and the legislature, which was destined\r\nto be long and important. It was as to how far the chief magistrate\r\ncould be bound by royal instruction. Hutchinson says the Assembly was\r\nprorogued to meet at Boston March 14th, 1770, but before the time\r\narrived there came a further signification of the King's pleasure that\r\nit should be held at Cambridge, unless the Lieutenant Governor had more\r\nweighty reasons for holding it at Boston, than those which were\r\nmentioned by the Secretary of State against it.[120] On the 15th of\r\nMarch therefore the legislature met in the \"Philosophy Room\" in Harvard\r\nCollege, in Cambridge.\r\n\r\n  [120] Hutchinson His. Vol. III., p. 280.\r\n\r\nRemonstrances were passed by the Council and the House against the\r\nremoval to which Hutchinson replied \"That the King by his prerogative\r\ncould remove the legislature from the 'Town House in Boston' did not in\r\nhis mind admit of a doubt and therefore he disregarded the\r\nremonstrance.\" Soon after the Massacre, Hutchinson begged the Earl of\r\nHillsborough, the Colonial Secretary, to allow him to resign. He said,\r\n\"I must humbly pray that a person of superior powers of body and mind\r\nmay be appointed to the administration of the government of this\r\nProvince. I shall faithfully endeavor to support such person according\r\nto the best of my abilities, and I think it not improbable that I may be\r\ncapable of doing his Majesty greater service in the Province, even in a\r\nprivate station than at present.\"[121] Instead of accepting his\r\nresignation he was appointed Governor in March, 1771, and his wife's\r\nbrother-in-law, Andrew Oliver, being at the same time commissioned\r\nLieutenant Governor, and Thomas Flucker Secretary.\r\n\r\n  [121] M. A. Hist. Vol. XXVI., Mar. 27 to Hillsboro.\r\n\r\nAt his inauguration while the Assembly and the Congregational ministers\r\nwere silent, there were many congratulations, among them Harvard\r\nCollege. The students singing in Holden Chapel the anthem, \"Thus saith\r\nthe Lord from henceforth, behold! all nations shall call ye blessed; for\r\nthy rulers shall be of thine own kindred, your nobles shall be of\r\nyourself, and thy governors shall proceed from the midst of thee.\"\r\n\r\nApril 1, 1771, he writes to Colonel Williams of Hatfield. \"It's certain\r\nall the valuable part of the town have shown me as much respect\r\npersonally, as in my public character, as I could desire. Two Adamses,\r\nPhillips, Hancock, and two or three others, who, with the least reason\r\nhave been the most injurious, are all of any sort of consideration who\r\nstand out.\"[122] Again on April 19, 1771, in a letter to Hillsboro,\r\nreferring to the Town Meeting he says, \"In these votes, and in most of\r\nthe public proceedings of the town of Boston, persons of the best\r\ncharacter and estate have little or no concern. They decline attending\r\nTown Meetings where they are sure of being outvoted by men of the lowest\r\norder, all being admitted, and it being very rare that any scrutiny is\r\nmade into the qualification of voters.\"[123]\r\n\r\n  [122] M. A. Hist. Vol. XVII., p. 131.\r\n\r\n  [123] M. A. Hist. Vol. XXVII., p. 151.\r\n\r\nThe hopes Hutchinson and the friends of government were never brighter\r\nsince the troubles began with the government, than in the spring of\r\n1771. Among Hutchinson opponents men like Andrew Eliot, thought \"it\r\nmight be as well not to dispute the legal right of Parliament.\" Otis\r\ntoo, pursued a strong reactionary course and when on May 29 the\r\nlegislature met, at his instance, while the remonstrance was passed as\r\nhad become usual, against the removal of the legislature from Boston,\r\nthe clause was struck out which denied to the crown the right to remove.\r\nThe principle so long contended for was then sacrificed, the right of\r\nprerogative to infringe the charter at this point was acknowledged, and\r\nit would be easy to proceed on the ground that the crown might take what\r\nliberties it pleased with the charter. Otis's change was indeed\r\nstartling. Samuel Adams was going on in the old road, when Otis started\r\nup, and said they had gone far enough in that way, the Governor had an\r\nundoubted right to carry the court where he pleased, and moved for a\r\ncommittee to represent the inconveniences of sitting there, and for an\r\naddress to the Governor. He was a good man; the minister said so, and it\r\nmust be so: and moved to go on with the business, and the House voted\r\neverything he moved for.[124]\r\n\r\n  [124] John Adams' Works, Vol. II., p. 266.\r\n\r\n\"Serious as was the defection of James Otis that of Hancock was even\r\nmore so. His wealth, popular manners and some really strong qualities\r\nmade his influence great. Samuel Adams had exploited Hancock, with all\r\nhis consummate art ever since his appearance in public life, making him\r\na powerful pillar of the popular cause. Contemptuous allusions to\r\nHancock as little better than an ape, whom Samuel Adams led about\r\naccording to his will, have come down from those times.\"[125] Such\r\nthings were flying in the air and Hancock was feeble enough to be moved\r\nby them, if they came to his ears. Whatever may have been the reason,\r\nHancock forsook his old guide, voted with the party of Otis for the\r\nacknowledgment of Hutchinson's right to convene the legislature where\r\nand when he choose. Hancock's defection at this time from the Whig cause\r\nseemed imminent, and when Hutchinson fled to England, three years later\r\nand his papers fell into the hands of his enemies, it was found\r\nnecessary to suppress certain documents, belonging to this time as it is\r\nsupposed they compromised Hancock, who in 1774 was once more firmly on\r\nthe side of the Colonies.\r\n\r\n  [125] Hosmer's Life of Thomas Hutchinson p. 213.\r\n\r\nSamuel Adams probably never experienced a greater mortification than\r\nwhen, as a member of a committee, he waited, by command of the House,\r\nupon Hutchinson to present an address acknowledging the right of the\r\nGovernor to remove the General Court \"to Housantonic in the western part\r\nof the Province,\" if he desired, nor, on the other hand, did the\r\nGovernor ever enjoy a greater triumph. Hutchinson must have felt that he\r\nwas even with his chief adversary for the humiliation of the preceding\r\nyear, the driving out of the regiments. Adams felt his defeat keenly,\r\nbut gave no sign of it, he saw his influence apparently on the wane, but\r\nwas as unremitting as ever in his attempts to retrieve lost ground. But\r\nfor him the revolutionary cause at this time must have gone by the\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nThe revulsion was not long in coming. Before Hutchinson had time to\r\nrestore the repentant legislature to the town house in Boston, the\r\nhearts of the members became hardened against him. When it became known\r\nthat the decision of the king had been made for the support of the\r\nMassachusetts town officials from the revenue of the Colony by warrants\r\ndrawn on the Commission of Custom, the wrath of the people became heavy,\r\nand the voice of Samuel Adams led the discontented. The Governor was\r\npaid L1500 sterling, instead of L1000, annually, which he was paid when\r\ndependent on the people. Hutchinson now plainly announced that he should\r\nnow receive his salary from the King. The House protested in its usual\r\ntemper, the set of the opposition being so powerful that several of the\r\nLoyalists withdrew disheartened. But in the midst of the fault-finding\r\n\"Sons of Liberty\", he received a mark of confidence from the General\r\nCourt at which he was greatly pleased, as he had a right to be. We have\r\nalready seen him as the principal figure in settling the boundary lines\r\non the sides of New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Connecticut. The\r\nboundary line on the side of New York, not settled in 1767, and still in\r\ndispute, were equally in need of adjustment, and although his principles\r\nwere popularly denounced, and the scheme was already in progress which\r\nwas to drive him from his native land and deprive him of all his\r\npossessions in it, yet none but he could be trusted to undertake the\r\ndelicate negotiations upon which the welfare of the Province\r\ndepended.[126]\r\n\r\n  [126] The details are in Mass. Archives marked Colonial. Vol. IV. pp.\r\n  335-344.\r\n\r\nThe journal of the proceedings in the handwriting of the Governor, is\r\nstill extant. With William Brattle, Joseph Hawley, and John Hancock,\r\nHutchinson journeyed to Hartford, where on May 18, 1773, they discussed\r\nthe matter with Governor Tyron, John Watts, William Smith, R. R.\r\nLivingston, and William Nicoll, Commissioners from New York. The New\r\nYork men, although more compliant than the negotiators of seven years\r\nago, were still disposed to exact hard concessions, to which all the\r\ncommissioners but Hutchinson were about prepared to agree. Hutchinson,\r\nhowever, while diplomatic, was unyielding, insisting upon what had been\r\nsubstantially the demand of 1767. At last it was conceded, establishing\r\nfor all time as a part of the Bay State the beautiful county of\r\nBerkshire. This alone should entitle him to a monument by the State of\r\nMassachusetts. He alone, it is said, prevented the giving up by\r\nMassachusetts of her claim to western lands; these were retained and\r\nafterwards sold for a large sum.[127]\r\n\r\n  [127] N. E. His. and Gen Reg., Vol. I., p. 310.\r\n\r\nIt was a great victory for the Governor, the Massachusetts Commissioners\r\nhad been left free to do what seemed to them best, but they cordially\r\nacknowledged that success belonged to him.\r\n\r\nOn the return to Boston, the legislature was in session and the assembly\r\nauthorized him to transmit the settlement to Lord Dartmouth, Secretary\r\nof State, at once, without formally laying it before them. They trusted\r\nhim entirely. Hutchinson with some pride declared that \"no previous\r\ninstance of a like confidence of our Assembly in a Governor can be found\r\nin Massachusetts history.\"[128] This transient favor, and trust,\r\naggravated for him the force of the blow he was so soon to receive. How\r\nbitter the home coming of Hutchinson was, the following extract from a\r\nletter to Sir Francis Bernard, the late Governor will show:\r\n\r\n  [128] Hutchinson His. Vol. III., p. 391, 392.\r\n\r\nJune 29, 1773. \"After every other attempt to distress me they have at\r\nlast engaged in a conspiracy which has been managed with infinite art,\r\nand succeeded beyond their own expectation. They have buzzed about for\r\nthree or four months a story of something that would amaze everybody as\r\nsoon as the elections were over, it was said in the House something\r\nwould appear in eight and forty hours, which, if improved aright, the\r\nProvince might be as happy, as it was fourteen or fifteen years ago.\r\nThese things were spread through all the towns of the Province, and\r\neverybody's expectations were raised. At length upon motion the gallery\r\nwas ordered to be cleared and the doors shut. Mr. Samuel Adams informed\r\nthe House that seventeen original letters had been put in his hands,\r\nwritten to a gentleman in England by several persons from New England,\r\nwith an intention to subvert the constitution. They were delivered to\r\nhim on condition that they should be returned, not printed, and no\r\ncopies taken. If the House would receive them on these terms, he would\r\nread them. They broke through the pretended agreement, printed the\r\nresolves, and then the letters, which effrontery was never known before.\r\nThe letters are mere narratives which you well know to be true, as\r\nrespects remarks upon the Colonies, and such proposals as naturally\r\nfollow from the principles which I have openly avowed; but by every\r\nmalversation, which the talents of the party in each House, could\r\nproduce they have raised the prejudices of the people against me, and it\r\nis generally supposed all the writers were concerned in one plan, though\r\nI suppose no one of them ever saw or knew the contents of the letters of\r\nany others unless by accident.\"\r\n\r\nAfter three weeks spent, the House resolved to address the King, to\r\nremove the Governor and Lieutenant Governor.[129] The name of the person\r\nto whom the letters were written was erased from all of them, but they\r\nappear to be all Mr. Thomas Whatley's six from the Governor, four from\r\nthe Lieutenant-Governor, one from Rogers, and one from Auchmuty and the\r\nremainder from Rhode Island and Connecticut.\r\n\r\n  [129] M. A. His. Vol. XXVII., p. 502, etc.\r\n\r\nThe affair of the Hutchinson Letter created great excitement both in\r\nAmerica and England, an affair in which the best men of Massachusetts\r\nBay were concerned, including Franklin, then the agent of his native\r\nProvince, although a citizen then of Pennsylvania; a shade has rested\r\ntherefrom upon the character of Franklin, which cannot yet be said to\r\nhave been explained away. Is it creditable that those wary, able men,\r\nFranklin, Samuel Adams, Bowdoin, John Adams, Samuel Cooper, and others,\r\nreally thought the very quiet statements contained \"in the letters in\r\nwhich there was no sentiment which the Governor had not openly expressed\r\nin his addresses to the Legislature, was a danger and menace to the\r\nwelfare of the colony?\"[130] The only explanation is that they had\r\npersuaded themselves that Hutchinson was so dangerous that if conduct\r\nthoroughly above board would not answer, he must be cast out by\r\nquestionable means. Mr. Winthrop justifies their conduct by believing\r\nthat it may be classed among what Burke calls \"irregular things done in\r\nthe confusion of mighty troubles, not to be justified on\r\nprinciple.\"[130] When the printed copies of the letter arrived in\r\nEngland they excited great astonishment. Thomas Whatley was dead.\r\nWilliam Whatley, his brother, and executor was filled with a very\r\nnatural consternation, at a theft which was likely to have such\r\nimportant consequences, and for which public opinion was inclined to\r\nmake him responsible. He in turn suspected a certain Mr. Temple, who had\r\nbeen allowed to look through the papers of his deceased brother, for the\r\npurpose of perusing one relating to the colonies, and a duel ensued in\r\nwhich Whatley was severely wounded. Mr. Temple continued to be\r\nsuspected. A letter of Jan. 4, 1774, says: \"Although when they first\r\ncame abroad his own brother said: Whoever sent them was a d----d\r\nvillian.\"[131]\r\n\r\n  [130] New Eng. Hist. and Gen. Reg. I., p. 307.\r\n\r\n  [131] Hosmer's Life of Hutchinson, p. 274\r\n\r\nFranklin then for the first time, in a letter to a newspaper, disclosed\r\nthe part he had taken. He stated that \"he, and he alone, had obtained\r\nand transmitted to Boston the letters in question, that they had never\r\npassed into the hands of William Whatley, and that, therefore, it was\r\nimpossible, either that Whatley could have communicated them, or that\r\nTemple could have taken them, from his papers.\" There is some reason to\r\nbelieve that the original owner had left them carelessly in a public\r\noffice, whence they had been stolen, but the mystery was never\r\ndecisively solved.\r\n\r\n\"In England Franklin's conduct was regarded with the utmost severity.\r\nFor the purpose of ruining honorable officials it was said, their most\r\nconfidential letters, written years before to a private member of\r\nParliament, who had at that time no connection with Government, had been\r\ndeliberately stolen; although the original thief was undiscovered, the\r\nfull weight of the guilt and dishonor rested upon Franklin. He was\r\nperfectly aware that the letters had been written in the strictest\r\nconfidence, that they had been dishonestly obtained without the\r\nknowledge of the person who received them, or the person who wrote them,\r\nand that their exposure would be a deadly injury to the writers. Under\r\nthese circumstances he sent them to a small group of politicians whom he\r\nknew to be the bitterest enemies of the Governor, and one result was a\r\nduel in which the brother of the man whose private papers had been\r\nstolen, was nearly killed. Any man of high and sensitive honor, it was\r\nsaid, would sooner have put his hand into the fire than have been\r\nconcerned in such a transaction.\"[132]\r\n\r\n  [132] Lecky's Am. Rev., pp. 149, 150.\r\n\r\nWhen the petition for the removal of Hutchinson and Oliver arrived the\r\nGovernment referred it to the Committee of the Privy Council that the\r\nallegations might be publicly examined with counsel on either side. The\r\ncase exerted an intense interest which had been rarely paralleled. No\r\nless than thirty-five Privy Councillors attended; among the\r\ndistinguished strangers who crowded the Bar were Burke, Priestley and\r\nJeremy Bentham, Dunning and Lee, who spoke for the petitioners; they\r\nappear to have made no impression; while on the other side Wedderburn,\r\nthe Solicitor-General, made one of his most brilliant but most virulent\r\nspeeches, which was received with boundless applause.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief but eloquent eulogy of the character and services of\r\nHutchinson he passed to the manner in which the letters were procured,\r\nand turning to Franklin, who stood before him he delivered an invective\r\nwhich appeared to have electrified his audience. \"How the letters 'came\r\ninto the possession of anyone but the right owner's,'\" he said, \"is still\r\na mystery for Dr. Franklin to explain, and they could not have come into\r\nhis hands by fair means. Nothing will acquit Dr. Franklin of the charge\r\nof obtaining them by fraudulent or corrupt means, for the most malignant\r\nof purposes, unless he stole them from the person who stole them. I\r\nhope, my Lords, you will brand this man for the honor of this country,\r\nof Europe, and of mankind.... Into what country will the fabrication of\r\nthis iniquity hereafter go with unembarrassed face? Men will watch him\r\nwith a jealous eye. They will hide their papers from him, and lock up\r\ntheir escritoires. Having hitherto aspired after fame by his writings,\r\nhe will henceforth esteem it a libel to be called a man of\r\nletters--_homo trium literarum_. But, he not only took away those papers\r\nfrom our brother, he kept himself concealed, till he nearly occasioned\r\nthe murder of another. It is impossible to read his account, expressive\r\nof the coolest, and most deliberate malice, without horror.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BENJAMIN FRANKLIN BEFORE THE PRIVY COUNCIL.\r\n\r\nHe stood there, conspicuous and erect, and without moving a muscle, was\r\ncompelled to hear himself denounced as a thief, or the accomplice of\r\nthieves.]\r\n\r\nThe scene was a very strange one, and it is well suited to the brush or\r\nan historical painter. Franklin was now an old man, sixty-seven, the\r\ngreatest writer, the greatest philosopher America had produced, a member\r\nof some of the chief scientific societies in Europe, the accredited\r\nrepresentative of the most important of the colonies of America, and for\r\nnearly an hour, and in the midst of the most distinguished of living\r\nEnglishmen, he was compelled to hear himself denounced as a thief or the\r\naccomplice of thieves. He stood there conspicuous, and erect, and\r\nwithout moving a muscle, amid the torrent of invective, but his apparent\r\ncomposure was shared by few who were about him. Fox, in a speech which\r\nhe made as late as 1803, reminded the House how on that memorable\r\noccasion, \"all men tossed up their hats, and clapped their hands, in\r\nboundless delight, at Mr. Wedderburn's speech.\" The committee at once\r\nvoted that the petition of the Massachusetts Assembly was \"false,\r\ngroundless, and scandalous and calculated only for the seditious purpose\r\nof keeping up a spirit of clamor and discontent in the province.\" The\r\nking and Council confirmed the report and Franklin was ignominiously\r\ndismissed from his office of Postmaster.[133] From this time Franklin\r\nand his friends had a deep personal grudge against the British\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nAs the autumn deepened Hutchinson interpreted as favorable to himself\r\nthe symptoms he perceived of the mood of the people. Oct. 16, 1773, he\r\nwrites, \"I now see so great a change in the people wherever I travel\r\nabout the country, that I have reason to think I shall rather gain than\r\nlose by the late detestable proceedings, and my friends express stronger\r\nattachments to me than ever.\" This was only a brief Indian summer of\r\nfavor before the outbreak, not now distant, of a storm more cold and\r\npitiless than ever, for a crisis was now at hand more threatening than\r\nany that had preceded it. As shown in a previous chapter,[133] after the\r\nrepeal of the Stamp Act in order to pacify the colonists, a duty was\r\nplaced on tea, and other imports, which the colonists had always\r\nadmitted to be a valid Act of the Parliament. No revenue probably had\r\never been expected from it. It was felt that the principle that\r\nParliament might tax must be maintained; the cost of collection was\r\ngreater than the proceeds. Instead of paying 12d per pound export duty\r\nfrom England, only 3d per pound was to be charged, when imported by the\r\nEast India Company to the Colonies, thereby making a saving to the\r\ncolonists of 9d per pound which would make tea cheaper than that\r\nsmuggled in from the Dutch colonies.[134]\r\n\r\n  [133] Lecky's Am. Rev. pp. 150, 151, 152.\r\n\r\n  [134] See p. 47, for further information concerning the Stamp Act and\r\n  the Tea Tax.\r\n\r\nThe project of sending the tea, was decided on in May, 1773, and\r\nMassachusetts was the Colony where the crisis was to come. The\r\nconsignees were important persons. Two of them were Thomas and Elisha\r\nHutchinson, sons of the Governor, a third was the Governor's nephew\r\nRichard Clarke, father-in-law of Copley, the painter, a fourth was\r\nBenjamin Faneuil, a nephew of Peter Faneuil, deceased, a fifth Joshua\r\nWinslow, also of a memorable family. These held bravely to the task that\r\nhad been set for them, putting their property and lives in jeopardy\r\nuntil finally they were driven to seek refuge in the Castle. Of those\r\nopposed to them Samuel Adams was the chief, followed by Hancock,\r\nBowdoin, Dr. Thomas Young, Dr. Joseph Warren, Dr. Benjamin Church,\r\nJosiah Quincy, John Scollay, and others who lent their hands to action\r\nand their heads to counsel. Historic truth also compels the statement\r\nthat the man put forward to do the disreputable work for them was\r\n\"Captain Mackintosh\" leader of the South End toughs in street fights\r\nwith the North Enders, leader of the rioters in the destruction of the\r\nGovernor's home in August, 1765. For his part in that affair he had\r\nnever been punished, and now seems to have been rather a popular pet. He\r\nwas styled the \"First Captain-General of Liberty-Tree,\" and managed the\r\nillumination, hanging of effigies, etc. Long afterwards, in speaking of\r\nthe Tea Party he said, \"It was my chickens that did the job.\"[135]\r\n\r\n  [135] Francis Drake. \"Tea Leaves.\" Introd. p. CXXVII.\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made to cause the consignees to resign their commissions\r\nunder \"Liberty Tree;\" this they refused to do and in consequence they\r\nwere mobbed in their houses, windows and doors were smashed and amid a\r\ntempest of missiles their lives and persons were in great danger.\r\nHutchinson set himself against the \"Sons of Liberty,\" \"his course not\r\nshowing one sign vacillation from first to last, but throughout bearing\r\nthe marks of clear, cold, passionless inflexibility.\"[136]\r\n\r\n  [136] Richard Frothingham.\r\n\r\nAnother American writer says, \"To candid men, the letters he wrote in\r\nthose days of struggle ought to have interest, as well as the\r\ndeclarations of those who have portrayed him as the disgraced minion of\r\na tyrant.\"[137] Another writer, referring to his action at this time,\r\nsays, \"We can at this day well afford to mete out this tardy justice to\r\na man, whose motives and conduct have been so bitterly and\r\nunscrupulously vilified and maligned as have been those of Thomas\r\nHutchinson.\"[138]\r\n\r\n  [137] Hosmer's Life of Hutchinson, p. 299.\r\n\r\n  [138] Francis S. Drake. Tea Leaves. Int. LXIII.\r\n\r\nAt last, in December, 1773, three ships laden with tea arrived at\r\nBoston, and what followed has been told a thousand times, with all\r\npossible elaborations by those who fully sympathize with the tea mob.\r\nThe cold facts are that \"Captain Mackintosh\" and \"his chickens,\"\r\ndisguised as Mohawk Indians, instigated by Samuel Adams, John\r\nHancock[139] and other leading \"patriots\" flung the whole cargo\r\nconsisting of 342 chests, into the harbor. In the course of the violent\r\nproceedings this year the Council, the militia, and the company of\r\ncadets, had been vainly asked to assist in maintaining the law and\r\norder. The sheriff was grossly insulted, the magistrates could do\r\nnothing, and as usual, the crowning outrage of the destruction of the\r\ntea was accomplished with perfect impunity, and not a single person\r\nengaged in it was in any way molested, but every soul in Boston knew the\r\npenalty must fall, as certain as night follows day. \"The news of these\r\nevents convinced most intelligent Englishmen, that war was imminent, and\r\nthat taxation of America could only be enforced by the sword. Popular\r\nopinion in England, which had supported the repeal of the Stamp Act,\r\nwas now opposed to further concession, England, it was said, had\r\nsufficiently humiliated herself. The claim and the language of the\r\ncolonial agitators excited profound and not unnatural indignation, and\r\nevery mail from America brought news that New England at least was in a\r\ncondition of virtual rebellion, that Acts of the British Parliament were\r\ndefied and disobeyed with the most perfect impunity, that the\r\nrepresentatives of the British Government were habitually exposed to the\r\ngrossest insults, and reduced to the most humiliating impotence.\"\r\n\r\n  [139] Hancock's uncle made his large fortune by smuggling tea. See\r\n  Hutchinson His., Vol. III., p. 297.\r\n\r\nThe time for temporising, it was said, was over. It was necessary to\r\nshow that England possessed some real power of executing her laws and\r\nthe ministers were probably supported by a large majority of the English\r\npeople, when they resolved to throw away the scabbard, and to exert all\r\nthe power of Parliament to reduce Massachusetts to obedience.[140] The\r\nmeasures that were taken were very stringent. By one Act, the harbor of\r\nBoston was legally closed. \"The Custom House officers were removed to\r\nSalem. All landing, lading, and shipping of merchandise in Boston harbor\r\nwas forbidden, and English men-of-war were appointed to maintain the\r\nblockade. The town which owed its whole prosperity to its commercial\r\nactivity was debarred from all commerce by sea and was to continue under\r\nthis ban, till it had made compensation to the East India Company for\r\nthe tea which had been destroyed, and had satisfied the crown that trade\r\nwould for the future be safely carried on in Boston, property protected,\r\nlaws obeyed, and duties regularly paid.\"[141] By another Act, Parliament\r\nwas to remodel the charter of Massachusetts, the Council or Upper\r\nChamber was now to be appointed as in most of the other colonies of\r\nAmerica by the crown. The judges and magistrates of all kinds, including\r\nthe sheriffs, were to be appointed by the royal governor. Jurymen were\r\nto be summoned by the Sheriffs. That these Acts of the British\r\nParliament at this time was necessary is beyond question, for there was\r\na mob in revolutionary Boston at this time, scarcely less foul-mouthed,\r\npitiless, unscrupulous, than that which roared for the blood of the\r\nBourbons in revolutionary Paris, or that of the Commons of later times.\r\nMackintosh and his crew were unmistakably in evidence, certainly not\r\nrestrained, but connived at by the better men, so that those just as\r\nconscientious and patriotic, who tried by lawful ways to oppose, found\r\ndestruction for their property imminent, and could feel that their lives\r\nwere secure only when they had fled down the harbor to the Castle.\r\n\r\n  [140] Lecky's Am. Rev., pp. 154, 164, 165, 166.\r\n\r\n  [141] 14 George III., c. 19, 45.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams was one of the very few \"patriots\" who really disowned and\r\nopposed mob violence; not only did he defend the soldiers for killing\r\nsome of the mob, but in a letter to his wife, he said: \"mobs I do and\r\nwill detest.\"[142]\r\n\r\n  [142] Letters of John Adams, Vol. 1., p. 13.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (View from Governor Hutchinson's Field.)]\r\n\r\nOn May 10th, 1774, news reached Boston of the passing of the Boston Port\r\nBill, and the penalties the Tea-Party had brought upon the town. General\r\nGage, who was to command four regiments and a powerful fleet arrived\r\nthree days later. A military governor was now to succeed the civilian,\r\nit being understood that Hutchinson, after the disturbances were\r\nquelled, should return to power; in the meantime he was to go to\r\nEngland, and help the King with personal counsel.[143] Hutchinson's work\r\nin America was done. It may be asked, why did he remain in office in all\r\nthese years, up to this time, enforcing laws with which he had no\r\nsympathy, the instrument of a policy he disliked, wrecking in the minds\r\nof many of his countrymen the honorable name which for forty years he\r\nhad been establishing. It was certainly not for emolument. It was not\r\nfor fame, for instead of credit he had long received only abuse. He kept\r\nhoping against hope, that the home government would become wiser, that\r\nthe supremacy of Parliament, having once been recognized, should be\r\nallowed to sink out of sight, the Colonies being allowed to control\r\nthemselves as British Colonies do at the present time. He hoped that in\r\nhis own land the question of taxation would be less hotly contested by\r\nthe people. These things gained, the glorious empire of England might\r\nremain undivided, mother and daughter remaining in peace together, an\r\naffectionate headship dwelling in one, a filial and loving concession of\r\nprecedence in the other. To attain such a consummation seemed to the\r\nGovernor a thing worth suffering and striving for. To bring this about,\r\nas is shown by all his acts, and all his words, he contended year after\r\nyear, sacrificing to his aim his reputation, his fortune, at last,\r\nhardest of all, his citizenship, dying in exile of a broken heart.\r\n\r\n  [143] Hutchinson Hist. Vol. III., p. 458.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Boston he received a most complimentary address signed by\r\nthe principal inhabitants of that and other towns endorsing this course\r\nand conduct; they were known as \"Addressers,\" and were afterwards\r\npersecuted and subjected to many indignities from their fellow townsmen.\r\n\r\nJune the 1st, 1774, he turned away from his beautiful mansion and\r\nextensive farm, and walked down Milton Hill, to the Lower Mills, nodding\r\nand smiling to his neighbors on this side and that, it is said, whether\r\nWhig or Tory, he was good friends with all. He was in a cheerful mood on\r\nthat day when he left his home forever, for had not the best people of\r\nthe Province approved of him, and had shown him strong marks of favor in\r\ntheir addresses. It is very evident, as shown in all his writing, that\r\nhe was greatly attached to his beautiful country home and to his Milton\r\nneighbors, with whom he was a favorite. He mingled with them in social\r\nlife, and worshipped with them in the same church. His residence on\r\nMilton Hill is situated in one of the pleasantest places in the vicinity\r\nof Boston. It is the same to-day as it was when the Governor resided\r\nthere, with the exception that the house has been remodeled, and the\r\nsurrounding estates, now the homes of millionaires, have been greatly\r\nimproved by art. It is situated on the crest of Milton Hill--a\r\ndrumlin--to the south of which, across a beautiful valley are the Blue\r\nHills, called by the Indians the \"Massachusetts\" or the place of the\r\ngreat hills, and from which the state has derived its name. They appear\r\nlike mountains rising through the atmosphere charged with fragrant mist\r\nfrom the intervening blossoming fields, which give them a blue\r\nappearance, and soften all their ruggedness into beauty.\r\n\r\nThe mansion faces the north on the road leading to Plymouth; across the\r\nroad in front of the home is an extensive field sloping towards the\r\ngreen waving marshes that line the banks of the beautiful Neponset\r\nriver, winding its course to the harbor, which bears upon its bosom many\r\npicturesque islands and in the remote distance is seen the rocky\r\nBrewsters, on which is situated the white lighthouse, marking the edge\r\nof the ocean.[144]\r\n\r\n  [144] Several wealthy citizens of Milton have recently purchased this\r\n  field donated it to the State as a public reservation to be known as the\r\n  \"Governor Hutchinson Field.\"\r\n\r\nOn that beautiful spring morning as the Governor walked down the hill he\r\nhad no thought of a lasting absence, though martial law for a time was\r\nto be tried he was still Governor; meantime his salary was continued and\r\nhe was about to give an account of his stewardship to his royal master.\r\nAt the foot of the hill he crossed the river and there met his\r\ncarriage, next year to be confiscated, and appropriated to the use of\r\nWashington. In it he rode to what is now South Boston Point; then\r\nembarking in a boat, he was rowed to the Castle, on Castle Island, the\r\nlast bit of Massachusetts earth to feel his footfall. From here he\r\nembarked on the warship Minerva, which was to convey him to England,\r\nwhere he arrived July 1st, and was immediately received by the King, who\r\nduring the interview said, \"I believe you generally live in the country,\r\nMr. Hutchinson, what distance are you from town?\" Mr. Hutchinson\r\nreplied, \"I have lived in the country. Sir, in the summer for 20 years,\r\nbut except the winter after my house was pulled down, I have never lived\r\nin the country in the winter until the last. My house is 7 or 8 miles\r\nfrom Town, a pleasant situation, and most gentlemen from abroad say it\r\nhas the finest prospect from it they ever saw, except where great\r\nimprovements have been made by art to help the natural view.\"[145]\r\n\r\n  [145] Hutchinson Diary, Vol. II., pp. 164, 165.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (Governor Hutchinson's House on Milton Hill.)]\r\n\r\nHe often afterwards was at Court, and was treated with the greatest\r\nkindness by both King and Queen. A baronetcy was offered him, which he\r\ndeclined because of insufficient means to support the title, his\r\nproperty in America having been confiscated. He was however handsomely\r\npensioned. He does indeed write under date of September 1st, 1778, \"The\r\nchanges in the last four or five years of my life make the whole scene,\r\nwhen I look back upon it appear like a dream or other delusions. From\r\nthe possession of one of the best houses in Boston, the pleasantest\r\nhouse and farm at Milton, of almost any in the world and one of the best\r\nestates in the Colony of Rhode Island, with an affluent income, and a\r\nprospect of being able to make a handsome provision for each of my\r\nchildren at my death--I have not a foot of land at my command, and\r\npersonal estate of L7000 only, depending on the bounty of Government for\r\na pension, which, though it affords a present ample provision for\r\nmyself, and enables me to distribute L500 a year among my children, yet\r\nis precarious, and I cannot avoid anxiety. But I am still distinguished\r\nby a kind Providence from my suffering relations, friends, and\r\ncountrymen in America as well as from many of them in England, and have\r\ngreat reason to be thankful that so much money is yet continued to\r\nme.\"[146]\r\n\r\n  [146] Diary and Letters of H. Vol. II., p. 216.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (Inland View from Governor Hutchinson's House.)]\r\n\r\nThe Governor's diary in England is a profoundly pathetic record of a man\r\nbroken-hearted by his expatriation. His sons and daughters and their\r\nfamilies to the number of twenty-five were all dependent upon him. \"He\r\nis glad he has a home for them, when so many fellow-exiles are in\r\nwant.\" As Hutchinson was by far the ablest and most eminent of his\r\nparty, so his sufferings were especially sharp. His name was held to be\r\na stigma. Hutchinson Street in Boston became Pearl Street. The town of\r\nHutchinson in the heart of the Commonwealth, cast off its title as that\r\n\"of one who had acted the part of a traitor and parricide,\" substituting\r\nfor it that of Barre, the liberal champion in Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe honorable name he had made through forty years of self-denying\r\nwisely directed public service, was blotted out, for generations it was\r\na mark for obloquy. His great possession and large estate were\r\nconfiscated, and to the shame of his countrymen be it said, they did not\r\nspare even his family tomb. It was sold by the State and the bones of\r\nhis ancestors, some of the greatest men of the colony, and those of his\r\nwife and children were thrown out. The old stone with the Hutchinson\r\ncrest on it still remains over the tomb in Copp's Hill burial ground\r\nwith the name of the new owner of the tomb rudely marked on it. Could\r\nthe governor have had a premonition of what was going to happen when he\r\nwrote to his son, Feb. 22, 1775, that he wished to have a new tomb built\r\nat Milton, and the remains of his wife, deceased twenty-one years, to be\r\ntenderly removed from Copp's Hill and deposited therein, with space for\r\nhimself, and bade him \"leave the wall or any ornament or inscription\r\ntill I return, and the sooner it is finished the better.\"\r\n\r\nHis son Thomas had left Milton and retired to Boston before he received\r\nhis father's letter. Hostilities immediately followed, and were\r\nsucceeded by the confiscation of the estates of the loyalists. Hence\r\nthis cherished design of the governor was never carried out. Again on\r\nMay 15th, 1779, he writes in his diary, \"And though I know not how to\r\nreason upon it, I feel a fondness to lay my bones in my native soil and\r\nto carry those of my dear daughter with me.\" Again he writes, \"The\r\nprospect of returning to America and laying my bones in the land of my\r\nforefathers for four preceding generations, and if I add the mother of\r\nW. H. it will make five, is less than it has ever been.\" Then at last\r\nthis entry is found. \"Sept. 16, 1779. Stopped at Croydon, went into the\r\nchurch, looked upon the grave of my dear child, inquired whether there\r\nwas room for me, and was informed there was.\" He was indeed sinking\r\nfast, and his end was rapidly approaching. A few months later, June 3,\r\n1780, as he was walking down the steps of his house to his coach, going\r\nfor his morning drive, he fell into the arms of his servant, and with\r\none or two gasps he resigned his soul to God, who gave it. He was buried\r\nat Croydon on the 9th of June. It would scarcely be possible for a human\r\nlife to close among circumstances of deeper gloom. Utter destruction had\r\novertaken his family. His daughters and his son dispirited, dropped\r\nprematurely at the same time with him into the grave. His son \"Billy\"\r\ndied on Feb. 20. A child of Elisha's died on June 25th, and his daughter\r\nSarah died on the 28th. In daily contact with him was a company of\r\nLoyalist exiles, once men of position and wealth, now discredited,\r\ndisheartened, and in danger of starvation. The country he loved and had\r\nsuffered so much for, had nothing for him but contumely. To a man like\r\nHutchinson public calamity would cause a deeper pang than private\r\nsorrow. No more threatening hour for England has probably ever struck\r\nthan that in which the soul of this great and good man passed away. It\r\nhad become apparent that America was lost, a separation that might be\r\nfatal to the empire, and which her hereditary enemies were hastening to\r\nmake the most of. To America herself the rending seemed to many certain\r\nto be fatal.\r\n\r\nWhile the members were thus being torn away, destruction seemed to\r\nimpend at the heart. At the moment of his death, London was at the mercy\r\nof the mob, in the Gordon riots. The city was on fire in many places, a\r\ndrunken multitude murdered, right and left, laying hands even upon the\r\nnoblest of the land. Lord Mansfield, Chief Justice of England, because\r\nhe had recommended to the mercy of a jury, a priest arrested for\r\ncelebrating mass, saved his life with difficulty, his home with all his\r\npossessions going up in flames. What a remarkable coincidence this was\r\nwith what happened to the governor when he was Chief Justice of\r\nMassachusetts. The exile's funeral passed on its way through smoke, and\r\nuproar, that might easily have been regarded as the final crash of the\r\nsocial structure. No one foresaw then what was immediately to come; that\r\nEngland was to make good her loss twice over, that America was to become\r\nthe most powerful of nations, that the London disorders were on the\r\nsurface merely, and only transient. In Hutchinson's latest\r\nconsciousness, every person, every spot, every institution dear to his\r\nheart must have seemed to be overwhelmed in catastrophe. Such was the\r\nend of a life thoroughly dutiful and honorable.[147]\r\n\r\n  [147] Hosmer's Life of Hutchinson, p. 349.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Cromwell, his body was buried in Henry VII chapel, and\r\nafter the restoration it was disinterred and gibbeted at Tyburn, and\r\nthen buried under the gallows, the head being placed on a pike over\r\nWestminster Hall, where Cromwell had Charles I condemned to death. And\r\nnow nearly two and one-half centuries since this event occurred a\r\nbeautiful monument of Cromwell has been erected by Parliament on the\r\nlawn a few feet from Westminster Hall where the above events took place.\r\nWill the city of Boston ever do likewise and erect a statue to Governor\r\nHutchinson in some public place as a slight atonement for the obloquy\r\ncast upon his name, the desecration of his family tomb, and as a\r\nrecognition of the great services he rendered his native state, for\r\ncertainly he was one of the worthiest sons that Massachusetts has ever\r\nproduced, and there should be some memorial in the place of his birth,\r\nto record his private virtues, his historical labors, his high station,\r\nhis commanding influences, and his sorrows, which have an interest,\r\nwhich none acquainted with his life can fail to feel.\r\n\r\nThe following list of estates belonging to Thomas Hutchinson situated\r\nat, and near Boston, taken from him under the Conspiracy and\r\nConfiscation Acts comprises nineteen parcels of land. The state\r\nreceived for them L98,121, 4s or about $490,000. His mansion house on\r\nthe corner of Fleet and Hanover Streets brought L33,500. The Governor\r\nowned other valuable real estate in Rhode Island and other parts of\r\nMassachusetts, particularly in that part now the State of Maine. He was\r\nprobably the wealthiest person in the state of Massachusetts at the\r\ncommencement of the Revolutionary War. The author is indebted to the\r\nlate John T. Hassam, A.

He was born in Boston in 1740. He\r\nmarried Oct. 10, 1771, Sarah, daughter of Lieut. Governor Andrew Oliver.\r\nHe was Judge of the Probate Court for the County of Suffolk. He was\r\nMandamus Councillor, and an Andresser of General Gage. He and his family\r\nwere in Boston during the blockade, and bombardment. At the evacuation,\r\nthey went aboard ship with their two children, when the third child was\r\nborn, as they were leaving for England. Dr. Peter Oliver, the second son\r\nof Chief Justice Oliver, refers to this matter in his Diary, as follows:\r\n\"We remained blocked up in Boston till the beginning of March, 1776,\r\nwhen we were ordered to embark. Tommy Hutchinson's family and mine went\r\naboard the Hyde Pacquet for England, March 25th, 1776, we set sail for\r\nEngland. The day before we set sail from Nantasket, Tommy's wife was\r\ndelivered of a boy which had not a drop of milk during the whole\r\npassage, was much emaciated, and no one thought it would have lived. The\r\nlady well. As to myself, I was sick 21 days without any support; reduced\r\nalmost to a skeleton. Seven children on board ship, and the eldest not 6\r\nyears old.\"\r\n\r\nThe child born aboard ship was baptised Andrew, after its mother's\r\nfather, Lieut. Gov. Andrew Oliver. It grew up, married, left children,\r\nwas an eminent surgeon, and after a long life, died Dec. 23, 1846, aged\r\n70 years. He was the father of the late Peter Orlando Hutchinson, great\r\ngrandson of the Governor who edited the two volumes of the Diary of\r\nGovernor Hutchinson, published in 1883. He was a local antiquary, of\r\nlocal repute, and a gentleman of great kindness of heart. He was a\r\nbachelor, and died at Sidmouth, Devon, Oct. 1st, 1897, aged 87, and was\r\nthe last of his generation.\r\n\r\nHis last words at the end of the second volume, are as follows: \"If in\r\nthese volumes, I have anywhere said anything of my American friends that\r\nis untrue, or too harsh for the occasion, I regret it should have been\r\nso, and I willingly withdraw it altogether. I need not apologise for any\r\nunkind remarks that may have been made by the Governor, though most\r\nconcerned, for he made none; and when they have made reparation for all\r\nthe slander and misrepresentation which they have persistently heaped\r\nupon him during the last 120 years, then--we shall be quits. It is time\r\nto bury the hatchet. Farewell.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Hutchinson, the subject of this sketch, writing to his brother\r\nunder date of Nov. 15th, 1788, alluded to the trying position in which\r\nthe Loyalists were placed, he says, \"We will give a little attention to\r\na large and suffering body of people whose only crime had been that of\r\nfidelity to the Mother country. Driven out of the land of their\r\nadoption, they fled back to the land of their ancestors, where most of\r\nthem were strangers. Some pressed their claims for relief from the\r\nEnglish Government; others applied to the American Courts for recovery\r\nof the estates themselves, while others despairing of success, gave up\r\neverything for lost, and sat down resigned to their fate. Sir Francis\r\nBernard lost the valuable Island of Mount Desert, and Sir William\r\nPepperell lost miles of coast line, stretching away from Kittery Point\r\nto Saco, extending miles into the interior.\"\r\n\r\n\"These unfortunate people were very difficultly placed--if they had\r\njoined the American party, they would have been Rebels to England, but\r\nwhen the war was over and they applied for the restitution of their\r\nestates they were told they were Rebels to America.\"\r\n\r\nWriting again under date of 1789, he said: \"We proceeded to Exeter, and\r\nI have taken a house at a mile from the town, but in the neighborhood,\r\nthe house furnished, and has every convenience about it, with about six\r\nacres of land--mowing, orchard, and garden stocked with fruit trees. I\r\ncould have had my house and garden without the land, at L45, and am to\r\npay L60 per ann. for the whole. The last year my orchard produced 20\r\nhhds of cyder.\"\r\n\r\nThus the family became settled in a respectable looking old house built\r\nin the Queen Anne style, known as East Wonford near Heavitree church,\r\nwhere it still stands. The rent appears to be extraordinarily low. He\r\nwould not bind himself to a lease, for he still had hopes of returning\r\nto America, but the return was never to be. The Hutchinsons had very\r\nlittle chance of a favorable hearing in Massachusetts, and their large\r\nfortune there was forever lost to them. The family seems to have been\r\ncontent with their new home, for in another letter to his brother of May\r\n19, 1791, Thomas says:--\"After eighteen months residence, we continue to\r\nthink this a very agreeable part of England; and perhaps I could not\r\nhave made a better pitch than I have done.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Hutchinson, son of the Governor, died in 1811, and his wife in\r\n1802. They were deposited in a vault in the middle of Heavitree church.\r\nThe church was pulled down in 1843 and a new one erected on the same\r\nsite.\r\n\r\nThomas, his eldest son, grandson of the Governor, was born in America in\r\n1772, brought to England by his father in 1776, he was a\r\nBarrister-at-Law, resided during the early years of his career at No. 14\r\nNew Boswell Court, Lincoln's Inn, London, and after that in Magdalen\r\nStreet, Exeter. He married twice, had three sons and one daughter. He is\r\nburied in the N. W. corner of Heavitree churchyard. A stone with the\r\nfollowing inscription marks the spot: \"Underneath this stone Lie the\r\nmortal remains of Thomas Hutchinson, Barrister-at-Law, who departed this\r\nlife the 12th of November 1837, aged 65.\"\r\n\r\nMary Oliver Hutchinson, daughter of Thomas Hutchinson, and granddaughter\r\nof the Governor, was born in America, Oct. 14, 1773, and was brought to\r\nEngland by her father in 1776, married Captain W. S. Oliver, R. N.,\r\ngrandson of Lieut. Governor Andrew Oliver, at Heavitree, in Oct. 1811.\r\nShe died at East Tergnmouth, Devon, July 11th, 1833, leaving one son and\r\ntwo daughters of whom more presently.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hutchinson, son of Thomas and grandson of the Governor, was born\r\nin England, June 14, 1778. He entered the church and was pastor for some\r\ntime at Heavitree and Colebrook, Devon. He had two sons and three\r\ndaughters. Rev. William Hutchinson, died May 3rd, 1816.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ELISHA HUTCHINSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nSon of Governor Hutchinson, was born Dec. 24, 1745, at Boston. He\r\ngraduated at Harvard College in 1762. His wife Mary was the eldest\r\ndaughter of Colonel George Watson of Plymouth, Mass. He was the\r\ncommercial partner of his brother Thomas. They were the consignees of\r\none-third of the tea. Their names were given to the East India Company\r\nby a London correspondent, who solicits the consignment for them,\r\nwithout mentioning their connection with the Governor, although the\r\nhistorian Bancroft falsely asserts that he had a pecuniary interest in\r\nthe shipment, of which there is not the slightest evidence.[148] He\r\naccompanied his father to England in 1774, leaving his wife in America,\r\nwith the intention of rejoining her in a few months, but it was three\r\nyears before she could join him in England. Having reached his 80th year\r\nhe died at Tutbury, June 24, 1824, having had issue three daughters and\r\ntwo sons. His son John, born Sept. 21, 1793, was perpetual curate of\r\nBlurton near Trentham, Co. Staff. Percentor and Canon of Lichfield,\r\nEditor of Vol. 3 of Gov. Hutchinson Hist. of Mass., in 1828. He married\r\nhis cousin Martha Oliver Hutchinson, May 10th, 1836. He died April 27,\r\n1865, at Blurton, having had issue two daughters and one son, John\r\nRogers, born March 6, 1848, who married Ruth Hombersley, Oct. 19, 1882,\r\nat Kirk Ireton, Derbyshire.\r\n\r\n  [148] Tea Leaves, p. 324.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FOSTER HUTCHINSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWas brother of Governor Hutchinson, and one of the last judges of the\r\nsupreme court of Massachusetts. He graduated at Harvard University in\r\n1743. He accepted the appointment of mandamus councillor in 1774 and\r\nsoon after was compelled to take refuge in Boston. He was proscribed and\r\nbanished and his estates were confiscated. He left Boston at the\r\nevacuation in 1776, and with his family of twelve persons went to\r\nHalifax. He died in Nova Scotia in 1799. His son, Foster, an Assistant\r\nJudge of the Supreme Court of that Colony died in 1815, and his daughter\r\nAbigail deceased at Halifax, July 1843, aged seventy-four years. Foster\r\nand his brother Thomas had a dry goods store in 1765 below the \"Swing\r\nBridge\" near what is now the corner of Hanover and Salem streets.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFISCATED ESTATES BELONGING TO FOSTER HUTCHINSON ET AL IN SUFFOLK\r\n                         COUNTY AND TO WHOM SOLD.\r\n\r\n     To Ebenezer Parsons, Daniel Sargent, Feb. 25, 1783; Lib. 137, fol.\r\n       95; Land and dwelling-house in Boston, Fish St. W.; passageways N.\r\n       and E.; land purchased by Thomas Stephenson S.----Land and\r\n       dwelling-house, Fish St. W.; land purchased by John Hancock N.;\r\n       Thomas Hutchinson E.; land purchased by John Hotty S.----Land,\r\n       store, block-maker's shop and other work places near the above,\r\n       passageways S.; W. and E.; Thomas Hutchinson N.----Flats, dock,\r\n       wharf and stores, near the above, passage W.; dock N.; sea E.; dock\r\n       S.----Flats, dock and wharf adjoining the above described wharf,\r\n       John Brick S.; passageways W. and N.; dock N.; the sea E.\r\n\r\n     To John Codman, Jr., Sept. 25, 1783; Lib 140, fol. 4; Land, wharf\r\n       and dock in Boston.

There is nothing to show that Richard ever came to\r\nthis country, and when William and his wife Anne was expelled from\r\nBoston, the lot which had been granted to him in 1634, now known as the\r\n\"Old Corner Bookstore,\" which then extended to the City Hall lot, was\r\nsold by his son Edward to Richard Hutchinson of London, linen-draper.\r\nThis was the father of Eliakim. The subject of this notice was the great\r\ngrandson of the emigrant. He was born in 1711 and married Elizabeth,\r\neldest daughter of Governor Shirley. He was a member of the Governor's\r\nCouncil and Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas for Suffolk\r\nCounty. In 1764 he purchased from his father-in-law \"Shirley Hall,\" the\r\nfinest estate in Roxbury. In 1746 Governor Shirley bought thirty-three\r\nacres of land and erected this palatial mansion on it. Its oaken frame\r\nand other materials, even the bricks, it is said, were brought from\r\nEngland, at a vast expense. It has been removed from its original\r\nlocation, and is now occupied as a tenement house, yet, notwithstanding\r\nthe vicissitudes it has undergone, it is extremely well preserved. One\r\nof the peculiarities of \"Shirley Place,\" as the governor styled it, is\r\nits double front. From the upper windows a fine view is obtained of the\r\ncity, harbor and islands. Each front was approached by a flight of stone\r\nsteps flanked by an iron railing of an antique and rustic pattern.\r\nEntering the northern or proper front, you find yourself in a spacious\r\nhall of grand proportions. To the right a broad staircase leads to a\r\nbalcony extending around to the left where two doors open into the guest\r\nchambers in which Washington, Lafayette, Franklin, Daniel Webster and\r\nmany other celebrated men have from time to time been accommodated. From\r\nthe balcony the musicians entertained the company at the table in the\r\nhall. The carved balusters around the staircase and gallery are of three\r\ndifferent patterns, and the rail surmounting them is inlaid at the top.\r\nThe base of the balustrade and staircase, is also adorned with a carved\r\nrunning vine. To the right and left of the hall are doors leading into\r\nthe reception room, parlors, etc. Upon great occasions the two halls\r\nwere thrown into one by opening the folding doors between. Washington\r\npaid a visit to Governor Shirley in March 1756, to relate to him the\r\ncircumstances of his son's death who was killed at the battle of the\r\nMonongahela. In a letter to his friend and patron Lord Fairfax, he says,\r\n\"I have had the honor of being introduced to several governors,\r\nespecially Mr. Shirley, whose character and appearance, have perfectly\r\ncharmed me.\" The next time Washington visited \"Shirley Place\" it was not\r\nas a guest, but as an enemy.\r\n\r\nGovernor Shirley was a man of great industry and ability, thoroughly\r\nable, enterprising, and deservedly popular. He was a strong advocate of\r\nprerogative and in 1756 advised the ministry to impose a stamp tax in\r\nAmerica. In February, 1755, he was made a major-general, with\r\nsuperintendence of military operations in the Northern Colonies. It was\r\nthen, after the disastrous defeat and death of General Braddock, that\r\nMajor Washington came to report it to him, and he was superseded both in\r\nhis command and his government, and ordered to England. Triumphantly\r\nvindicating himself from the charges against him, he was made a\r\nlieutenant-general in 1759, and was governor of the Bahamas from 1758 to\r\nJune 1769 when he returned to Roxbury, residing with his son-in-law in\r\nthe mansion built by him until his death, March 24, 1771, and was\r\ninterred in the burying ground of King's Chapel, which edifice he caused\r\nto be built while governor.\r\n\r\nJudge Eliakim Hutchinson died in June, 1775. He had a high standing at\r\nthe bar, being well versed in his profession, and enjoyed a good\r\nreputation as a general scholar, and as a man of high moral and\r\nreligious principles. He was early imbued with principles favorable to\r\nthe government, but was never a bitter, nor even a warm partisan.\r\n\r\nHis patrimonial inheritance, aided by industry enabled him to acquire a\r\nhandsome fortune, one of the largest in the province. He adhered to\r\ngovernment from the beginning of the controversy, but the moderation of\r\nhis conduct, his superior fitness for his office, and the confidence in\r\nhis integrity, secured him public favor through the stormy period, which\r\ncommenced soon after his appointment to the Governor's Council. But this\r\nwas an unpardonable offence in the eyes of the \"Sons of Despotism.\" It\r\nwas however unsolicited, unexpected and accepted with great reluctance,\r\nand although he died before actual hostilities had scarcely commenced,\r\nyet his large and valuable estate was confiscated. That portion of it in\r\nSuffolk County was inventoried at L21,400, Shirley Place with eighty\r\nacres of land was valued at L12,000. During the siege of Boston the\r\nmansion was used as a barracks by the Revolutionary troops and was\r\ngreatly injured thereby.\r\n\r\nIt was purchased from the State by John Read, and then passed through\r\nmany hands, and in 1819 was purchased by Governor Eustis, who passed\r\nthe remainder of his days there, dying in 1825. Among the guests that\r\naccepted his hospitality was John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, Daniel\r\nWebster, Aaron Burr, and John Calhoun.\r\n\r\nJudge Hutchinson's wife left Boston at the evacuation, and went to\r\nEngland. She died at London in 1790.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HUTCHINSON, son of Eliakim Hutchinson, graduated at Harvard\r\nCollege in 1762. He went to the Bahamas when his grandfather Shirley\r\nbecame Governor of same. In 1771 William Hutchinson was appointed Judge\r\nof the Admiralty Court of the Bahama Islands. He died in England in\r\n1790.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF CONFISCATED ESTATES BELONGING TO ELIAKIM HUTCHINSON IN SUFFOLK\r\n                          COUNTY AND TO WHOM SOLD.\r\n\r\n     To William McNeill, Archibald McNeill.

Lieutenant Governor 1770-4. Died in Boston, March,\r\n1774.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ANDREW OLIVER.\r\n\r\n               LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS 1770-1774.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Oliver family are among the most prominent of the early colonial\r\nfamilies. Thomas Oliver came from Bristol in 1632. He was one of the\r\nfounders, and Elder of the First Church in Boston.[149] His son Peter\r\nborn in England in 1622 and died in Boston in 1670, was a prominent\r\nmerchant, and commander of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company\r\nin 1669 and was one of the founders of the Old South Church. Peter's son\r\nDaniel married Elizabeth, the daughter of Andrew Belcher, who was the\r\nfather of Governor Jonathan Belcher.\r\n\r\n  [149] He lived on Washington Street; his lot extended north from Spring\r\n  Lane, including the head of Water Street.\r\n\r\nANDREW OLIVER, son of Daniel Oliver, a member of the Council, and\r\nbrother of Peter Oliver, the Chief Justice. He graduated at Harvard\r\nCollege in 1724. He was a representative from Boston, member of the\r\ncouncil and Secretary of the Province. In 1765, soon after receiving the\r\nappointment of Stamp Collector, without his solicitation, he not\r\napproving of the Act, he became very unpopular. The rough population\r\nwhich abounded about the wharves and shipyards, whose movements were\r\ndirected by persons of higher rank and larger views of mischief, grew\r\nriotous, and with the usual want of discrimination shown by mobs, were\r\nnot slow to lift their hands against even their best friends. The houses\r\nof the Custom and Admiralty officials were attacked, which culminating\r\nin an extraordinary outrage against Andrew Oliver, which led John Adams\r\nto exclaim, \"Has not the blind undistinguishing rage of the rabble done\r\nthat gentleman irreparable injustice\"?[150] He was hung in effigy, a\r\ndrunken crowd carrying the effigy through the Town House, even while the\r\nGovernor and Council were in session. The building he had fitted for the\r\ntransaction of business was destroyed. Taking a portion of it for a\r\nfire, the mob proceeded to Fort Hill where Mr. Oliver lived and burned\r\nhis effigy in a bonfire before his home; they then went to work on the\r\nbarn, fence, garden, and dwelling house. After breaking all the windows\r\nthey entered the house and damaged and destroyed his furniture,\r\ncompletely wrecking this beautiful mansion. The business being finished,\r\nthe \"Sons of Despotism\" proceeded to the Province-house, gave three\r\nhuzzas and dispersed. On the day following the riot, Mr. Oliver resigned\r\nhis office. In writing to a friend he says, \"I was persuaded to yield in\r\norder to prevent what was coming on the second night.\" This action of\r\nthe mob caused intense suffering both to himself and family.[151]\r\n\r\n  [150] John Adams' Diary, Aug. 15, 1765.\r\n\r\n  [151] See page 40 for account of the riot.\r\n\r\nIn 1770, Mr. Oliver was appointed Lieutenant Governor. In 1773, several\r\nletters which he had written to persons in England, and which were\r\nobtained surreptitiously by Franklin and sent to Boston, created much\r\nexcitement and abuse of the writers.[152] In addition to the assaults\r\nat home, he was accused in England by Arthur Lee who signed himself\r\nJunius Americanus with the grave crime of perjury. \"Scarce any man ever\r\nhad a more scrupulous and sacred regard for truth, and yet, to such a\r\ndegree did the malignant spirit of party prevail as to cause this man in\r\nthe public papers in England, to bring against him a charge of perjury.\r\nThe Council of Massachusetts Bay, from whose votes and resolves this\r\nwriter attempted to support the charge, by vote which they caused to be\r\nprinted, repaired the injury as well as they could, but a consciousness\r\nof his innocence and integrity, however, together with the reproaches\r\nmost injuriously cast upon him by the resolves of the council and house,\r\nin which he was treated as the determined enemy of the liberties of his\r\ncountry, the interest whereof according to the best of his judgment\r\n(which was much superior to that of his most virulent persecutors) he\r\nalways had at heart, affected his spirits and evidently accelerated his\r\ndeath.\"[153] Mr. Oliver was now advanced in life, and unable to endure\r\nthe disquiet and misery caused by his position in affairs at so troubled\r\na period, soon sunk under the burden. After a short illness he died at\r\nBoston in March 1774, aged 67. By the testimony of foes as well as\r\nfriends, he was a most useful and estimable man, modest, indefatigable,\r\nwell-cultured, soundly sensible. He had been the most beloved member of\r\na family greatly beloved, and no charge could be brought against him\r\nexcept that in his political principles he sided with the Government. He\r\nwas a liberal benefactor to his ALMA MATER in books, ancient\r\nmanuscripts, and anatomical preparations. At his funeral the mob was\r\nagain in evidence. The House of Representatives withdrew from the\r\nprocession because a certain punctilio was neglected. The mob of Boston\r\nran after the funeral train hooting and in an unseemly way hilarious,\r\ngave three cheers when the mourners came out of the graveyard, his\r\nbrother the Chief Justice, intrepid as he was, did not dare to be\r\npresent, because his life was threatened. Had he died before this\r\nviolent spirit was raised, he would have been revered by all orders and\r\ndegrees of men in the Province.\r\n\r\n  [152] See page 162, 163 concerning Hutchinson and other letters\r\n  abstracted by Franklin.\r\n\r\n  [153] Curwin's Journal, pp. 462, 463.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of large wealth for those days. The inventory of his real\r\nestate was as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Mansion House and Buildings situated near Fort Hill.\r\n\r\nThe Brick School House near Griffin's Wharf.\r\n\r\nA Warehouse on Long Wharf.\r\n\r\nA right in said Wharf.\r\n\r\nThe Buildings and Land etc., on Oliver's Dock.\r\n\r\nA Brick House on Union Street with a small Wooden Shop adjoining and\r\nLand belonging thereto.\r\n\r\nA Dwelling House and about three Acres of Land at Dorchester.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANDREW OLIVER MANSION, WASHINGTON STREET, DORCHESTER.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Governor of Massachusetts, 1770-74.]\r\n\r\nThe last named building is the only one now in existence, and the\r\nfollowing description of it at the time of writing, may be interesting\r\nto the reader.\r\n\r\nLieut. Governor Oliver's country house in Dorchester is situated on the\r\ncorner of Washington and Park streets. In the old deeds it is described\r\nas being \"On the Road leading to Milton.\" The house appears the same as\r\nin the olden times. Not one whit has the estate changed outside of the\r\ninterior of the great house. The broad acres that surround it still\r\nspread out before and behind it, the same drives are lined with great\r\nEnglish Elms as in the old days; no finer old mansion house of the\r\ncolonial period is to be found in New England, none is richer in\r\nmemories of olden times. Here Lieut. Gov. Andrew Oliver entertained the\r\nfinest of the land, where gentlemen in powdered wigs and ladies in fine\r\nold silks used to dance the minuet, and where the negro slaves used to\r\nbe happy in their own way. It was sold by John J. Spooner, administrator\r\nof the estate of Andrew Oliver, to Col. Benjamin Hichborn, and was used\r\nby him as a summer residence. In 1817 it went into the hands of his\r\nbrother, Samuel Hichborn, who entertained there Gen. Lafayette, and\r\nPresidents Jefferson, and Munroe. For many years it was owned and\r\noccupied by the famous chocolate manufacturer, Walter Baker. At the\r\ndecease of Mrs. Baker, it was purchased by the Colonial Club who now\r\noccupy it as a club house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THOMAS OLIVER.\r\n\r\n        LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS, 1774-1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Oliver was born in Antigua and graduated at Harvard College in\r\n1753, he was the son of Robert Oliver, a wealthy planter from Antigua\r\nwho settled in Dorchester. His parentage is unknown, there were Olivers\r\nin Dorchester as early as 1637, and he may have descended from\r\nthem.[154] He brought with him from Antigua his wife Anne and one son,\r\nThomas, the subject of this notice. He purchased a number of pieces of\r\nland of which 30 acres had been the property of Comfort Foster, on this\r\nhomestead lot he built in 1745 a fine mansion, on what is now known as\r\nEdward Everett square. Tradition records, that he brought many slaves\r\nwith him, and when they were given wheelbarrows in which to carry the\r\ndirt, in ignorance of their proper use they carried them upon their\r\nheads, in just the same manner as the writer has seen negroes at the\r\npresent time carry burdens on their heads on the \"Pope's Head\" estate in\r\nAntigua where these slaves came from. In Dorchester Robert Oliver had\r\nborn to him sons, Isaac and Richard, and a daughter, Elizabeth, who\r\nbecame the wife of John Vassall, Jr. He died December 20, 1762. \"The\r\nPost Boy\" contained the following brief obituary: \"Thursday morning\r\nlast died at his seat in Dorchester, in the 63d year of his age, Col.\r\nRobert Oliver. A Gentleman of extensive Acquaintance, remarkable for his\r\nHospitality to All, was kind to the Poor, and in his Military Character,\r\nbeloved and esteem'd, his Family and Neighbours, have met with a great\r\nLoss in this Bereavement; His Remains are to be interr'd Tomorrow at 3\r\no'clock in the Family Tomb at Dorchester.\" About two years before this\r\nThomas, his eldest son, had married Elizabeth, daughter of Col. John\r\nVassall of Cambridge, making a double connection by marriage between\r\nthese two families. Closely allied with them by marriage were the\r\nRoyalls, all three families being probably originally of New England,\r\nthen resident in Antigua and Jamaica, and returning here to enjoy their\r\nacquired wealth. All three families built houses which have lasted to\r\nour time: Royall in Medford, Vassall in Cambridge and Oliver in\r\nDorchester.\r\n\r\n  [154] Sabine says Dorchester. Dorchester Record says Thomas Oliver, the\r\n  son of Robert Oliver, Esqr., and Ann, his wife, was born Jan. 5, 1733-4\r\n  at ye Island of Antigua.\r\n\r\nThomas Oliver remained for several years in Dorchester after his\r\nfather's death. He inherited a large estate from his grandfather, James\r\nBrown, and from his great-uncle, Robert Oliver. He then began life under\r\nthe most favorable auspices. His father-in-law was John Vassall of\r\nCambridge, who married the daughter of Lieutenant-Governor Spencer\r\nPhips. Being a man of fortune he did not mingle in the stormy political\r\ncontests of that period until a day fatal to his peace and quiet, when\r\nhe accepted the office of Lieutenant-Governor. He has been represented\r\nas a mild, peaceable person, and gentlemanly in deportment. In 1766 he\r\nremoved to Cambridge and built the fine mansion recently occupied by\r\nJames Russell Lowell. He sold his Dorchester mansion to Richard\r\nLechmere, who was the uncle by marriage of Oliver's wife, he having\r\nmarried May Phips, whose sister Elizabeth married Col. John Vassall, who\r\ndied in 1741. In 1771 the mansion passed into the hands of John Vassall,\r\na son of the Colonel, who was a Loyalist, and his property was\r\nconfiscated. It was sold by the State to John Williams; it afterwards\r\npassed into the possession of Oliver Everett in 1792, and here his son\r\nEdward Everett was born in 1794. The house was torn down in 1900 and the\r\nsquare in front of it, previously known as the Five Corners, was named\r\nEdward Everett Square. On the opposite side of the square on a part of\r\nthe same estate in a small park is situated a house built by one of the\r\nearliest settlers, about 1640, owned and occupied by the Dorchester\r\nHistorical Society.\r\n\r\nThomas Oliver was the last Royal Lieutenant-Governor and President of\r\nthe Council of Massachusetts. He received his appointment from the Crown\r\nin 1774, after the decease of Andrew Oliver, who was of a totally\r\ndistinct family; it is understood that the King thought he was\r\nappointing Chief Justice Peter Oliver, a brother of Andrew, a much more\r\nactive man in the politics of the times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS OLIVER AND JOHN VASSALL MANSION, DORCHESTER.\r\n\r\nIt stood on the north side of Edward Everett square. A bronze tablet\r\nmarks its site. Edward Everett was born here April 11, 1794. (see p.\r\n183.)]\r\n\r\nHis appointment as Councillor was by the King's writ of mandamus which\r\nwas held, was contrary to the charter. This made him an object of\r\npopular resentment. He detailed the course pursued against him, in\r\nconsequence of being sworn into office in the following narrative dated\r\nSeptember 7, 1774, which as throwing light on the transaction of the\r\ntimes is inserted entire:\r\n\r\n\"Early in the morning\" (of September 2d), said he, \"a number of\r\ninhabitants of Charlestown called at my house to acquaint me that a\r\nlarge body of people from several towns in the county were on their way\r\ncoming down to Cambridge; that they were afraid some bad consequences\r\nmight ensue, and begged I would go out to meet them, and endeavor to\r\nprevail on them to return. In a very short time, before I could prepare\r\nmyself to go, they appeared in sight. I went out to them, and asked the\r\nreasons of their appearance in that manner; they respectfully answered,\r\nthey 'came peaceably to inquire into their grievances, not with design\r\nto hurt any man.' I perceived they were landholders of the neighboring\r\ntowns, and was thoroughly persuaded they would do no harm. I was desired\r\nto speak to them; I accordingly did, in such a manner as I thought best\r\ncalculated to quiet their minds. They thanked me for my advice, said\r\nthey were no mob, but sober, orderly people, who would commit no\r\ndisorders; and then proceeded on their way. I returned to my house. Soon\r\nafter they had arrived on the Common at Cambridge, a report arose that\r\nthe troops were on their march from Boston; I was desired to go and\r\nintercede with his Excellency to prevent their coming. From principles\r\nof humanity to the country, from a general love of mankind, and from\r\npersuasions that they were orderly people, I readily undertook it; and\r\nis there a man on earth, who, placed in my circumstances, could have\r\nrefused it? I am informed I am censured for having advised the general\r\nto a measure which may reflect on the troops, as being too inactive upon\r\nsuch a general disturbance; but surely such a reflection on a military\r\nman can never arise but in the minds of such as are entirely ignorant of\r\nthese circumstances. Wherever this affair is known, it must also be\r\nknown it was my request the troops should not be sent, but to return; as\r\nI passed the people I told them, of my own accord, I would return and\r\nlet them know the event of my application (not, as was related in the\r\npapers, to confer with them on my own circumstances as President of the\r\nCouncil). On my return I went to the Committee, I told them no troops\r\nhad been ordered, and from the account I had given his Excellency, none\r\nwould be ordered. I was then thanked for the trouble I had taken in the\r\naffair, and was just about to leave them to their own business, when one\r\nof the Committee observed, that as I was present it might be proper to\r\nmention a matter they had to propose to me. It was, that although they\r\nhad a respect for me as Lieutenant-Governor of the Province, they could\r\nwish I would resign my seat. I told them I took it very unkind that they\r\nshould mention anything on that subject; and among other reasons I\r\nurged, that, as Lieutenant-Governor, I stood in a particular relation to\r\nthe Province in general, and therefore could not hear anything upon that\r\nmatter from a particular county. I was then pushed to know if I would\r\nresign when it appeared to be the sense of the Province in general; I\r\nanswered, that when all the other Councillors had resigned, if it\r\nappeared to be the sense of the Province I should resign, I would\r\nsubmit. They then called for a vote upon the subject, and, by a very\r\ngreat majority, voted my reasons satisfactory. I inquired whether they\r\nhad full power to act for the people, and being answered in the\r\naffirmative, I desired they would take care to acquaint them of their\r\nvotes, that I should have no further application made to me on that\r\nhead. I was promised by the Chairman, and a general assent, it should be\r\nso. This left me entirely clear and free from any apprehensions of a\r\nfarther application upon this matter, and perhaps will account for that\r\nconfidence which I had in the people, and for which I may be censured.\r\nIndeed, it is true, the event proves I had too much; but reasoning from\r\nevents yet to come, is a kind of reasoning I have not been used to. In\r\nthe afternoon I observed large companies pouring in from different\r\nparts; I then began to apprehend they would become unmanageable, and\r\nthat it was expedient to go out of their way. I was just going into my\r\ncarriage when a great crowd advanced, and in a short time my house was\r\nsurrounded by three or four thousand people, and one quarter part in\r\narms. I went to the front door, where I was met by five persons, who\r\nacquainted me they were a Committee from the people to demand a\r\nresignation of my seat at the Board. I was shocked at their ingratitude\r\nand false dealings, and reproached them with it. They excused themselves\r\nby saying the people were dissatisfied with the vote of the Committee,\r\nand insisted on my signing a paper they had prepared for that purpose. I\r\nfound that I had been ensnared, and endeavored to reason them out of\r\nsuch ungrateful behavior. They gave such answers, that I found it was in\r\nvain to reason longer with them; I told them my first considerations\r\nwere for my honor, the next for my life; that they might put me to death\r\nor destroy my property, but I would not submit. They began then to\r\nreason in their turn, urging the power of the people, and the danger of\r\nopposing them. All this occasioned a delay, which enraged part of the\r\nmultitude, who, pressing into my back yard, denounced vengeance to the\r\nfoes of their liberties. The Committee endeavored to moderate them, and\r\ndesired them to keep back, for they pressed up to my windows, which then\r\nwere opened: I could from thence hear them at a distance calling out for\r\na determination, and, with their arms in their hands, swearing they\r\nwould have my blood if I refused. The Committee appeared to be anxious\r\nfor me, still I refused to sign; part of the populace growing furious,\r\nand the distress of my family who heard their threats, and supposed them\r\njust about to be executed, called up feelings which I could not\r\nsuppress; and nature, ready to find new excuses, suggested a thought of\r\nthe calamities I should occasion if I did not comply: I found myself\r\ngiving way, and began to cast about to contrive means to come off with\r\nhonor. I proposed they should call in the people to take me out by\r\nforce, but they said the people were enraged, and they would not answer\r\nfor the consequences. I told them I would take the risk, but they\r\nrefused to do it. Reduced to this extremity, I cast my eyes over the\r\npaper, with a hurry of mind and conflict of passion which rendered me\r\nunable to remark the contents, and wrote beneath the following words:\r\n'My house at Cambridge being surrounded by four thousand people, in\r\ncompliance with their commands, I sign my name, THOMAS OLIVER,' The five\r\npersons took it, carried it to the people, and, I believe, used their\r\nendeavors to get it accepted. I had several messages that the people\r\nwould not accept it with those additions, upon which I walked into the\r\ncourt-yard, and declared I would do no more, though they should put me\r\nto death. I perceived that those persons who formed the first body which\r\ncame down in the morning, consisting of the landholders of the\r\nneighboring towns, used their utmost endeavors to get the paper received\r\nwith my additions; and I must, in justice to them, observe, that, during\r\nthe whole transaction, they had never invaded my enclosures, but still\r\nwere not able to protect me from other insults which I received from\r\nthose who were in arms. From this consideration I am induced to quit the\r\ncountry, and seek protection in the town.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REVOLUTIONISTS MARCHING TO CAMBRIDGE.\r\n\r\nTo oblige Lieutenant-Governor Thomas Oliver to resign from the Council\r\nBoard.]\r\n\r\nThe document presented to Mr. Oliver on the 2d of September, and which\r\nhe signed, was as follows: \"I, Thomas Oliver, being appointed by his\r\nMajesty to a seat at the Council Board, upon, and in conformity to the\r\nlate Act of Parliament, entitled an 'Act for the better regulation of\r\nthe Province of Massachusetts Bay,' which being a manifest infringement\r\nof the Charter rights and privileges of this people, I do hereby, in\r\nconformity to the commands of the body of this county now convened, most\r\nsolemnly renounce and resign my seat at said unconstitutional Board, and\r\nhereby firmly promise and engage, as a man of honor and a Christian,\r\nthat I never will hereafter, upon any terms whatsoever, accept a seat at\r\nsaid Board on the present novel and oppressive plan of Government.\" To\r\nthis, the original form, he added the words above recited. Judge\r\nDanforth and Judge Lee, who were also Mandamus Councillors and Mr.\r\nPhipps, the sheriff, and Mr. Mason, clerk of the county, were compelled\r\nto submit to the same body, and make written resignations.\r\n\r\nGovernor Oliver, as stated by himself, went into Boston, and made\r\nassurances both to General Gage and to the Admiral on the station, which\r\nprevented a body of troops from being sent to disperse the large body of\r\npeople who assembled at Cambridge on this occasion; and to these\r\nassurances it was owing, undoubtedly, that the day passed without\r\nbloodshed. But for the peaceable demeanor of those whom he met in the\r\nmorning,--the landholders of the neighboring towns,--the first collision\r\nbetween the King's troops and the inhabitants of Massachusetts, would\r\nhave occurred, very likely, at Cambridge, and not at Lexington. A\r\ndetachment was sent to the former town the day before, to bring off some\r\npieces of cannon, and from this circumstance arose, principally, the\r\nproceedings related by Governor Oliver. Indignant because the \"redcoats\"\r\nhad been sent upon such an errand, thousands from the surrounding\r\ncountry assembled in the course of the day, (September 2d.) armed with\r\nguns, sticks, and other weapons; and when the Lieutenant-Governor's\r\npromise on his return from Boston, rendered it certain that they would\r\nnot be opposed by the troops, they exacted from every official who\r\nlived at Cambridge full compliance with their demands, as has been\r\nstated.\r\n\r\nFrom this period Governor Oliver lived in Boston, until March, 1776,\r\nwhen at the evacuation he accompanied the Royal Army to Halifax, and\r\ntook passage thence to England.\r\n\r\nHis mansion near Mt. Auburn is the house in which he resided at the time\r\nhe was mobbed by four thousand Disunionists. When Benedict Arnold with\r\nhis Connecticut Company arrived at Cambridge just after the fight at\r\nLexington, they were quartered in this house. After Bunker Hill the\r\nhouse became a hospital and the dead were buried in the opposite field.\r\nThe mansion was afterwards the residence of Governor Gerry, and at a\r\nlater period was owned and occupied by Prof. James Russell Lowell, which\r\nmade it still more famous under the name of \"Elmwood.\"\r\n\r\nHe was proscribed and banished in 1778 and in the year following was\r\nincluded in the Conspiracy Act, and his large estate confiscated. Though\r\nhe forfeited his estates in Massachusetts, he was better situated\r\nfinancially than most of his fellow sufferers, for he was wealthy from\r\nhis professions in the West Indies, still owned by his descendants. He\r\nwas a studious man and lived in retirement in England. He died at\r\nBristol, Nov. 29, 1815, aged 82, and left six daughters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PETER OLIVER.\r\n\r\n                 CHIEF JUSTICE OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter Oliver, son of Daniel Oliver and brother of Andrew Oliver, the\r\nLieutenant Governor, born in 1713, married Mary, daughter of William\r\nClark. His son Peter, Jr., married Sarah, daughter of Governor\r\nHutchinson. Peter Oliver, Sr., graduated from Harvard College in 1730.\r\nHe received the degree of L.L. D. He was appointed to the supreme bench\r\nof the province, September 15, 1756.\r\n\r\nAn affair happened at the close of the year 1773, which drove Adams and\r\nall his factions into madness. It was a grant from the King of a salary\r\nto the judges of the Supreme Court. The Assembly had endeavoured to keep\r\nthe judges in absolute dependence upon their humor and because they\r\nfound them rather too firm to coincide with their views in the\r\nsubversion of government, they made them the object of their resentment.\r\nThe judges of the Court had the shortest allowance from the General\r\nAssembly of any publick officers, even their Doorkeeper had a large\r\nstipend. The judges' travel on their circuits were from 1100 to 1500\r\nmiles in a year. Their circuit business engrossed seven months of the\r\nyear during the extremes of heat and cold in a severe climate. For all\r\ntheir service, the highest grant made to them was L120 sterling per\r\nyear, and it had been much less; the Chief Justice had L30 sterling\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty taking the cases of the judges into consideration, and from\r\nhis known justice and benevolence, ordered their salaries to be paid out\r\nof his revenues in America, such salaries as would keep them above want,\r\nand below envy. The judges upon hearing of His Majesty's intention of\r\nsuch a grant had agreed to accept it, but four of them who lived at and\r\nnear the focus of tarring and feathering, the town of Boston flinched in\r\nthe day of battle, they were so pelted with soothings one day, and with\r\ncurses and threatenings the next, that they prudentially gave the point\r\nup. The Chief Justice was now left alone in the combat, his brethren had\r\nbut lately been seated on the Bench. He had been 17 years in the\r\nservice, and had sunk more than L2000 sterling in it. He had offered not\r\nto accept of the grant (if His Majesty would permit him to do so),\r\nprovided the Assembly would reimburse him one-half of his loss in their\r\nservice, and for this he would resign his seat on the Bench. The Chief\r\nJustice very luckily lived at Middleborough, about 30 miles from Boston,\r\nor perhaps he would have followed suit of his brethren in giving up the\r\nKing's grant. A message was sent to him by the Lower House signed\r\n\"Samuel Adams, Clerk,\" requiring him to make explicit answer whether he\r\nwould accept of the King's grant, or of their grant. He replied that he\r\nshould accept the King's grant. Nothing less than destruction now\r\nawaited him. Col. Gardner, who was afterwards killed at Bunker Hill,\r\ndeclared in the General Assembly, that he himself would drag the Chief\r\nJustice from the Bench, if he should sit upon it.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly voted that he had rendered himself obnoxious to the people,\r\nas an enemy, and immediately presented a petition for his removal.\r\nArticles of impeachment for high crimes and misdemeanors were exhibited,\r\nwhich Gov. Hutchinson refused to countenance. The grand jury at\r\nWorcester on April 19th following, presented to the court a written\r\nrefusal to serve under the Chief Justice, considering it illegal for him\r\nto preside until brought to answer to the above mentioned charges. He\r\nbecame a refugee in 1775, and died at Birmingham, England, in October\r\n1791, aged 79.[155] Of the five judges of the Superior Court of\r\nMassachusetts at the commencement of the Revolution, four remained\r\nloyal, viz., Peter Oliver, Edmund Trowbridge, Foster Hutchinson, and\r\nWilliam Browne. The Revolutionary member of the Court was William\r\nCushing. Judges at this time wore swords, ermine robes, etc., while on\r\nthe Bench.\r\n\r\n  [155] Curwin's Journal, p. 516.\r\n\r\nDR. PETER OLIVER. Second son of Chief Justice Oliver, of Massachusetts,\r\ngraduated at Harvard University in 1761. He dwelt at Middleborough,\r\nPlymouth County. He had practised in Scituate in early life, was one of\r\nthe eighteen country gentlemen who were driven into Boston and who were\r\nAddressers of General Gage in 1775. He was proscribed and banished in\r\n1778, and became a refugee in England, where he died at Shrewsbury, in\r\nSept. 1822, aged eighty-one.\r\n\r\nDANIEL OLIVER, son of Chief Justice Oliver, a learned and accomplished\r\nlawyer of Worcester County, graduated at Harvard College in 1762. A\r\nrefugee loyalist of the Revolution, he died at Ashted, Warwickshire, May\r\n6, 1826, aged 82. His father was an antiquarian, and copied with his own\r\nhand Hubbard's manuscript History of New England, which the son refused\r\nthe loan of to the Massachusetts Historical Society for publication in\r\ntheir Collection.[156]\r\n\r\n  [156] Curwin's Journal, p. 510.\r\n\r\nSabine says that it was Doctor Oliver who refused to lend his copy or at\r\nleast to permit a transcript of such parts of it as were missing in the\r\nAmerican manuscript. In consequence, we have \"Hubbard\" mutilated at the\r\nbeginning, and at the end. At this time, 1814, when the Massachusetts\r\nHistorical Society with the aid of the Legislature desired to publish\r\nthat work, there was a very bitter feeling towards the United States on\r\naccount of the war at that time existing between the two countries.\r\n\r\nANDREW OLIVER of Salem, son of Lieutenant Governor Oliver, graduated at\r\nHarvard College in 1749. Studied law. Was often a representative to the\r\nassembly and a judge of the Court of Common Pleas. He was one of the\r\nfounders of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a member of\r\nthe American Philosophical Society at Philadelphia; he was considered\r\none of the best scholars of his day, and possessed fine talents. Judge\r\nOliver was never fond of public life, but ardently attached to his books\r\nand friends. He was honored with a commission of mandamus councillor,\r\nwhich he declined. He married Mary, daughter of Chief Justice Lynde, and\r\nmany of his descendants are now living here, for although Judge Oliver\r\nwas a loyalist, he was the only member of his family that was not driven\r\nout of his country in consequence of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nPETER OLIVER of Salem, the son of Lieutenant Governor Andrew Oliver, was\r\nan Addresser of Gage in 1775 and was proscribed and banished in 1778. He\r\nbecame a surgeon in the British Army, and died at London in April, 1795.\r\nHis widow afterwards married Admiral Sir John Knight, and died in 1839.\r\n\r\nBRINLEY SYLVESTER OLIVER, another son of Andrew Oliver, graduated at\r\nHarvard in 1774. Later became a surgeon in the British service; was also\r\npurser on the Culloden at the battle of the Nile. He died in 1828.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR FRANCES BERNARD\r\n\r\nBorn in 1712 at Brightwell England. Governor of Massachusetts from 1760\r\nto 1769. Died in England June 16, 1779.

He settled at St. John, New Brunswick, at the peace, and was\r\nthe first Sheriff of the county. His official papers are dated at Parr\r\nor Parr-town, by which names St. John was then known. In 1792, he held\r\nthe office of Marshal of the Court of Vice-Admiralty of New Brunswick.\r\nAt the time of his death, he was Sheriff of the County of St. John, and\r\nTreasurer of the Colony. He died at St. John in 1813, aged 62. His son,\r\nWilliam Sanford Oliver, was a grantee of St. John in 1783, but left New\r\nBrunswick about 1806, and entered the Royal Navy. He rose to the\r\nposition of Captain and was married at Heavitree, in October, 1811, to\r\nMary Oliver Hutchinson, the daughter of Thomas Hutchinson, Jr., who\r\nwas brought to England in 1770 by her father and mother, when she was\r\nbut three years of age. He was put on the retired list in 1844, and died\r\nin England the next year, aged 71.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SIR FRANCIS BERNARD.\r\n\r\n              GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS FROM 1760 TO 1769.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Francis Bernard was descended from Godfrey Bernard of Wansford in\r\nYorkshire, who in the 13th century was a large landowner, whose clearly\r\ndefined armorial bearings were the first of the family entered in the\r\nHeralds College.\r\n\r\nFrancis, the only child of the Rev. Francis Bernard was baptized July\r\n12th, 1712, in the church of Brightwell in Berkshire. He was unfortunate\r\nin losing his father three years later. He became a scholar of St.\r\nPeter's College in 1725, and was admitted as a student to Christ Church,\r\nOxford, later. In 1733 he entered himself a member of the Middle Temple\r\nand was called to the Bar in 1737, and soon after settled at Lincoln as\r\na provincial counsel. Four years later he married Amelia, daughter of\r\nStephen Offley, Esq., of Norton Hill, Derbyshire. In 1744 he was elected\r\nSteward of the City of Lincoln and Deputy Recorder of Boston. In 1745 he\r\nwas appointed Receiver-General of the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln. In\r\n1750 he was admitted Procter of the Consistory Court of the Diocese. The\r\nyears that Francis Bernard spent at Lincoln were probably some of the\r\nhappiest in his life. He was fortunate in his domestic relations, was\r\ndoing well in his profession, and his many accomplishments which were\r\nalways at the service of his friends, rendered him a general favorite in\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nIn 1758 Mr. Bernard decided to seek a larger field for the support of\r\nhis now large family. He was on intimate terms with the second Viscount\r\nBarrington, and his brothers and sisters; they were his wife's first\r\ncousins. It was thus through his influence that Francis Bernard received\r\nthe office of Governor of New Jersey. The new world afforded an opening\r\nfor his sons which meant much to the father. Mr. and Mrs. Bernard and\r\nfour of their children left England in April, 1758. On his arrival in\r\nNew Jersey, he entered into negotiations with the Indians. The war at\r\nthe time raged between England and France rendering the positions of the\r\nIndians peculiarly important. By his address and tact he conciliated the\r\nIndians, and kept them steadfast in their allegiance to England,\r\nGovernor Pownall of Massachusetts being appointed to South Carolina. Mr.\r\nBernard was appointed as his successor. His residence in New Jersey was\r\nremembered as a time of happiness by the governor and his wife. His life\r\nwas gladdened by a sense of the good he was able to achieve, and he was\r\nhopeful for the future, the page written by Thomas Bernard, his son, of\r\nthis period reads like a pleasant fairy tale, but it was soon ended.\r\nNotwithstanding the supposed indignity offered to the colony of\r\nMassachusetts by the appointment of three officers of State by the\r\nCrown, the Constitution remained exceedingly democratic. Thomas Bernard\r\ngives a sketch of its leading features in which he depicts the colony as\r\nforming one of the freest communities in the world.\r\n\r\nGovernor Bernard reached Boston August 2nd, 1760. He was received with\r\ngreat parade and ceremony. At Dedham he was met by Lieutenant-Governor\r\nHutchinson, several of the Council, and Brigadier-General Isaac Royal\r\nand the troops escorted him to his residence at the Province House in\r\nBoston. The Militia was drawn up in the main streets, and salutes were\r\nfired from all the forts and ships in the harbor, and the Governor and\r\nhis family were entertained at a great dinner at Fanueil Hall, was then\r\nescorted to the State House, and to the Kings Chapel where the Governors\r\nwere in the habit of attending.\r\n\r\nGovernor Bernard's nine years' administration in Massachusetts was\r\nduring one of the most interesting periods in American history. When he\r\narrived at Boston he found affairs on an apparently peaceful and\r\nprosperous footing. He stayed till all was in turmoil, and left only\r\njust before the storm broke. The first part of his administration was\r\nvery agreeable. Soon after his arrival Canada was surrendered. The\r\nGeneral Court in an address to the Governor declared that without the\r\nassistance of England the colonies must have fallen a prey to the power\r\nof France, and that without the money sent from England the burden of\r\nthe war would have been too great to bear. For this relief the colonists\r\ngave warm thanks to the king and to parliament, and made the Governor a\r\npresent of the great island of Mount Desert, and voted a costly monument\r\nin Westminster Abbey to Lord Howe, who had fallen in the campaign\r\nagainst Canada.\r\n\r\nMuch harmony prevailed for two or three years, but this happy and\r\nprosperous commencement did not continue. Governor Bernard was soon\r\nclassed with those who were desirous of strengthening the authority of\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\nShortly after Bernard's appointment, Chief Justice Sewall died on\r\nSeptember 11. He was a great loss to the Province and it was a\r\nmisfortune that his death occurred just at this time. Colonel Otis, as\r\nhe was generally called, desired to succeed to this office. It was\r\nbelieved that he and his son were not friendly to the government.\r\nGovernor Bernard, who had no doubt studied the affairs in Massachusetts,\r\nconsidered Colonel Otis to be wholly unsuited to the position of a Chief\r\nJustice, and determined not to appoint him. Thomas Hutchinson, the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, an able and intelligent man, was appointed to the\r\nimportant office of Chief Justice. Governor Bernard had at once realized\r\nHutchinson's qualities and said many years later, when they were both\r\nliving in England, that he had never repented appointing Hutchinson\r\nChief Justice.[157]\r\n\r\n  [157] Hutchinson's Diary & Letters. Vol. 1, p. 195.\r\n\r\nLynde, the senior judge, who did not care particularly to succeed\r\nSewall, appears to have been satisfied with the appointment of\r\nHutchinson, also Gridley, the leader of the Bar, and apparently all\r\npossible rivals, save Colonel Otis. Hutchinson discharged the duties of\r\nhis new office in the most satisfactory manner. He proved himself to be\r\nefficient, and always kind, as evinced by his special attention to the\r\nclaims of the helpless.\r\n\r\nAt this time, there were mutterings of a possible storm, and at this\r\ncritical moment, in October of 1760, George II died. Just previous to\r\nhis death Mr. Pitt, Secretary of State, sent a dispatch to the Governor\r\ntouching on the trade of England and her American colonies. The\r\norganized system of smuggling that existed in the Colonies caused the\r\nCustom House officers to apply for the \"writs of assistance,\" that were\r\nfrequently employed in England.\r\n\r\nSo far the Governor's course had been hampered only by factious\r\nopposition from the chief offenders, but this opposition assumed\r\nformidable dimensions when the question of \"writs of assistance\" was\r\nbrought forward. The rights of the Custom House officers to demand such\r\nhelp was tried before the Supreme Court of Massachusetts. \"The verdict\r\nwas in their favor, but public opinion was strongly excited, and James\r\nOtis, the lawyer who opposed the Custom House officers, gained great\r\npopularity.\"[158] Notwithstanding Otis' eloquence, the case as already\r\nsaid was decided against his clients on the point of law. Governor\r\nBernard was only performing his duty when he was active in promoting\r\nseizures for illicit trade.\r\n\r\n  [158] Doyle's History of America, Ch. XVIII.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of his early life in Boston, Julia Bernard, Governor\r\nBernard's youngest daughter, mentions their home in Boston as \"the\r\nGovernment House.\" She says that they employed both black and white\r\nservants, and speaks of the formalities that existed while the family\r\nlived there. \"In Boston, none of the family, grown up brothers excepted,\r\never walked out in the town. We had a large garden, but it seemed rather\r\na confinement.\" She also speaks of her father's home at Jamaica Pond.\r\n\"This residence we usually moved to in May I think, and here we enjoyed\r\nourselves extremely. We ran pretty much at liberty; there was no form or\r\nceremony. My father was always on the wing on account of his situation.\r\nHe had his own carriage and servants, my mother hers; there was a town\r\ncoach, and a whiskey for the young men to drive about. I was used from a\r\nchild to ride on horseback, and from childhood none of us had any fear\r\nof anything.\" Speaking of these days she says, they \"all seemed great,\r\nenlightened, and enjoyable.\"\r\n\r\nIn describing her parents Julia Bernard says: \"My father, though not\r\ntall, had something dignified and distinguished in his appearance and\r\nmanner; he dressed superbly on all public occasions. My mother was tall,\r\nand a very fine woman. Her dresses were ornamented with gold and silver,\r\nermine, and fine American sable.\"\r\n\r\nThe Province House was visited about the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury by Nathaniel Hawthorne, who has written interesting but\r\nmelancholy pages on the subject.[159]\r\n\r\n  [159] For description of House, see \"The Bernards of Abington and Nether\r\n  Winchendon,\" by Mr. N. Higgins, Vol. I. p. 285.\r\n\r\nThe Province or Government House occupied by Sir Francis Bernard was\r\nsituated nearly opposite the head of Milk street. It was purchased by\r\nthe Colonial Legislature in 1716, of the widow of Peter Sargent, who\r\nbuilt it. It was a magnificent building, no pains had been spared to\r\nmake it not only elegant, but also spacious and convenient. It stood\r\nback some distance in its ample lot, and had the most pleasant and\r\nagreeable surroundings of any mansion in town. It was of brick, three\r\nstories in height, with a high roof and lofty cupola. The house was\r\napproached over a stone pavement and a high flight of massive stone\r\nsteps, and through a magnificent doorway. Two stately oaks of very large\r\nsize, reared their verdant tops on either side of the gate separating\r\nthe grounds from the highway, and cast a grateful shade over the\r\napproach, through the beautiful grass lawn in front of the mansion.\r\n\r\nAfter the evacuation of Boston the Province House and all other\r\nGovernment property was confiscated and became the property of the\r\nState. In 1811 the State gave the property to the Massachusetts General\r\nHospital who leased it for ninety-nine years. Stores were erected in\r\nfront of it. In 1864 it was destroyed by fire and only the walls are all\r\nthat remain of the Old Province House. The engraving shown here was made\r\nfrom a sketch of it taken a short time before it was leased and altered.\r\nThe Royal Arms, and the Indian vane are on exhibition in the Old State\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Bernard's country mansion was situated on the southwest side\r\nof Jamaica Pond, fronting on Pond street, now a part of the Boston Park\r\nsystem. This was and still is a most lovely spot. The mansion house was\r\nsurrounded with an estate of sixty acres. Here, but for the gathering\r\nclouds which darkened the political horizon, the remaining years of this\r\nscholarly and able representative of the government might have been\r\npassed in the enjoyment of all that seemed the most enjoyable in life--a\r\ndelightful home, set in a lovely landscape, and the esteem and regard of\r\nthe people he had governed. His extensive and beautiful grounds were\r\nfilled with choice fruit trees, plants and shrubs including one hundred\r\norange and lemon trees besides fig, cork, cinnamon and other rare\r\nexotics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD PROVINCE HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nAfter Bernard went to England, it was occupied by the second Sir William\r\nPepperell, until he too was driven out by the disunionists. Then came\r\nthe siege and the occupation of loyalist dwellings by the\r\nrevolutionists, this being the quarters of Col. Miller of Rhode Island,\r\nin the summer of 1775. Afterwards it was used as a hospital for the camp\r\nat Roxbury. The soldiers who died were buried on elevated ground some\r\ndistance back from the buildings. The governor's hot house was taken by\r\nMajor Crane and converted into a magazine for the artillery. Confiscated\r\nby the State in 1779, it was bought by Martin Brimmer, a Boston\r\nmerchant, who died here in 1804. Capt. John Prince purchased it in 1806,\r\nin 1809 took down the old house, a part of which had stood one hundred\r\nand forty-one years, and no doubt many a bumper of good wine had been\r\ndrunk to the health of the seven sovereigns of Great Britain, who had\r\nreigned during that period.\r\n\r\nCaptain Prince made a road through the property from Pond to Perkins\r\nstreet, now known as Prince street; the whole estate was divided up into\r\ngood sized building lots, on which many elegant residences have since\r\nbeen erected. In front of one of them are some fine large English elms\r\nprobably planted by Gov. Bernard. One of them measures twenty-five feet\r\nin circumference.[160]\r\n\r\n  [160] The Town of Roxbury. Francis S. Drake.\r\n\r\nGovernor Bernard soon after his arrival in Massachusetts became much\r\ninterested in Harvard College, and his interests extended far beyond the\r\nformalities required of him in his official capacity. \"Having regard to\r\nthe Governor's delight in Latin verse, it is not surprising that he\r\nshould have endeavored to refine and soften the somewhat rugged type of\r\nstudent which Harvard then produced.\" He suggested that the college\r\nshould follow the custom established in the English universities, of\r\nwriting poetical tributes in commemoration of public events. Thirty-one\r\npoems were written. Of these nine were by the Governor himself in Greek\r\nand Latin, and the others owed their existence to the stimulus of prizes\r\noffered by him. It was a difficult undertaking for him to start this\r\ncustom. A recent writer (Mr. Goddard) styles this volume, indeed, \"the\r\nmost ambitious typographical and literary work attempted on the\r\ncontinent previous to the Revolution, etc.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Bernard's interest and exertion for the development of the\r\nmaterial resources of his province should have won him lasting\r\ngratitude. He encouraged with all his power the manufacture of potash,\r\nthe cultivation of hemp and flax on waste lands, and the carriage of\r\nlumber to British markets.\r\n\r\nThe Province prospered under Bernard during these years preceding the\r\nStamp Act, and peace came through his ability and guidance. Mr.\r\nHutchinson writes: \"If at the expiration of that term he had quitted the\r\ngovernment, he would have been spoken of as one of the best of the New\r\nEngland Governors.\" His son Thomas, also remarked upon his popularity\r\nduring these five out of the nine years he presided as Governor of\r\nMassachusetts. The House of Representatives, conscious that Mr. Bernard\r\nhad expended a considerable sum of his own money in improving the\r\ncastle, and for other public benefits, passed a resolution that the\r\nisland of Mount Desert, lying on the northeastward of Penobscot Bay, be\r\ngranted to him and his heirs and assigns. The Council at once concurred\r\nin the grant. The confirmation of the Assembly's grant of Mount Desert\r\nwas contained in a letter from the English Lords of Trade, dated May 21,\r\n1763.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1763 [writes Thomas Bernard], orders were transmitted to the\r\nAmerican Governors for carrying into strict execution the laws of trade,\r\nat the same time notifying the new authority which had been delegated to\r\ncommanders of the King's ships stationed in America, to seize all\r\nvessels concerned in any prohibited commerce. These were followed by\r\nfurther orders for improvement of the revenue, and for suppression of\r\nall clandestine and illicit trade with foreign nations; with directions\r\nfor the Governors to transmit such information as they had to\r\ncommunicate on the subject.[161]\r\n\r\n  [161] Life of Sir Francis Bernard.\r\n\r\nGovernor Bernard was compelled in the discharge of his official\r\nfunctions to enforce these commands, but he lost no time in\r\nremonstrating. His letter to the Earl of Egremont, Secretary of State,\r\ncontains a plea for the indulgence granted, or tacitly allowed up to\r\nthat time, with regard to wine and fruit, especially lemons, which he\r\nconsidered necessary to health in the climate of Massachusetts. This\r\nletter was followed by another addressed to the Lords Commissioners for\r\nTrade and Plantations, in which he entreats that the duties imposed by\r\nthe Molasses Act may at least be reduced in the interest of England as\r\nwell as of America, since it had been, and would be evaded, and its end\r\nto a large extent defeated. He continues: \"this Act has been a perpetual\r\nstumbling block to the Custom House officers, and it will be most\r\nagreeable to them to have it in any way removed.\"[162]\r\n\r\n  [162] \"The Bernards of Abington and Nether Winchendon,\" by Mr. Napier\r\n  Higgins.\r\n\r\nIt was not until Bernard left America that the colonists knew of his\r\nprotest to the government. A large number evidently were satisfied at\r\nhis good will and perhaps suspected that he interceded in their favour,\r\nso their regard for him survived the trial of the new orders from\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this agitation, the smallpox broke out in the capital,\r\nand the Governor was compelled to move the General Assembly to\r\nCambridge. Here in January, 1764, another misfortune occurred. Harvard\r\nHall was burned to a heap of ruins, the only one of the ancient\r\nbuildings which still remained. Of five thousand volumes, only a hundred\r\nwere saved, and of John Harvard's books, but a single one.\r\n\r\nThe Governor at once appealed to the Assembly and obtained a vote for\r\nreconstruction. He set the example of contributing towards a new library\r\nby the gift of some of his own books; he also drew the architectural\r\ndesign for the new building and superintended its execution.\r\nSubscriptions were made both in England and America for the erection of\r\nthe new hall.\r\n\r\nIn June 1763, a confederation of several Indian tribes had suddenly and\r\nunexpectedly swept over the whole western frontier of Pennsylvania and\r\nVirginia, had murdered almost all the English settlers, and through\r\nunusual skill captured every British fort between the Ohio and Lake\r\nErie, and had closely blockaded Fort Detroit and Pittsburg. After\r\ndesperate fighting, the troops under Amherst succeeded in repelling the\r\ninvaders and secured the three great fortresses of Niagara, Detroit and\r\nPittsburg. The severe fighting appears to have been done by the English\r\ntroops. Massachusetts seemed to be fatigued from the late war and could\r\ngive no help when aid was asked. Connecticut finally sent 250 men. Peace\r\nwas signed in September, 1764, the war having lasted fourteen months,\r\nmonths of extreme horror. The credit of the war belonged to the English\r\nsoldiers, another great service rendered to the colonies by England.\r\n\r\nEngland felt that the colonies should help share the great expense of\r\nthe late wars. George Grenville as First Lord of the Treasury, and\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, signalized his period of administration by\r\nthe Stamp Act. On the 10th of March the House of Commons on the motion\r\nof the Minister, passed a variety of resolutions respecting certain\r\nduties on foreign goods imported into the British colonies of America.\r\n\r\nGrenville remarked in his honest way to the colonial agents in London,\r\n\"I am not, however, set upon this tax. If the Americans dislike it, and\r\nprefer any other method, I shall be content. Write therefore, to your\r\nseveral colonies, and if they choose any other mode, I shall be\r\nsatisfied, provided the money be but raised.\"[163]\r\n\r\n  [163] Samuel Adams (Hosmer) Ch. VI.\r\n\r\nThe British Government gave the colonies a year to deliberate, and the\r\nHouse of Representatives trusted Governor Bernard to plead for the\r\ncolonists. When the members met again on January 10, 1765, the Governor\r\nhonestly stated how much he had done. On January 14 began in the British\r\nParliament the vehement and eloquent debates, ending in a majority of\r\nboth Houses declaring in favour of the Stamp Act. The Ministry seems to\r\nhave paid no attention to Governor Bernard's suggestion. His \"Principles\r\nof Law and Polity\" were ignored and also the Petition of the Assembly.\r\nOn March 22, 1765, the Stamp Act received the Royal Assent, and England\r\nand her colonies were divided.\r\n\r\nWhen the Colonists learned that the hated act had been passed, they\r\nbecame defiant. Riots soon took place in Boston, and Secretary Oliver,\r\nwho was appointed by the British government as Stamp Distributor, was\r\nhung in effigy. This was during the summer of 1765 when the first cargo\r\nof stamps was daily expected. Then came the attack upon Mr. Oliver's\r\nhouse, and the complete destruction of Mr. Hutchinson's home.[164]\r\n\r\n  [164] For further information concerning the Stamp Act, see pp. 40, 41,\r\n  42.\r\n\r\nDuring the warm months the Governor and his family were in the habit of\r\nresiding at the castle. They were there when the stamps were expected\r\nand during the riotous times in Boston. The night that Hutchinson's home\r\nwas destroyed seems to have made a deep impression on Julia Bernard,\r\nthen in her sixth year. She afterwards wrote:\r\n\r\n\"While the family was resident at Castle William, my father came one\r\nnight in his barge from Boston and brought Lieutenant-Governor\r\nHutchinson, his sister, and two daughters, whom he had thus rescued from\r\nthe fury of the mob. They had forced the house; the family fled for\r\ntheir lives; my father's barge was in waiting for him and he took them\r\nunder his protection. The house was stripped of everything, and pulled\r\ndown that night. They had nothing but what they had on. I can remember\r\nmy mother getting them out clothes, and ordering beds to be prepared.\r\nTerror and distress sat upon their countenances.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Bernard assured the people he had their interest at heart, but\r\nhis road was a difficult one, and he was greatly worried over the\r\nperformance of his duty. Because he represented the government, he was\r\nabused and insulted, and finally felt that he had no real authority, but\r\nwas totally in the hands of the people. His son quotes his father's\r\nwords: \"Although I have never received any orders concerning the Stamp\r\nAct until this day, nor even a copy of the Act, I have thought it my\r\nduty to do all I could to get it carried into execution. And I must say\r\nin so doing I have exerted all possible spirit and perseverance.... I\r\nhave made great sacrifices to his Majesty's service upon this occasion.\r\nMy administration, which before was easy, respectable, and popular, is\r\nrendered troublesome, difficult, and dangerous, and yet there is no\r\npretext to charge me with any other offence than endeavoring to carry\r\nthe Stamp Act into execution; but that is here an high crime never to be\r\nforgiven.\" The struggle was carried on without intermission, but towards\r\nthe end of April, Boston was delighted by the news of the repeal of the\r\nStamp Act. \"Letters published in England,\" writes Hutchinson, \"Allowed\r\nthat Governor Bernard's letters to the Ministry, and the petition from\r\nthe Council and House in 1764, which had been drawn by the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, forwarded the repeal. But they had no merit with\r\nthe prevailing party, because they solicited the repeal as a matter of\r\nfavour, and not as a claim of right.\"\r\n\r\nGreat rejoicings now took place in the city and for a while Governor\r\nBernard's life became a little easier.\r\n\r\nIn August 1768, the King offered the Governor a Baronet's title, which\r\nhe accepted. Rule and order was vanishing in Massachusetts. On September\r\n28, 1768, two regiments from Halifax with artillery, arrived off Boston,\r\nand the vessels which brought them, cast anchor in Nantasket Roads, a\r\nfew miles below Castle William. The troops were landed on Saturday,\r\nOctober 1, and on Saturday, October 15, General Gage arrived with his\r\nofficers to look after the quartering of the troops himself, a difficult\r\nproblem to solve in this divided community. Thus was the Governor\r\nplaced, trying to fulfil his duty to England, and yet always with the\r\nbest interest of the people at heart. Commodore Hood wrote to Mr.\r\nStephens, Secretary to the Admiralty on November 25, 1768, stating that\r\n\"The General [Gage] and Governor Bernard have been lately burnt in\r\neffigy, in a most public manner.\"\r\n\r\nAll through the next winter a fierce controversy raged in the newspapers\r\nregarding England and her colonies. Samuel Adams was the most prolific\r\nand forcible writer, and his contributions went also to newspapers at a\r\ndistance. In the spring of this year the Governor became \"Sir Francis\r\nBernard of Nettleham, in the county of Lincoln, Baronet.\" The patent\r\nbears the date April 5, 1769. The King had ordered the expense of the\r\npatent to be paid out of his privy purse, and this according to the\r\nGovernor's son, was a compliment seldom offered.\r\n\r\nThe grant of the baronetcy was accompanied by an order summoning Sir\r\nFrancis Bernard to proceed to England and there report on the state of\r\nhis province. Ere long the Governor and the whole body of loyalists were\r\nstruck with consternation by the intelligence that General Gage had\r\nordered the removal of the troops from Boston. They considered this\r\nextremely dangerous.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of January, 1770, a town meeting was held by which every one\r\nwas declared an enemy who had in any way assisted in obtaining or\r\nretaining troops. Sir Francis Bernard was making preparations for his\r\ndeparture, and this of course, was intended as a parting shot. He\r\nyielded to the advice of friends to attend the Harvard Commencement as\r\nusual and Mr. Hutchinson says that, \"When he had gone through it without\r\nany insult worth notice from the rude people, who always raise more or\r\nless tumult on that day, he thanked his friends for their advice.\" It is\r\nsatisfactory to think that his last public appearance in Massachusetts\r\nwas at Harvard, the institution he had always felt such a deep interest\r\nin.\r\n\r\nA few days before the Governor departed, he received a circular from the\r\nEarl of Hillsborough announcing the intended repeal of the duties on\r\nglass, paper and paint, and one of his last acts of administration\r\nconsisted in making this intention known, and the assurance of the good\r\nwill of the British Government for the American colonies. Governor\r\nBernard then bequeathed the administration to Lieutenant-Governor\r\nHutchinson and made his last farewells.\r\n\r\n\"He embarked on board the Rippon, a man-of-war ordered from Virginia to\r\nconvey him, and sailed for England. Instead of the marks of respect\r\ncommonly shown, in a greater or less degree, to governors upon their\r\nleaving the province, there were many marks of public joy in the town of\r\nBoston. The bells were rung, guns were fired from Mr. Hancock's wharf,\r\nLiberty Tree was covered with flags, and in the evening a great bonfire\r\nwas made upon Fort Hill.\"[165] The Governor sailed on August 1, 1769, a\r\nsad ending to nine years of laborious and anxious administration.\r\nPerhaps there were some staunch friends with him to the last in whose\r\nsympathy he found consolation for sights and sounds which must have\r\njarred upon his feelings, and were of set purpose arranged to aggravate\r\nhis sorrow in parting, for an indefinite time, from his nearest and\r\ndearest. Hosmer, the biographer and eulogist of Samuel Adams, speaks of\r\nFrancis Bernard as \"an honourable and well-meaning man, and by no means\r\nwanting in ability.\"\r\n\r\n  [165] Hutchinson Hist. Mass., Vol. III., p. 253.\r\n\r\nThomas Bernard, who accompanied his father, states that he was\r\ngraciously received in England and by George III. A petition arrived\r\nfrom the colonies asking for a new governor, it concludes:\r\n\r\n\"Wherefore we most humbly entreat your Majesty that his Excellency Sir\r\nFrancis Bernard, Baronet, may be forever removed from the government of\r\nthis province, and that your Majesty would be graciously pleased to\r\nplace one in his stead worthy to serve the greatest and best Monarch on\r\nearth.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor's resignation soon followed. His life was filled with much\r\nanxiety for the financial welfare of his family as during his eleven\r\nyears of residence in America, his private fortune had not been\r\nincreased. He received a pension, but many troubles arose which greatly\r\ntaxed his physical and mental strength. Mrs. Bernard and the remaining\r\nmembers of her family, moved from their country home at Jamaica Pond,\r\nwhich was afterwards occupied by Sir William Pepperell, to a new\r\nresidence called the Cherry House, which the Governor caused to be built\r\non a lot of land containing about 30 acres on the \"Road leading to\r\nCastle William\" at Dorchester Neck, now South Boston. The Governor\r\nprobably selected this location on which to build his house on account\r\nof its nearness to Castle Island, to which he and his family could take\r\nrefuge in case of mob violence.[166] John Bernard's name continued for\r\nsome time to head the list of proscribed traders and his position,\r\nentailing loss, insult, and even danger, must have been a constant\r\nsource of apprehension to his relatives. After learning that her husband\r\nhad definitely resigned, Lady Bernard prepared to join him in England.\r\nMany of their household possessions were sold at the Province house on\r\nSeptember 11. Just before the vessel sailed, young Francis Bernard died\r\nNovember 20, 1770, at the age of twenty-seven, and is probably buried\r\nbeside his brother Shute in the burial ground of the King's Chapel at\r\nBoston. Mrs. Bernard was accompanied by four of her children, Amelia,\r\nWilliam, Scrope and Julia.\r\n\r\n  [166] One lot of 261/2 acres was purchased of John Baker et al. in\r\n  1762. Lib. 98, Fol. 113. Another lot adjoining same, of 3 acres of James\r\n  Baker in 1764. Lib. 102, Fol. 39. During a raid made by the \"Ministerial\r\n  Troops\" from the Castle on Feb. 13th, 1776, nearly all the houses on the\r\n  Neck were burnt; among them was \"An House and Stable and Barn belonging\r\n  to Francis Bernard burnt; valued at L100.00,\" also damage done \"by our\r\n  Soldiers,\" L40.00. (See New Eng. Gen. Reg. Jan. 1897.) This tract of\r\n  land extended from Fourth street (Way leading to Castle William) to\r\n  Dorchester Bay, M street running through the center of it. The writer's\r\n  father in 1858 purchased a portion of this land, and it was here he\r\n  spent his boyhood days. After the war another house was erected on the\r\n  site of the one burnt; its location was on Fourth street between M and N\r\n  streets. The writer remembers that a boyhood companion that lived there\r\n  picked up in the garden an English guinea.\r\n\r\nSir Francis took a house in the vicinity of Hampstead and for a while\r\nthe family was united, the children from America joining those in\r\nEngland. The two youngest had never seen their eldest sisters, Jane and\r\nFrances, who had remained in the mother country. A short time later, Sir\r\nFrancis suffered from a paralytic stroke and his recovery was partial\r\nand imperfect. Realizing this, he applied for leave to resign his\r\nappointment to Ireland, having been appointed to the Irish Board of\r\nCommissioners. This was granted him in 1774, and his former pension\r\nrestored to him. The vigor of his mental faculties is evinced by the\r\nfact that on July 2, 1772, he went to Oxford and received the degree of\r\nD. C. L. and from Christ Church the honour of having his picture by\r\nCopley among other illustrious students in the Hall of that society.\r\n\r\nAfter a stay at Nether Winchendon, the family removed to the Prebendal\r\nHouse at Aylesbury, and now for a short period enjoyed comparative\r\npeace. The colonies were in open revolt. Soon after Governor\r\nHutchinson's arrival in England, he resumed his habits of friendly\r\nintercourse with Sir Francis Bernard and his family. Thomas Bernard\r\nstudied for the Bar, and William and Scrope were sent to Harrow. Jane,\r\nthe eldest daughter, married Charles White, a barrister, in 1774. Fanny,\r\nthe third daughter, became greatly attached to her newly found sister\r\nJulia, and proved herself very capable with her pen. Scrope later\r\nentered Christ Church at Oxford and William embarked for Canada. John\r\nleft England for America probably in 1775. William, who was a Lieutenant\r\nin the army, was drowned before reaching Canada. He was on board a\r\nprovision ship bound for Quebec which took fire, and he, with some\r\nothers, took to a boat which overset and they all were drowned. This\r\ncast a gloom over the family, from which the father and mother never\r\nfully recovered.\r\n\r\nA London visit of Sir Francis and Lady Bernard in March, 1777, is\r\nmentioned by Governor Hutchinson.\r\n\r\n\"8th.--Sir Francis and Lady came to town last evening, and dined with us\r\nto-day, with Paxton, Dr. Caner, Chandler, and Boucher.\"\r\n\r\nLater came Lady Bernard's death and Hutchinson in his \"Dairy,\" 1778,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"2nd.--Lady Bernard died last week, the 20th. [May], at Aylesbury.\r\nPaxton was there on a visit. She had been in poor health several months,\r\nbut took an airing the day before the night in which she died, or rather\r\ntowards morning.\"\r\n\r\nThis remarkable woman was married to Sir Francis Bernard thirty-seven\r\nyears and had shared every vicissitude of his career. She had felt the\r\ncares of his agitated public life in America and had seen him gradually\r\nbroken down by much trouble, not the least of which was the final blow\r\nreceived in England at the hands of supposed friends.\r\n\r\nThomas, who was now eight and twenty, relieved his father from business\r\ncares, and became a worthy head to the family. News reached England of\r\nthe act of banishment. John Bernard had reached America before the\r\nDeclaration of Independence and lived in a remote part of Maine, but his\r\nname does not appear among the proscribed. News of the Confiscation Act\r\ndid not reach Sir Francis before his death, and Thomas says that his\r\nlast days were free from anxiety on that ground. He died believing in\r\nthe honesty of America.\r\n\r\nThe engagement of Julia Bernard about this time to the Rev. Joseph\r\nSmith, brought a gleam of happiness into the family.\r\n\r\nOn June 21, Hutchinson writes:\r\n\r\n\"A gentleman, who knew me and asked how I had been since he last saw me,\r\ninformed me Saturday morning, as I was taking my morning walk, that he\r\nwent to Aylesbury a day or two before, and that Sir Francis Bernard died\r\nWednesday night, the 16, [1779], which has since been confirmed.\"\r\n\r\nHe suffered from several complaints, and an epileptic fit more violent\r\nthan any he had had before, hastened the end. He died surrounded by his\r\nchildren, within a month of completing his sixty-seventh year, and was\r\nburied by the side of Lady Bernard in a vault under Aylesbury church.\r\nSir Francis Bernard's memory was held in high honor by his children, and\r\nby none more tenderly than Thomas, his father's companion and confidant.\r\nAfter his father's death, Thomas wrote:\r\n\r\n\"May his children contemplate with pleasure and confidence, the talents\r\nand probity of their father, and, soothed with the memory of his\r\nvirtues, forget the return which those virtues have received! And may\r\nthey, by retracing the events of his life, strengthen and fortify their\r\nminds, that if ever they should be called to such a trial as he\r\nunderwent, they may imitate him in the conscientious and honourable\r\ndischarge of their duty, and in integrity of life.\"[167]\r\n\r\n  [167] Life of Sir Francis Bernard, by One of his Sons.\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN BERNARD, on the death of his father, succeeded to the Baronetcy\r\nin 1779. When, in 1769, Sir Francis was recalled from the government, he\r\npossessed a large landed estate in Maine of which the large island of\r\nMount Desert, which was given him by the Colony, and afterwards\r\nconfirmed by the Crown, was a part. He also owned Moose Island, now\r\nEastport, and some territory on the mainland. John, at the time of his\r\ndeparture, had an agency for the sale and settlement of these and other\r\nlands, and until the war commenced, was in comfortable circumstances. In\r\norder to hold his property and prevent its confiscation, he remained in\r\nthe country, and therefore it could not be claimed that he was an\r\nabsentee, or a refugee, and as he did not take any part in the\r\ncontroversy, it could not be claimed that he was an enemy to the new\r\ngovernment. His place of residence during the war appears to have been\r\nat Bath, Machias, and at Pleasant Point, a few miles from Eastport. An\r\nunbroken wilderness was around him. The only inhabitants at the head of\r\nthe tidewater of the St. Croix were a few hunters and Indians. He lived\r\nin a small hut built by himself, with no companions but a dog.\r\nRobbinston and Perry were uninhabited, Eastport contained but a single\r\nfamily, yet at the spot now occupied by the remnant of the Passamaquoddy\r\nIndians, he attempted to make a farm. He had been bred in ease and\r\nrefinement, had hardly done a day's laborious work in his life, yet he\r\nbelieved he could earn a competence by labor. He told those who saw him\r\nthat \"other young men went into the woods, and made themselves farms,\r\nand got a good living, and he saw no reason why he could not.\" But he\r\ncut down a few trees, became discouraged, and after the confiscation of\r\nthe property of Sir Francis in 1778, he was in abject poverty, and the\r\nmisfortune of himself and family seemed to have unsettled his mind.\r\nAfter the peace, he lived at Pleasant Point, and occasionally went to\r\nBoston. His abject condition in mind and estate rendered him an object\r\nof deep commiseration, and his conduct during hostilities having\r\nentitled him to consideration, the Legislature of Massachusetts restored\r\nto him one half of his father's estate, which included one half of the\r\nisland of Mount Desert, and an estate in Boston consisting of wharves,\r\nland, and flats, which he sold for L600 to Wm. Allen. Of his subsequent\r\nhistory while he continued in the United States, but little is known.\r\nLater in life he held offices under the British Crown at Barbadoes and\r\nSt. Vincent. He died in the West Indies in 1809 in his sixty-fifth year,\r\nwithout issue, and was succeeded by his brother Thomas.\r\n\r\nSIR THOMAS BERNARD, the third surviving son of Sir Francis, succeeded\r\nhis brother John to the Baronetcy. He took his degree from Harvard\r\nCollege in 1767. After he took up his residence in England, much of his\r\ntime was devoted to institutions of benevolence in London, and he wrote\r\nseveral essays with a design to mitigate the sorrows, and improve the\r\ncondition of the humbler classes of English society. The University of\r\nEdinburgh conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Laws. He married a\r\nlady of fortune who died in 1813 while preparing to go to church.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas' account of his father's life makes him stand out perhaps the\r\nmost prominent of Sir Francis' children. His death occurred in England\r\nin 1818. The Baronetcy of Sir Francis Bernard now stands in the name of\r\nMorland.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of Sir Francis Bernard's confiscated property in\r\nSuffolk County situated in what is now South Boston, and Jamaica Plain,\r\ntogether with the name of the purchasers. He had also much property in\r\nMaine, including one half of Mount Desert island, that was confiscated.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONFISCATED PROPERTY OF SIR FRANCIS BERNARD SITUATED IN SUFFOLK COUNTY.\r\n\r\n     To Martin Brimmer, Aug. 18, 1779; Lib. 130 fol. 178; Farm, 50 A.,\r\n       mansion house and barn in Roxbury, highway to Benj.

He acquired property and removed to\r\nKittery on the mainland, where he died in 1734, leaving an only son of\r\nhis own name, who continued the business of fishing, amassed great\r\nwealth, and arrived at great honors. It is interesting and instructive\r\nto trace the rising steps of the Pepperell family, from a destitute\r\nyoung fisherman to the princely affluence and exalted station, civil,\r\npolitical, and military, to which his son arrived. It throws light upon\r\nthe early history of the infant colonies, the character of the early\r\nsettlers, the nature of their occupations, their commerce, the\r\ncondition, and relative importance of places of trade, and the influence\r\nof the times, and events, in forming the character and shaping the\r\nfortunes of the illustrious subject of this memoir. The name once so\r\ncelebrated, has in America long since become extinct, and but for its\r\nrecord in the page of history, would ere this have passed into oblivion.\r\nTo account for this curious fact, it will be necessary to give a more\r\nextended notice of the history of the family than would otherwise seem\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nWhile a fisherman at the Isle of Shoals, Pepperell had frequent occasion\r\nto sail to Kittery Point for the purpose of traffic, and for the\r\npurchase and repair of boats. A shipwright there named John Bray\r\nwelcomed him to his home, and supplied his wants. He had a daughter\r\nMargery, who had arrived at the age of seventeen when she first saw Mr.\r\nPepperell, who was smitten with her youthful charms. At the time of this\r\nmarriage Mr. Pepperell removed from the Shoals to Kittery Point, where\r\nMr. Bray gave him the site of the present Pepperell mansion. The south\r\npart of this structure was built by him and the north part by his son\r\nSir William, who was born here in 1696, and here dwelt the two families\r\ntill the decease of the father in 1734, which left the son's family sole\r\noccupants till 1759. The home has since been curtailed in its dimensions\r\nby the removal of ten feet from each end of the building. It was during\r\nthis period of little more than half a century that the largest fortune,\r\nthen known in New England, was gradually accumulated. The principal\r\nbusiness of the Pepperells was done in the fisheries. They sometimes had\r\nmore than one hundred small vessels at a time on the Grand Banks.\r\nShip-building was also a very extensive branch of industry on the\r\nPascataqua, and its tributary streams. The Pepperells built many vessels\r\nand sent them to the West India islands, laden with lumber, fish, oil,\r\nand live stock, to exchange for cargoes of rum, sugar, and molasses, for\r\nhome consumption; others to European markets to exchange for dry goods,\r\nwine, and salt, and to sell both vessel and cargo. To the Southern\r\ncolonies fish was sent in exchange for corn, tobacco, and naval stores.\r\nMills were erected by them on the small rivers, and lumber and\r\nship-timber, were floated down to Kittery Point, and Newcastle, to be\r\nshipped to European and American ports.\r\n\r\nSir William was his only son. About 1727 he was elected a member of the\r\nCouncil of Massachusetts, and held a seat in that body by annual\r\nelection for thirty-two years, until his death. He was also selected to\r\ncommand a regiment of militia, and being fond of society, rich, and\r\nprosperous, was highly popular, and possessed much influence. With a\r\nvigorous frame, firm mind, and great coolness, when in danger, he was\r\nwell fitted for his residence in a country exposed to ferocious enemies.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Utrecht which secured Nova Scotia to the British Crown,\r\ngave France undisputed right to Cape Breton. Here they built the city of\r\nLouisburg at enormous cost, and protected it with fortresses of great\r\nstrength. The walls of the defences were formed with bricks brought from\r\nFrance, and they mounted two hundred and six pieces of cannon. The city\r\nhad nunneries, and Palaces, gardens, and squares, and places of\r\namusement, and was designed to become a great capital, and to perpetuate\r\nFrench dominion, and the Catholic faith in America. Twenty-five years of\r\ntime and six million dollars in money were spent in building, arming,\r\nand adorning this city, \"The Dunkirk of the New World.\" That such a plan\r\nexisted, at so early a period of our history, is a marvel, and the\r\nlovers of the wonderful may read the works of Parkman which contain\r\naccounts of its rise, and ruin, and be satisfied that \"truth is\r\nsometimes stranger than fiction.\"\r\n\r\nThe possession of this stronghold by the French was a source of\r\ncontinual annoyance to the New England fishermen, and at last became\r\nintolerable. Situated as it was directly off the fishing grounds, it\r\nmeant destruction to the fishing interest every time there was a war\r\nwith France. At last its capture was seriously conceived and undertaken.\r\nGovernor Shirley, in 1744, listening to the propositions made to him on\r\nthe subject, submitted them to the Legislature of Massachusetts, and\r\nthat body in secret session, the first ever held in America, authorized\r\na force to be raised, equipped, and sent against it, and the command was\r\nconferred upon Colonel William Pepperell. His troops consisted of a\r\nmotley assemblage of fishermen, and farmers, sawyers, and loggers, many\r\nof whom were taken from his own vessels, mills, and forests. Before such\r\nmen, and others hardly better skilled in war, in the year 1745,\r\nLouisburg fell. The achievement is the most memorable in the Colonial\r\nannals. For this great service Colonel Pepperell was created a Baronet\r\nin 1746. After the fall of Louisburg, he went to England and was\r\npresented at Court. In 1759 he was appointed Lieutenant-General. He died\r\nthe same year at his seat at Kittery, aged sixty-three years, and was\r\nburied in the large and beautiful tomb erected in 1734 which was placed\r\nnear the mansion home. His children were two, Andrew, a son who\r\ngraduated at Harvard University in 1743, and died March 1, 1751, aged\r\ntwenty-five, and a daughter, Elizabeth, who married Colonel Nathaniel\r\nSparhawk. Lady Pepperell, who was Mary Hirst, daughter of Grove Hirst of\r\nBoston, and granddaughter of Judge Sewall of Massachusetts, survived\r\nuntil 1789. Mrs. Sparhawk bore her husband five children, namely\r\nNathaniel, William Pepperell, Samuel Hirst, Andrew Pepperell, and Mary\r\nPepperell. Sir William, her father, soon after the decease of her\r\nbrother, executed a will, by which after providing for Lady Pepperell,\r\nhe bequeathed the bulk of his remaining property to herself, and her\r\nchildren. Her second son was made the residuary legatee, and inherited a\r\nlarge estate. By the terms of his grandfather's will he was required to\r\nprocure an Act of the Legislature to drop the name of Sparhawk, and\r\nassume that of Pepperell. This he did on coming of age, and was allowed\r\nby a subsequent Act, to take the title of Sir William Pepperell,\r\nBaronet. He received the honors of Harvard University in 1766,\r\nsubsequently he visited England, and became a member of the Council of\r\nMassachusetts. In 1774 when that body was recognized under the Act of\r\nParliament, he was continued, under the mandamus of the King, and\r\nthereby incurred the wrath of the disunionists, who at a county\r\ncongress, held at Wells, York County, Maine, on the 16th of Nov. 1774,\r\ndeclared a boycott against him, and denounced him in the following\r\nmanner: \"The said William Pepperell, Esq., hath, with purpose to carry\r\ninto force, Acts of the British Parliament, made with apparent design to\r\nenslave the free and loyal people of this country, accepted, and now\r\nholds, a seat in the pretended Board of Councillors in this Province, as\r\nwell as in direct repeal of the charter thereof, as against the solemn\r\ncompact of kings, and the inherent right of the people. It is therefore\r\nResolved, that said William Pepperell, Esq. hath thereby justly\r\nforfeited the confidence, and friendship of all true friends to American\r\nliberty, and with other pretended councillors, now holding their seats\r\nin like manner, ought to be detested by all good men, and it is hereby\r\nrecommended to the good people of this country, that as soon as the\r\npresent leases made to any of them by said Pepperell, are expired, they\r\nimmediately withdraw all connection, commerce, and dealings, from him,\r\nand they take no further lease, or conveyance of his, farms, mills, or\r\nappurtenances thereunto belonging (where the said Pepperell is the sole\r\nreceiver and appropriator of the rents and profits), until he shall\r\nresign his seat, pretendedly occupied by mandamus. And if any persons\r\nshall remain, or become his tenants, after the expiration of their\r\npresent leases, we recommend to the good people of this country, not\r\nonly to withdraw all connections, and commercial intercourse with them,\r\nbut to treat them in the manner provided by the third resolve of this\r\nCongress.\"\r\n\r\nThe Baronet not long after this denouncement retired to Boston. His\r\nwinter residence was on Summer street, near Trinity church, and his\r\ncountry residence was an estate on the southerly side of Jamaica Pond\r\ncontaining sixty acres, which he leased from Sir Francis Bernard. In\r\n1775 he arrived in England under circumstances of deep affliction. Lady\r\nPepperell, who was Elizabeth, daughter of Hon. Isaac Royall, of Medford,\r\nhaving died on the passage. In 1778 he was proscribed and banished, and\r\nthe year following was included in the Conspiracy Act. In May, 1779, the\r\nCommittee on confiscated estates offered for sale \"his large and elegant\r\nhouse, gardens, and other accommodations, &c., pleasantly situated on\r\nSummer street, Boston, a little below Trinity church.\" His vast domain\r\nin Maine, the largest owned by any individual in New England, though\r\nentailed upon his heirs, was confiscated. This estate extended from\r\nKittery to Saco, with a coast line of upwards of thirty miles, and\r\nextending back many miles into the interior, and, for the purposes of\r\nfarming and lumbering, was of great value, and the water power and mill\r\nprivileges, rendered it even at the time of the sequestration, a\r\nprincely fortune. His possessions were large in Scarboro, Elliot,\r\nBerwick, Newington, Portsmouth, Hampton and Hubbardston. In Saco alone\r\nhe owned 5,500 acres, including the site of that populous town and its\r\nfactories. A large portion of this property was purchased by Thomas\r\nCutts who had served as a clerk in Sir William's counting room. He was\r\nactive during the revolution, was a noted merchant, president of a bank,\r\ncolonel of a regiment, senator in the Massachusetts Legislature, and one\r\nof the founders of the Massachusetts General Hospital. He died in 1821.\r\n\r\nAll of Sir William's brothers were loyalists and were forced to leave\r\nthe country, and their vast domains passed into other hands. A life\r\ninterest or dower right in the Saco lands was enjoyed by Lady Mary\r\nPepperell, the widow of the first Sir William and her daughter, Mrs.\r\nSparhawk, which was devised to them by the Baronet's will. In exchange\r\nfor the right thus arising, the State afterwards assigned two-ninths in\r\nabsolute property to Lady Pepperell and her daughter, by a deed executed\r\nin 1788. This small portion of this great estate was saved through these\r\nladies residing in the country during the war, the \"sons of despotism\"\r\ncould hardly tar and feather two defenceless women, or drive them forth\r\nas they did their sons and brothers, and make absentees or refugees of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThus the princely fortune of Pepperell, that required a century to\r\nconstruct, from the foundation laid by John Bray the shipwright to the\r\nmassive structure raised by the fisherman William Pepperell and\r\ncompleted by his son Sir William, fastened and secured though it was, by\r\nevery instrument that his own skill and the best legal counsel could\r\ndevise to give stability and perpetuity, was in a brief hour overthrown,\r\nand demolished by the confiscation act of 1778. So complete was the\r\nwreck that two of his daughter's grandsons, were saved from the\r\nalmshouse by the bounty of some persons on whom they had no claim for\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\nNever before in the history of this country has there been a more\r\nconspicuous fall of a family from a high estate. There has always been a\r\ndoubt as to the legality of the Confiscation Act, as far as the\r\nremainder or reversionary interest, of the first Sir William was\r\nconcerned, since it is apparently clear that the life-interest of the\r\nsecond Sir William could only be, or by the statute actually was,\r\ndiverted and passed to the State.[168]\r\n\r\n  [168] This question was decided in the case of Roger Morris of New York\r\n  who married Mary, daughter of Frederick Phillips, who it is said had\r\n  previously refused George Washington, the estate which belongs in right\r\n  to his wife was confiscated, and that the whole interest should pass\r\n  under the Act Mrs. Morris was included in the attainder. Humanity is\r\n  shocked that a woman was attainted of treason, for no crime but that of\r\n  clinging to the fortunes of the husband whom she had vowed on the altar\r\n  never to desert. However, in the year 1809, their son, Captain Henry\r\n  Gage Morris of the Royal Navy, in behalf of himself and his two sisters,\r\n  sold their reversionary interest to John Jacob Astor of New York for the\r\n  sum of L20,000 sterling. In 1828 Mr. Astor made a compromise with the\r\n  State of New York by which he received for the rights thus purchased by\r\n  him, the large sum of five hundred thousand dollars, having obtained a\r\n  judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States affirming the\r\n  validity and perfectibility of his title.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the first Sir William, his widow, Lady Pepperell,\r\ncaused a neat house to be erected near that of her daughter, and the\r\nvillage church which still remain. Here she died in 1789 after being a\r\nwidow thirty years.\r\n\r\nThis house came into the possession of Captain Joseph Cutts. He was a\r\nlarge ship owner and a successful merchant. Ruined by Mr. Jefferson's\r\nembargo, and the war of 1812, he lost his reason, and his two sons also\r\nwent insane. One fell by his own hand in Lady Pepperell's bedchamber,\r\nthe other was so violent at times that it was necessary to chain him.\r\nUnder these misfortunes the daughter Sally's reason gave way. The town\r\nallowed a small sum for the board of her father, and her brother. Her\r\nhome even was sold to satisfy a Government claim for duties owed by her\r\nfather. It would seem that the doom of the Pepperells was transmitted to\r\nall who should inhabit this house. Surely a blight seemed to have fallen\r\nupon it which consumed the lives and fortunes of a family until its evil\r\ndestiny was fully accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe old mansion built by the first Colonel Pepperell, and enlarged by\r\nhis son, is plain in its architecture, and contained a great many rooms\r\nbefore it was curtailed ten feet from each end. It was well adapted to\r\nthe extensive domains and hospitalities of its former owners. The lawn\r\nin front extends to the sea, and the restless waves over which Sir\r\nWilliam successively sought fortune and fame, still glitter in the\r\nsunbeams, and dash around the disconsolate abode. The fires of\r\nhospitality are extinguished. It is now occupied by the families of poor\r\nfishermen who do not like to be troubled with visitors or strangers. The\r\nhall is spacious and well finished; the ceiling is ornamented, and the\r\nrichly carved bannisters bear traces of former elegance. The large hall\r\nwas formerly lined with some fifty portraits of the Pepperell and\r\nSparhawk families and of the companions in arms of Sir William, such as\r\nAdmiral Sir Peter Warren Commodore Spry and others. We have now no\r\nsympathy with the joyous acclamations once bestowed on these successful\r\nvictors returning from the field of glory to be crowned with laurels.\r\nThe American people feel no desire to perpetuate the fame of their\r\nachievements, although characterized at the time by patriotism as pure,\r\nand disinterested as any exhibited since this government was formed.\r\nPatriotism in those days implied loyalty and fidelity to the king of\r\nEngland, but how changed the meaning of that word in New England after\r\nthe Declaration of Independence? Words and deeds before deemed\r\npatriotic, were now traitorous, and so deeply was the idea of their\r\nmoral turpitude impressed on the public mind, as to have tainted popular\r\nopinion concerning the heroic deeds of our ancestors performed in the\r\nking's service, in the French wars, but criticism of this is apt to\r\nproduce what Coleridge declared the cold waters of reason thrown on the\r\nburning embers of democracy inevitably produced--namely a hiss. The\r\nRevolution absorbed and neutralized all the heroic fame of the\r\nillustrious men that preceded it. The extinction of their fame was not\r\nmore remarkable than the wreck of their fortunes. The Penns, Fairfaxes,\r\nJohnsons, Phillips, Robinsons and Pepperells were stripped of their\r\nimmense possession, by confiscation, who up to that time had been but\r\nlittle less than hereditary noblemen and viceroys of boundless domains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PEPPERELL MANSION.]\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolution the Baronet was treated with great respect and\r\ndeference by his fellow exiles in England. His home in London was open\r\nfor their reception, and in most cases in which the Loyalists from New\r\nEngland united in representations to the ministry or to the throne, he\r\nwas their chairman or deputed organ of communication. He was allowed\r\nL500 sterling per annum by the British Government, and this stipend,\r\nwith the wreck of his fortune, consisting of personal effects, rendered\r\nhis situation comfortable, and enabled him to relieve the distress of\r\nthe less fortunate. And it is to be recorded in respect for his memory,\r\nthat his pecuniary benefactions were not confined to his countrymen who\r\nwere in banishment, for their loyalty, but were extended to his\r\ncountrymen who were disloyal, who languished in England in captivity\r\nsharing with them the pension which he received from the government,\r\nafter their government had despoiled him of all his great possessions.\r\nIt is to be remembered, too, that his private life was irreproachable,\r\nand that he was among the founders of the British and Foreign Bible\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nIn 1779 the Loyalists then in London formed an Association, and Sir\r\nWilliam was appointed President. The first meeting was held at Spring\r\nGarden Coffee House, May 29th, 1779, and the next at the Crown and\r\nAnchor, in the Strand on the 26th. About ninety persons met at this\r\nplace composed of Loyalists from each Colony. A Committee appointed at\r\nthis meeting, on July 6th, reported an Address to the King. In this\r\ndocument it is said, that, \"notwithstanding your Majesty's arms have not\r\nbeen attended with all the effect which those exertions promised, and\r\nfrom which occasion has been taken to raise an indiscriminate charge of\r\ndisaffection in the Colonists, we beg leave, some of us from our own\r\nknowledge, and others from the best information, to assure your Majesty\r\nthat the greater number of your subjects in the Confederated Colonies,\r\nnotwithstanding every art to seduce, every device to intimidate, and a\r\nvariety of oppressions to compel them to abjure their sovereign,\r\nentertain the firmest attachment and allegiance to your Majesty's sacred\r\nperson and government. In support of those truths, we need not appeal to\r\nthe evidence of our own sufferings; it is notorious that we have\r\nsacrificed all which the most loyal subjects could forego, or the\r\nhappiest could possess. But, with confidence, we appeal to the struggles\r\nmade against the usurpations of Congress, by Counter Resolves in very\r\nlarge districts of country, and to the many unsuccessful attempts by\r\nbodies of the loyal in arms, which have subjected them to all the rigors\r\nof inflamed resentment; we appeal to the sufferings of multitudes, who\r\nfor their loyalty have been subjected to insults, fines, and\r\nimprisonments, patiently enduring all in the expectation of that period\r\nwhich shall restore to them the blessings of your Majesty's Government;\r\nwe appeal to the thousands now serving in your Majesty's armies, and in\r\nprivate ships-of-war, the former exceeding in number the troops enlisted\r\nto oppose them; finally, we make a melancholy appeal to the many\r\nfamilies who have been banished from their once peaceful habitations; to\r\nthe public forfeiture of a long list of estates; and to the numerous\r\nexecutions of our fellow-citizens, who have sealed their loyalty with\r\ntheir blood. If any Colony or District, when covered or possessed by\r\nyour Majesty's troops had been called upon to take arms, and had\r\nrefused; or, if any attempts had been made to form the Loyalist militia,\r\nor otherwise, and it had been declined, we should not on this occasion\r\nhave presumed thus to address your Majesty; but if, on the contrary, no\r\ngeneral measure to the above effect was attempted, if petitions from\r\nbodies of your Majesty's subjects, who wished to rise in aid of\r\nGovernment, have been neglected, and the representations of the most\r\nrespectable Loyalists disregarded, we assure ourselves that the equity\r\nand wisdom of your Majesty's mind will not admit of any impressions\r\ninjurious to the honor and loyalty of your faithful subjects in those\r\nColonies.\"\r\n\r\nSir William Pepperell, Messrs. Fitch, Leonard, Rome, Stevens, Patterson,\r\nGalloway, Lloyd, Dulaney, Chalmers, Randolph, Macknight, Ingram, and\r\nDoctor Chandler, composing a committee of thirteen, were appointed to\r\npresent this Address. At the same meeting it was resolved, \"That it be\r\nrecommended to the General Meeting to appoint a Committee, with\r\ndirections to manage all such public matters as shall appear for the\r\nhonor and interest of the Loyal in the Colonies, or who have taken\r\nrefuge from America in this country, with power to call General\r\nMeetings, to whom they shall from time to time report.\" Of this\r\nCommittee, Sir Egerton Leigh, of South Carolina, was Chairman. This body\r\nwas soon organized. On the 26th of July, Mr. Galloway, of Pennsylvania,\r\nwho was a member of it, reported rules for its government, which, after\r\nbeing read and debated, were adopted. The proceedings of this Committee\r\ndo not appear to have been very important; indeed, to meet and\r\nsympathize with one another, was probably their chief employment. On the\r\n2d of August, it was, however, \"Resolved, That each member of the\r\nCommittee be desired to prepare a brief account of such documents,\r\nfacts, and informations, as he hath in his power, or can obtain,\r\nrelating to the rise, progress, and present state of the rebellion in\r\nAmerica, and the causes which have prevented its being suppressed, with\r\nshort narratives of their own, stating their facts, with their remarks\r\nthereon, or such observations as may occur to them; each gentleman\r\nattending more particularly to the Colony to which he belongs, and\r\nreferring to his document for the support of each fact.\" This resolution\r\nwas followed by another, having for its design to unite with them the\r\nLoyalists who remained in America, in these terms: \"Resolved, That\r\ncircular letters be transmitted from the Committee to the principal\r\ngentleman from the different Colonies at New York, informing them of the\r\nproceedings of the General Meeting, the appointment and purposes of this\r\nStanding Committee, and requesting their co-operation and\r\ncorrespondence.\"\r\n\r\nAugust 11, 1779, at a meeting of the Committee, report was made that\r\nGeneral Robertson had been \"so obliging as to undertake the trouble of\r\ncommunicating to our brethren in New York our wishes to have an\r\ninstitution established there on similar principles to our own, for the\r\npurpose of corresponding with us on matters relative to the public\r\ninterests of British America.\" Whereupon it was resolved, that, in place\r\nof the circular letter resolved upon on the 2d, \"a letter to General\r\nRobertson, explanatory of our designs and wishes, and entreating his\r\ngood offices to the furtherance of an establishment of a Committee at\r\nNew York, be drawn up and transmitted.\" At the same meeting, (August\r\n11th,) Sir William Pepperell stated that Lord George Germain had been\r\napprised of the proceedings of the \"Loyalists for considering of\r\nAmerican affairs in so far as their interests were concerned, and that\r\nhis Lordship had been pleased to declare his entire approbation of their\r\ninstitution.\"\r\n\r\nThe framing of the letter to General Robertson, above mentioned, seems\r\nto have been, now, the only affair of moment, which, by the record,\r\noccupied the attention of the Association. It may be remarked, however,\r\nthat agreeably to the recommendation above stated, a Board of Loyalists\r\nwas organized at New York, composed of delegates from each Colony.\r\nAnother body, of which the Baronet was President, was the Board of\r\nAgents constituted after the peace, to prosecute the claims of Loyalists\r\nto compensation for their losses by the war, and under the Confiscation\r\nActs of the several States. Sir James Wright, of Georgia, was first\r\nelected, but at his decease, Sir William was selected as his successor,\r\nand continued in office until the Commissioners made their final report,\r\nand the commission was dissolved. Sir William's own claim was of\r\ndifficult adjustment, and occupied the attention of the Commissioners\r\nseveral day. In 1788, and after Mr. Pitt's plan had received the\r\nsanction of Parliament, the Board of Agents presented an Address of\r\nthanks to the King for the liberal provision made for themselves and the\r\npersons whom they represented, which was presented to his Majesty by the\r\nBaronet. On this occasion, he and the other Agents were admitted to the\r\npresence, and \"all had the honor to kiss his Majesty's hand.\" As this\r\nAddress contains no matter of historical interest, it is not here\r\ninserted. But some mention may be made of West's picture, the \"Reception\r\nof the American Loyalists by Great Britain in 1783,\" of which an\r\nengraving is here shown. The Baronet is the prominent personage\r\nrepresented, and appears in a voluminous wig, a flowing gown, in advance\r\nof the other figures, with one hand extended and nearly touching the\r\ncrown, which lies on a velvet cushion on a table, and holding in the\r\nother hand, at his side, a scroll or manuscript half unrolled.\r\n\r\nThe full description of this picture is as follows: \"Religion and\r\nJustice are represented extending the mantle of Britannia, whilst she\r\nherself is holding out her arm and shield to receive the Loyalists.\r\nUnder the shield is the Crown of Great Britain, surrounded by Loyalists.\r\nThis group of figures consists of various characters, representing the\r\nLaw, the Church, and the Government, with other inhabitants of North\r\nAmerica; and as a marked characteristic of that quarter of the globe, an\r\nIndian Chief extending one hand to Britannia, and pointing the other to\r\na Widow and Orphans, rendered so by the civil war; also, a Negro and\r\nChildren looking up to Britannia in grateful remembrance of their\r\nemancipation from Slavery. In a Cloud, on which Religion and Justice\r\nrest, are seen in an opening glory the Genii of Great Britain and of\r\nAmerica, binding up the broken fasces of the two countries, as\r\nemblematical of the treaty of peace and friendship between them. At the\r\nhead of the group of Loyalists are likenesses of Sir William Pepperell,\r\nBaronet, one of the Chairmen of their Agents to the Crown and Parliament\r\nof Great Britain; and William Franklin, Esq., son of Dr. Benjamin\r\nFranklin, who, having his Majesty's commission of Governor of New\r\nJersey, preserved his fidelity and loyalty to his Sovereign from the\r\ncommencement to the conclusion of the contest, notwithstanding powerful\r\nincitements to the contrary. He was arrested by order of Congress and\r\nconfined for two years, when he was finally exchanged. The two figures\r\non the right hand are the painter, Mr. West, the President of the Royal\r\nAcademy, and his lady, both natives of Pennsylvania.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RECEPTION OF THE AMERICAN LOYALISTS IN ENGLAND.]\r\n\r\nSir William continued in England during the remainder of his life. He\r\ndied in Portman Square, London, in December, 1816, aged seventy.\r\nWilliam, his only son, deceased in 1809. The baronetcy was inherited by\r\nno other member of the family, and became extinct. His daughters were\r\nElizabeth, who married the Rev. Henry Hutton, of London; Mary, the\r\nwife of Sir William Congreve; and Harriet, the wife of Sir Charles\r\nThomas Palmer, Baronet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARREST OF WILLIAM FRANKLIN BY ORDER OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST ROYAL GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY, SON OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN]\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL SPARHAWK, brother of the second Sir William Pepperell, was\r\nborn August, 1744. Graduated at Harvard University in 1765. He was an\r\nAddresser to Gov. Gage and went to England where he remained till 1809,\r\nwhen he returned, and died in Kittery, 1814. His two sons never married,\r\nand were by the kindness of their neighbors saved from the almshouse, on\r\naccount of their noble ancestor, being great grandsons of the elder Sir\r\nWilliam Pepperell.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL HIRST SPARHAWK, also brother to Sir William Pepperell, graduated\r\nat Harvard University in 1771, an Addresser to both Hutchinson and Gage.\r\nSubsequently he went to England with his family of four persons. He died\r\nat Kittery, August 29, 1789, aged thirty-eight. He left an only\r\ndaughter, Miss Harriet Hirst Sparhawk, who at his request was adopted by\r\nhis sister in Boston, wife of Dr. Jarvis, with whom she lived till the\r\ndeath of that lady in 1815. She afterwards lived at Portsmouth, and\r\nexpended one hundred dollars in repairing the old Pepperell tomb. She\r\nwas the last Sparhawk living of Pepperell blood, in America.\r\n\r\nANDREW SPARHAWK, the fourth son of Colonel Sparhawk, married a Miss\r\nTurner. Was a Loyalist and went to England with his brothers, where his\r\nwife died soon after their arrival, and he died there in 1783, leaving\r\nno children.\r\n\r\nMARY PEPPERELL SPARHAWK, married Dr. Charles Jarvis of Boston, and after\r\nhis death, she passed the remainder of her days at Kittery Point near\r\nthe village church, and nearly opposite the residence of her\r\ngrandmother, Lady Pepperell's dwelling, built after the Baronet's death.\r\nShe died in 1815.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF CONFISCATED ESTATES BELONGING TO SIR WILLIAM PEPPERELL IN\r\n                   SUFFOLK COUNTY AND TO WHOM SOLD.\r\n\r\n     To Thomas Russell, Jan. 2., 1783; Lib. 136, fol. 203; Land and\r\n       dwelling-house in Boston, Summer St. S.; Benjamin Goldthwait E.;\r\n       heirs of Benjamin Cunningham deceased N.; Samuel Whitwell\r\n       W.----Land and Buildings, Summer St. N.; widow Jones W. and N.;\r\n       Joseph Balch W.: John Rowe and Thomas Thompson S.; said Thompson\r\n       W.; John Rowe S.; Zachariah Brigdon E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         JOHN SINGLETON COPLEY\r\n\r\n                              AND HIS SON\r\n\r\n             LORD LYNDHURST, LORD CHANCELLOR OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Singleton Copley of Boston was the son of Richard Copley of County\r\nLimerick, who married Mary Singleton, of Deer Park, County Clare. Her\r\nfather was of a Lancashire house of that name which had settled in\r\nIreland in 1661.\r\n\r\nRichard and Mary came to Boston in 1736, and their son John was born\r\nJuly 3rd, 1737. The father went to the West Indies and died there about\r\nthe time of the birth of his son.\r\n\r\nThe widow of Richard Copley married Peter Pelham, an engraver and\r\nartist, by whom she had one son, Henry Pelham, who followed his father's\r\nprofession. Peter Pelham died in 1751. John S. Copley became one of the\r\nmost famous painters of his time. Without instruction, or master, he\r\ndrew and painted, and \"saw visions\" of beautiful forms and faces which\r\nhe transferred to canvass. His pictures show up the features and the\r\nfigures of the aristocracy of Boston, of a time when there were\r\naristocrats here, so that it has been frequently said that one of these\r\nancestral portraits is a Bostonian's best title of nobility.\r\n\r\nMajor George Washington visited Boston in 1755 and sat to young Copley\r\nfor a miniature. In 1766 Copley sent, without name or address, an\r\nexquisite portrait of his half brother, Henry Pelham, known as the \"Boy\r\nand the Flying Squirrel,\" to Benjamin West, a fellow countryman then\r\nsettled in London with a request to have it placed in the Exhibition\r\nRooms of the Society of British Artists. The attention and admiration\r\nexcited by this wonderful painting were such that the friends of the\r\nartist wrote most warmly to persuade him to go to England for the\r\npursuit of his vocation, and West extended to him a pressing invitation\r\nto his own home. In 1769 he married Susannah Farnum, daughter of Richard\r\nClarke, a wealthy merchant of Boston, and agent of the East India\r\nCompany for their trade in that town. The tie between the artist and his\r\nwife was peculiarly close. We constantly meet her familiar lineaments\r\nthrough the whole course of Copley's works. Now Mary by the manger, with\r\nthe Divine Infant at her breast, in \"The Nativity,\" again in \"The Family\r\nPicture\" and in the fabled scene of Venus and Cupid, or in the female\r\ngroup in \"The Death of Major Pierson,\" dissolved in an agony of grief,\r\nand fear, as they escape from the scene of violence and death.\r\n\r\nThe locality associated with his married life in Boston was a solitary\r\nhouse on Beacon Hill, chosen with his keen perception of picturesque\r\nbeauty. His prophecy has been fully verified that the time would come\r\nwhen that situation would become the favorite site for the homes of the\r\nwealthy. Singular as it may appear the site selected by Copley was the\r\nsame as that selected by William Blackstone, the first settler of\r\nBoston. In after years Copley's thoughts fondly reverted to his early\r\nhome--his farm, he called it--which contained 11 acres on the southwest\r\nside of Beacon Hill, now bounded by Charles, Beacon, Walnut, and Mt.\r\nVernon streets, Louisburg Square and Pinckney street.\r\n\r\nIn 1771 Copley wrote that he was earning a comfortable income. At this\r\ntime, he moved in the best society, where his courtly manners and genial\r\ndisposition made him a general favorite. He was now approaching the\r\ncrucial period of his life. He saw the approaching storm that was soon\r\nto break and deluge his country in blood. He was peculiarly situated,\r\nand in a trying position. It is said that his sympathies were at first\r\nwith the revolutionists, and he acted as an intermediary between them\r\nand his father-in-law, Richard Clarke,[169] to whom the tea was\r\nconsigned, but when the infuriated mob destroyed the tea, and attacked\r\nthe warehouse, and residence of Mr. Clarke, forcing him to flee for his\r\nlife, Copley could no longer tolerate mob rule. His case was like that\r\nof many others of whom it is said \"persecution made half of the king's\r\nfriends.\" These outrages occurred in December 1773. Less than two years\r\nafterwards he wrote to his wife, from Italy, July 1775: \"You know years\r\nago I was right in my opinion that this would be the result of the\r\nattempt to tax the colony; it is now my settled conviction that all the\r\npower of Great Britain will not reduce them to obedience. Unhappy and\r\nmiserable people, once the happiest, now the most wretched. How warmly I\r\nexpostulated with some of the violent 'Sons of Liberty' against their\r\nproceedings, they must remember; and with how little judgment, in their\r\nopinion, did I then seem to speak! But all this is past; the day of\r\ntribulation is come, and years of sorrow will not dry the orphan's\r\ntears, nor stop the widow's lamentations, the ground will be deluged in\r\nthe blood of its inhabitants before peace will again assume its dominion\r\nin that country.\"[170] Copley embarked for England, June 1774, six\r\nmonths after his father-in-law was driven out of Boston by the mob, and\r\none year before the conflict with the mother country commenced. Leaving\r\nhis aged mother, his favorite brother, his wife and children behind him,\r\nhe went to prepare a place of refuge for them from the impending storm.\r\nProbably the desire to visit Europe and behold the work of the great\r\nmasters of the art he loved so well had something to do with leaving his\r\nnative land, to which he was never to return. After travelling and\r\nstudying two years on the Continent, he went back to London, and was\r\nsoon joined by his family. Then began a career of uninterrupted success.\r\nHe became the fashion, and many of the nobility sat to him as did also\r\nthree of the princesses, daughters of George III. Following the fashion\r\nof the day he took up historical painting, which included the death of\r\nMajor Pierson and the death of Chatham (both now in the English National\r\nGallery): The siege of Gibraltar, now in the Guild Hall of London, and\r\nCharles I demanding in the House of Commons, the surrender of the five\r\nimpeached members, which now hangs in the Boston Public Library. \"The\r\ndeath of Major Pierson\" in repelling the attack of the French at St.\r\nHelier's, Jersey, on the 6th of January 1781, was painted in 1783 for\r\nAlderman Boydell, for his gallery. When this was dispersed it was bought\r\nback by Copley, and remained in the house in George Street till Lord\r\nLyndhurst's death, when it was purchased for the National Gallery for\r\n1500 guineas. The woman flying from the crowd in terror, with the child\r\nin her arms, was painted from the nurse of Mr. Copley's family; the\r\nfigure between her and the wall, with the upraised arm, is Mrs. Copley;\r\nthe boy running by the nurse's side is young Copley.\r\n\r\n  [169] Tea Leaves 322, 323, 327, 329.\r\n\r\n  [170] Life of Copley, p 62.\r\n\r\nCopley was an Addresser of Hutchinson in 1774, the year he left Boston,\r\nand in 1776, on his return from Italy to London, he became a member of\r\nthe Loyalist club, for weekly conversation and a dinner. He died at his\r\nresidence in George Street, London, Sept. 9, 1815, aged seventy-eight\r\nand was buried in the tomb belonging to Governor Hutchinson's family in\r\nthe parish church at Croydon, near London. Copley had one son and two\r\ndaughters who lived to maturity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN SINGLETON COPLEY\r\n\r\nBorn in Boston July 3, 1737. Painter to the King. Died in London Sept.\r\n9, 1815.]\r\n\r\nJOHN SINGLETON COPLEY, the younger, was born in Boston May 20, 1772, was\r\nearly destined for his father's profession, and, accordingly he attended\r\nthe lectures of Sir Joshua Reynolds, and Barry, at the Royal Academy.\r\nHe, however, had no inclination to follow in his father's footsteps. He\r\nthrew off his instructors, impatiently declaring that he would not be\r\nknown as the \"son of Copley the painter\" but it should be \"Copley, the\r\nfather of the Lord Chancellor.\" So early did he prognosticate his own\r\nfuture eminence. He was entered 1790 at Trinity College, Cambridge. In\r\nthe mathematical tripos of 1794, was second wrangler, sickness alone\r\npreventing him from obtaining the highest honor of the year. He was also\r\nSmith's Prizeman, won the King William prize, and, the following year,\r\nwas appointed a \"travelling bachelor\" with a grant for three years of a\r\nL100 a year, and, a month later, was elected a fellow of Trinity,\r\nimproved the opportunity to visit Boston, the town of his birth, with\r\nthe ulterior view of regaining the family estates on Beacon Hill, owned\r\nby his father before leaving Boston, more than twenty years before. For\r\nalthough Copley was an Absentee, or Refugee, and therefore had laid\r\nhimself liable to the confiscation of his property, yet, through his\r\nwell known sympathy with the Revolutionists before the commencement of\r\nopen war, and through the assistance of some of his friends, his\r\nproperty, which consisted of the largest landed estate in Boston, had\r\nnot been confiscated. There were however several real estate speculators\r\nwho had profited largely by purchasing the confiscated estates of the\r\nLoyalists for a mere trifle who determined to possess themselves of\r\nCopley's property. Jonathan Mason, and Harrison Grey Otis, made a\r\ncontract with Gardiner Green, who was Copley's agent, to purchase the\r\nsame, without adequate authority from the owner. When the deed was sent\r\nto him for execution he refused to sign it. A bill in equity was\r\nbought to enforce the contract of sale. Copley executed a power of\r\nattorney to his son, when he went to Boston, giving him authority to\r\nsettle the case. He arrived in Boston Jan. 2nd, 1796, and wrote to his\r\nfather: \"The business cannot come on till May. If you can make yourself\r\na subject of the United States you are clear. If otherwise I am not yet\r\nsufficiently informed to say what may be the result, if you are decreed\r\nan alien, but take courage.\" He wrote again in February 27, 1796,\r\nsaying, \"I have, my dear sir, concluded my negotiations with Messrs.\r\nMason, Otis, and others. I have acted for the best. I was very strongly\r\nof the opinion that the event of the contest would be in favor of the\r\nplaintiffs. Your counsel agreed with me in their sentiments upon that\r\nhead.[171] A compromise became, therefore, necessary, and for the\r\nconsideration of $18,450 a deed of release was given, dated February 22,\r\n1796, recorded in Lib. 182, fol. 184, Suffolk Deeds.\"[172]\r\n\r\n  [171] Life of Copley, p. 141.\r\n\r\n  [172] Gleaner Articles, p. 196.\r\n\r\nNo deed of any lands in Boston within a century will compare with this\r\nin importance and interest. Taking into consideration the upland, beach,\r\nand flats, this purchase is at a considerably less rate than $1,000 per\r\nacre. That the son acted wisely his letters prove, but the transaction\r\nwas one of deepest regret to the whole family, and embittered the\r\nremainder of the artist's life.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to his mother from Boston, the young man says: \"Shall I\r\nwhisper a word in your ear? The better people are all aristocrats. My\r\nfather is too rank a Jacobin to live among them. Samuel Adams is\r\nsuperannuated, unpopular and fast decaying in every respect.\" Again he\r\nwrote to his mother from Philadelphia: \"_I have become a fierce\r\nAristocrat._ This is the country to cure your Jacobins. Send them over\r\nand they will return quite converted. The opposition here are a set of\r\nvillains. Their object is to overset the government, and all good men\r\nare apprehensive lest they should be successful. A great schism seems to\r\nbe forming, and they already begin to talk of a separation of the States\r\nnorth of the Potomac from those on the southern side of the river.\"[173]\r\nHe was a visitor at Mount Vernon and spent a week as a guest of the\r\nfirst President of the young Republic.\r\n\r\n  [173] Life of Copley. p. 140, 145.\r\n\r\nAfter nearly two years spent in the new United States, John Singleton\r\nCopley, the younger, returned to what had now become the settled home of\r\nthe Copley family. He commenced a long course of study and systematic\r\npreparation for a life which was to become of the most distinguished,\r\namong the most famous men of the first half of the 19th century. Called\r\nto the bar in 1804 he, with no other influence than that of his own\r\ncommanding talents, soon ranked among the leading men of his profession\r\nand that at a time when an unusually large number of great advocates\r\nwere at the English bar.\r\n\r\nBut it was not at the bar only, or when on the bench at the head of the\r\njudiciary of England that this son of Boston distinguished himself. In\r\nboth houses of Parliament, as Copley or Lyndhurst, he was an\r\nacknowledged leader of men.\r\n\r\nCopley took his seat in the House of Commons as member for Yarmouth in\r\nthe Isle of Wight, in March 1818, and until his removal to the House of\r\nLords, nine years later, sat continuously as a member. Meanwhile\r\npromotion, professionally and politically, was constantly growing. In\r\n1819, he was made a king's sergeant (at large) and chief justice of\r\nChester. In June of the same year he was appointed Solicitor General\r\n(with knighthood), five years later became Attorney General. In 1826 he\r\nsucceeded Lord Gifford as Master of the Rolls, a high judicial office,\r\nwhich at that time and for many years after did not compel the vacating\r\nof a seat in Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe town Council of Bristol unanimously elected him in the same year\r\nRecorder of that city.\r\n\r\nIn April 1827 in his 55th year on the retirement of Lord Chancellor\r\nEldon, the ambition of his life was realized. The great prize of the\r\nlegal profession was offered to him by the express desire of the king\r\nand with it of course a peerage, Sir John Singleton Copley became Baron\r\nLyndhurst of Lyndhurst in the County of Hampshire and, for nearly forty\r\nyears thereafter remained to adorn the House of Lords by his high\r\ntalents, his noble character, and his fervid eloquence.\r\n\r\nLyndhurst's first Chancellorship, was not of long duration. From 1830 to\r\n1834 we find him occupying the chiefship of the Court of Exchequer. He a\r\nstrong tory, had been honored by a whig ministry, in his appointment to\r\nthe office of Lord Chief Baron. This dignified and permanent position he\r\nresigned again to became Chancellor following the passing of the Reform\r\nBill. As Lord Chancellor once more, and for the third time, from 1841 to\r\n1846 he was a member of the ministry of Sir Robert Peel. The fame of the\r\ngreat jurist and statesman had become as precious to the citizens of\r\nBreton, as it was to the mother country. Here in Massachusetts he was\r\nborn, and from his American parents received the first vivid impression\r\nof childhood. The reminiscences of his youth however, were\r\nalways-accompanied by a heartfelt effusion of gratitude that his lot was\r\ncast in England. To London he was especially attached, and used to say\r\n\"that every product known to man, every wonder of art, and skill, which\r\nthe civilized world produced, could be found there.\"[174]\r\n\r\n  [174] Life of Copley, p. 126.\r\n\r\nHe was called the \"Nestor of the House of Lords.\" His speeches were\r\nremarkable for their clearness, vigor, and force, even when he had\r\nreached nearly to his ninetieth year. A portrait of Lord Lyndhurst in\r\nhis Chancellor robes is in the portrait gallery of the New York\r\nHistorical Society. Lord Lyndhurst died October, 1863, in his 92nd year.\r\nLeaving no male heirs, his title died with him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD LYNDHURST, LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nBorn in Boston May 20, 1772. Son of John Singleton Copley. Died in\r\nLondon Oct. 12, 1863.]\r\n\r\nHe married Sarah Geray, daughter of Charles Brunsden, and widow of\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Thomas, who fell at Waterloo. He was the father of\r\nSarah Elizabeth, Susan Penelope, and Sophia Clarence. His second wife,\r\nGeorgiana, daughter of Lewis Goldsmith, bore him a single child,\r\nGeorgiana Susan.\r\n\r\nHis Lordship's eldest sister, Elizabeth Clarke, born in Boston, 1770,\r\nwas educated at a boarding school at Clapham, London, and married\r\nGardiner Greene of Boston, a man of high social standing and business\r\nposition, who had come to Boston from Demerara after the Revolution,\r\nwhere he had accumulated a large fortune. While on a visit to London in\r\nJuly, 1800, he married Miss Copley. She died at Boston in 1866, aged 95\r\nyears. In her will she left to Harvard College a collection of proof\r\ncopies of all of Copley's historical paintings. Her daughter, Martha B.\r\nGreene, born in 1812, married Charles Amory and wrote the Life of John\r\nSingleton Copley, and to this valuable work we are indebted for much of\r\nthe information we have given in this biographical notice. She died in\r\n1880 leaving many descendants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    KING HOOPER OF MARBLEHEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarblehead is a rough peninsular, projecting into the Bay, with craggy\r\nshores, and a narrow harbor a mile and a half in length and a half mile\r\nwide. It is distant about eighteen miles from Boston.\r\n\r\nFrom its peculiar adaptation to fisheries and commerce, though very\r\nlimited in territory, this place was once famous for the hardihood and\r\ndaring enterprise of its citizens. It was the principal fishing port in\r\nall the colonies, and now it does not contain one single fisherman that\r\ngoes to the \"Banks,\" but it has since become the principal yachting\r\ncentre in the United States if not in the world; frequently there will\r\nbe seen gathered here more than five hundred yachts of all classes and\r\ndescriptions.\r\n\r\nIt was naturally a wilderness of rock, with here and there a green\r\nvalley or glade just fitted for a little garden, where the mariner\r\nperched his pretty nest, on the adjacent cliff. No herds or flocks\r\nranged on this barren place. A Marbleheader ploughed only the deep for\r\nhis living, his pasture lay afar off on the Banks of Newfoundland, or\r\nthe Georges, and his harvest whitened the shores with their wide spread\r\nfish flakes. Even at this day, with its cluster of antique dwellings and\r\nrough trapesian streets, this seaport has an odd look, like some ancient\r\ntown in England. But in this secluded spot, where stands the dilapidated\r\nfortresses of Sewall and Lee, several eminent men, merchants, mariners\r\nand lawyers, were born and educated, who became staunch loyalists. They\r\nwere sincere in their convictions and had the courage to declare them in\r\ndefiance of a rough and turbulent population. They could not view the\r\nrevolutionary proceedings of their townsmen without deep concern, and\r\ndoing all in their power to dissuade their fellow-citizens from the\r\ncourse they had taken, they protested that the entire policy of the\r\ncolonies was suicidal and that the town had been guilty of treason by\r\nits action. With a sincere belief that these rebellious acts of the\r\ncolonists must sooner or later bring disaster and ruin upon the country,\r\nand death and imprisonment to the leaders, they entreated their friends\r\nand neighbors to recede from their position before it was too late, but\r\nin vain. It was voted in town meeting that they \"ought not to be\r\nindulged in their wickedness\" and that a committee should be chosen to\r\nattend to the conduct of these ministerial tools and Jacobites, that\r\neffectual measures might be taken \"either for silencing them or\r\nexpelling them from the community\". What brought about this action of\r\nthe Revolutionists was the address to Governor Hutchinson on his\r\ndeparture for England signed by thirty-three of the principal citizens\r\nof the town. Among these names there were five of the name of Hooper,\r\nchief of whom was \"King Hooper,\" the principal merchant in the town. He\r\nhad a high reputation for honor and integrity in his business dealings\r\nand for his benevolence.\r\n\r\nROBERT HOOPER, the first to appear in Marblehead, is first mentioned in\r\nMassachusetts records as master of a shallop hired of Mr. Moses\r\nMaverick, a wealthy business man of Marblehead, in 1663. From a\r\ndeposition he made in court, he was born about 1606. This would make him\r\nold enough to have been the father of John, Robert and Henry Hooper, the\r\nother very early residents of Marblehead. He died after 1686.\r\n\r\nROBERT HOOPER, supposed to be the son of the aforesaid, was born as\r\nearly as 1655. Married Dec. 4, 1684, Anna, daughter of Peter and Hannah\r\nGreenfield. Hannah was a daughter of John and Ann Devereux. He was an\r\ninn keeper and died about 1689.\r\n\r\nGREENFIELD HOOPER, son of the aforesaid, was born about 1686. He resided\r\nat Marblehead, was a merchant. He also had a \"workshop,\" with loom for\r\nweaving. He married, Jan. 16, 1706, Alice, daughter of Andrew Tucker,\r\nSr., and received a share of his real estate. He died about October 1,\r\n1747.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING HOOPER MANSION, DANVERS.\r\n\r\nAt his elegant mansion in Danvers, Robert Hooper entertained General\r\nGage, who made it his headquarters in 1774.]\r\n\r\nROBERT HOOPER, known as \"King Hooper,\" was born at Marblehead, June 26,\r\n1709, son of the aforesaid Greenfield Hooper. He was married four times.\r\nWas a merchant who rose from poverty to apparently inexhaustible wealth,\r\nengrossing for years a large part of the foreign fishing business of\r\nMarblehead, which was very extensive about the year 1760. For awhile he\r\npurchased all the fish brought into that port, sent it to Bilboa and\r\nother parts of Spain and received gold and silver in return, with which\r\nhe purchased goods in England. He owned lands in Marblehead, Salem,\r\nDanvers, and an extensive tract at Lyndeborough, N. H., and elsewhere.\r\nHe had a large and elegant house at Marblehead, and also a mansion at\r\nDanvers, where he did \"royal\" entertaining, rode in a chariot like a\r\nprince, and was ever after known as \"King Hooper.\" He was one of the\r\nwealthiest and most benevolent men in the colony. He presented\r\nMarblehead with a fire engine in 1751.[175]\r\n\r\n  [175] Hooper Genealogy. Curwen's Journal. History of Marblehead.\r\n\r\nAt his elegant house in Danvers he entertained General Gage for some\r\ntime in 1774, and was an Addresser of Hutchinson the same year. He was\r\nappointed representative to the General Court in 1775, and declined a\r\nseat in the Governor's council in 1759 on account of deafness. He was\r\none of thirty-six persons appointed as mandamus councillors of the\r\nprovince in 1774, at the beginning of the agitation that led to the\r\nRevolution, and was one of the twelve that did not accept of the honor,\r\nhis deafness previously referred to being probably the reason, for he\r\nwas a staunch loyalist. This, together with his age and known\r\ngenerosity, prevented his being driven forth from the town; it however\r\ndid not prevent the loss of his great property, for when he died in 1790\r\nhe was insolvent. In a letter dated Marblehead, March 17, 1790,\r\naddressed to his granddaughter Ruth, the wife of Lewis Deblois, a Boston\r\nloyalist residing at St. John, N. B., he says: \"But as you justly\r\nobserve we have been and still are 300 miles distance from each other\r\nand my advanced age make it doubtful whether I may ever see you more in\r\nthis world, your parting from me was next to burying you, there is\r\nnothing would give more pleasure than to hear of the health and\r\nprosperity of every branch of my family.\" This truly great and honorable\r\nman died, a little more than a month after writing this letter. He died\r\nMay 20, 1790, aged 81 years.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH HOOPER, son of the aforesaid, was born at Marblehead, May 29,\r\n1743, married Oct. 30, 1766, Mary, daughter of Benjamin and Lucy\r\n(Devereux) Harris of Newburyport, Nov. 20, 1746. She died at Newburyport\r\nOct. 3, 1796.\r\n\r\nHe graduated from Harvard College in 1763, was a merchant in his native\r\ntown, carrying on a foreign trade. He built the mansion in Marblehead\r\nafterwards occupied by Chief Justice Sewall. He was an Addresser of\r\nGovernor Hutchinson in 1774. Being an ardent loyalist he was forced to\r\nleave his home in 1775 and go to England. He became a paper manufacturer\r\nat Bungay, Suffolk, England, where he died in 1812. The Marblehead\r\nRevolutionary committee recorded May 8th, 1781, that \"they believed he\r\nhad voluntarily gone over to our enemies,\" that is he was a loyalist,\r\nand proceeded to administer on his affairs. One third share was set off\r\nto his wife June 9, 1783, and the balance confiscated and sold. He had\r\ntwo sons and two daughters.\r\n\r\nROBERT HOOPER, son of King Hooper, was born at Marblehead, Feb. 9, 1746,\r\nmarried May 23, 1769, Anna, daughter of Richard and Jemima Corwell. He\r\nwas an Addresser of Governor Hutchinson, but evidently made peace with\r\nthe Revolutionists and was allowed to remain. He died about 1781 at\r\nMarblehead. \"He had usually traded beyond the sea.\"\r\n\r\nSWEET HOOPER, son of King Hooper. Married at Boston, Aug. 4, 1779, Mary,\r\ndaughter of Hector McNeil. He was an Addresser of Governor Hutchinson,\r\nbut was allowed to remain. He was a merchant at Marblehead, died\r\nOctober, 1781.\r\n\r\nROBERT HOOPER, 3d. as described in the Addressers to Governor\r\nHutchinson, was probably a son of Deacon Robert Hooper, cousin to the\r\naforesaid Hoopers. He was born at Marblehead 1757, and married Sept. 21,\r\n1777, Elizabeth, daughter of Rev. Nathaniel Whittaker of Salem. In 1794\r\nhe sold his two-sixths of the mansion house, etc., which had belonged to\r\nhis father, the late Deacon Robert Hooper. He removed to Lexington,\r\nMaine, was master of Limerick Academy. He died May 11, 1836.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             WILLIAM BOWES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNicholas Bowes of Cambridge, Mass., married 26 June, 1684, Sarah\r\nHubbard, who died 26 Jan. 1686, and for second wife married 6 May, 1690,\r\nDorcas Champney, and a third wife, Martha Remington, of Cambridge, June\r\n21, 1718. It is claimed that he was descended from Sir Martin Bowes,\r\nLord Mayor of London. Nicholas Bowes, son of the preceding was born at\r\nBoston, Nov. 2nd, 1706. He graduated at Harvard College as M. A., was\r\nminister at Bedford from 1730 to 1754. He married Lucy Hancock, the aunt\r\nof John Hancock, the Revolutionary Governor of Massachusetts. Their son\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BOWES, was born at Boston, 3 December 1734. He married Ann\r\nWhitney, March 22, 1761, who died Jan. 2, 1762. His second wife was Mary\r\nStoddard, whom he married Oct. 30, 1769, and who died 9 May, 1774. He\r\nwas a merchant and had inherited in 1764 a large property from his\r\nuncle, Thomas Hancock, one of the wealthiest merchants in Boston. He was\r\nan Addresser of Governor Hutchinson in 1774, and of General Gage in\r\n1775. At the evacuation of Boston he went to Halifax with his family of\r\nfour persons. In 1788 he was proscribed and banished, and his estates\r\nconfiscated. He died near London, April, 1805. His eldest son,\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BOWES, born at Boston, 15 Oct. 1771, lived in England and died\r\nnear London 10 June, 1850, aged 79. He married Harriet Troutbeck,\r\ndaughter of Rev.

He came to Roxbury, Massachusetts, in\r\n1637 and was freeman May 22, 1639. He married in Nazing, England, Mary\r\nCurtis. He died in Roxbury, November 16, 1644, and his wife died in\r\n1674, leaving four children.\r\n\r\nHis son Samuel was many years selectman, representative, and captain of\r\nthe Roxbury company. His son Samuel succeeded his father in the several\r\noffices named and in company with seven other persons purchased, Dec.\r\n27, 1686, for L20, from John Nagers and Lawrence Nassawano, two noted\r\nIndians, a tract of land containing by estimation 12 miles long north\r\nand south and eight miles wide east and west. This purchase is now known\r\nas the town of Hardwick, Mass. His son, the Rev. Timothy Ruggles, was\r\nborn in Roxbury, Massachusetts November 3., 1685, and married Mary\r\nWhite, the daughter of Benjamin and Susanna White. He graduated from\r\nHarvard College in 1707, and was ordained pastor of the Rochester church\r\nin 1710, which office he held until his death which occurred October 26,\r\n1768. He was a great worker in the community and much beloved.\r\n\r\nGENERAL TIMOTHY RUGGLES, born in Rochester, Mass., October 20, 1711,\r\neldest son of Rev. Timothy Ruggles, one of the fifth generation of\r\nRuggles in America, graduated at Harvard College in 1732 and commenced\r\npracticing law in Rochester. He represented his native town in the\r\nprovincial assembly at the age of 25, and procured the passing of a bill\r\nstill in force prohibiting sheriffs from filing writs. He removed to\r\nHarwich about 1753 on to the lands bought by his grandfather from the\r\nIndians. In 1757 he was appointed judge and in 1762 Chief Justice of the\r\nCourt of Common Pleas, which he held till the Revolution. He was also\r\nsurveyor-general of the king's forest, an office of profit, attended\r\nwith but little labor. Besides professional employment he was engaged in\r\nmilitary and political occupation.\r\n\r\nIn 1756 almost immediately before Mr. Ruggles' appointment to the\r\nbench, he accepted a Colonel's Commission in the forces raised by his\r\nnative province for service on the frontier of Canada. In the campaign\r\nwhich followed, he served under the command of Sir William Johnson, and\r\ndid good service in the expedition against Crown Point. In September of\r\nthe same year he was second in command under that leader at the battle\r\nof Lake George, in which the French under Baron Dieskau, met a signal\r\ndefeat, after very severe fighting, in which he distinguished himself\r\nfor coolness, courage and ability, and so highly were his services\r\nesteemed on that occasion that he was promoted to the position of General\r\nof Brigade and placed under the command of the Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\nIn 1758 he commanded the Third Division of the Provisional troops under\r\nAbercrombie, in the unsuccessful attack upon Ticonderoga. He also served\r\nwith distinction and courage in the campaign of 1759-1760. In the winter\r\nof 1762 while the belligerent forces on both sides were in winter\r\nquarters, he had the honor to be chosen speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives. On the passing of the Stamp Act in 1765 delegates were\r\nchosen by the legislature of the various colonies, to seek out some\r\nrelief from immediate and threatened evils, by a representation of their\r\ngrievances to the king and parliament. Gen. Ruggles was chosen as one of\r\nthe delegates from Massachusetts. The Stamp Act Congress met at New\r\nYork, Oct. 19, 1765, and General Ruggles was elected president of same.\r\nAn address to the king was voted and certain resolves framed setting\r\nforth the rights of the colonies, and claiming an entire exemption from\r\nall taxes, excepting those imposed by the local assemblies. Gen. Ruggles\r\nrefused his concurrence in the proceedings for which he was censured on\r\nhis return by the House of Representatives, and was reprimanded by the\r\nspeaker who occupied his place. John Adams, who claimed relationship\r\nwith Ruggles before his defection found nothing in his character but\r\nwhat was noble and grand. \"Ruggles' grandeur\" he wrote, \"consists in the\r\nquickness of his apprehension, steadiness of his attention, the boldness\r\nand strength of his thoughts and his expressions, his strict honor,\r\nconscious superiority, contempt of meanness, etc.\" He was, he said, a\r\nman of genius and great resolution. At an early period of the Disunion\r\npropaganda. Ruggles, conceiving that the course of the British\r\nGovernment was neither politic nor just, and believing that the Disunion\r\nleaders honestly intended to bring about a reform, joined hands with\r\nthem and as previously stated he was elected President of the Stamp Act\r\nCongress, but on the discovery of the real aim of that body, he refused\r\nto proceed any further on the road to Disunion and left the Congress.\r\nAdams then suddenly discovered, \"an inflexible oddity about him, which\r\nhas gained him a character for courage and probity, and that at\r\nCongress.\" \"His behavior was very dishonorable\" and governed by\r\n\"pretended scruples and timidities\" and ever since he was \"held in utter\r\ncontempt and derision by the whole continent.\" But fifty years later,\r\nwhen no advantage could be gained by blackening the character of this\r\nbrave and honest man, he remembered he was a high-minded man, an\r\nexalted soul acting in scenes he could not comprehend.[176] General\r\nRuggles was a staunch, independent and fearless supporter of the\r\ngovernment, a son of Massachusetts of which she should be proud.\r\n\r\n  [176] Diary and Letters of John Adams.\r\n\r\nAn extract from the \"History of the County of Annapolis, Nova Scotia,\"\r\nsays, \"The conduct of Mr. Ruggles as a military commander has been\r\nhighly praised by most competent judges. Few men in the province were\r\nmore distinguished and few more severely dealt with in the bitter\r\ncontroversies preceding the Revolution. His appearance was commanding\r\nand dignified, being much above the common size; his wit was ready and\r\nbrilliant; his mind clear, comprehensive and penetrating; his judgment\r\nwas profound and his knowledge extensive; his abilities as a public\r\nspeaker placed him among the first of the day; and had he embraced the\r\npopular sentiments of the times, there is no doubt he would have ranked\r\namong the leading characters of the Revolution.\"\r\n\r\nBy pen and tongue, in the halls of the Legislature, and on the platform,\r\nhe declared against rebellion and bloodshed; General Ruggles was a good\r\nscholar and possessed powers of mind of a very high order. Many\r\nanecdotes continue to be related of him in the town of his nativity,\r\nwhich show his shrewdness, his sagacity, his military hardihood and\r\nbravery. As a lawyer he was an impressive pleader and in parliamentary\r\ndebate able and ingenious. He remained in the army until 1760, the last\r\nthree years being Brigadier General under Lord Amherst.\r\n\r\nAs the Revolutionary quarrel progressed he became one of the most\r\nviolent supporters of the ministry and he and Otis as leaders of the two\r\nopposing parties were in constant collision in the discussion of the\r\npopular branch of government. In 1774 he was named a Mandamus\r\nCouncillor, which increased his unpopularity to so great a degree that\r\nhis house was attacked by night and his cattle were maimed and poisoned.\r\nGeneral Ruggles tried to form a plan of combining the Loyalists against\r\nthe Disunionists after the model of similar associations formed in other\r\ncolonies. On December 22, 1774, he sent a communication to the \"Printers\r\nof the Boston Newspaper\" concerning the forming of an Association \"and\r\nif attended to and complied with by the good people of the province\r\nmight put it in the power of anyone very easily to distinguish such\r\nloyal subjects to the king and are to assert their rights to freedom, in\r\nall respects consistent with the laws of the land from such rebellious\r\nones as under the pretence of being friends of liberty, are frequently\r\ncommitting the most enormous outrages upon the persons and the property\r\nof such of his Majesty's peaceable subjects who for want of knowing whom\r\nto call upon, in these distracted times for assistance, fall into the\r\nhands of bandits, whose cruelties surpass those of savages.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Association\" consisted of a preamble and six articles. The\r\nprincipal were the first and third, which provided \"That we will upon\r\nall occasions, with our lives and fortunes, stand by and assist each\r\nother in the defence of life, liberty and property, whenever the same\r\nshall be attacked or endangered by any bodies of men, riotously\r\nassembled upon any pretence, or under any authority not warranted by the\r\nlaws of the land.\" And \"That we will not acknowledge or submit to the\r\npretended authority of any Congress, Committees of Correspondence, or\r\nany other unconstitutional assembly of men, but will at the risk of our\r\nlives if need be, oppose the forcible exercise of all such authority.\"\r\n\r\nThe Association did not succeed, the Loyalists were not inclined to such\r\norganization, nor fitted for secret intrigue without which it could not\r\nhave succeeded in combatting the measures of the Disunionists. They were\r\nslow to join, and inefficient in action. No good was accomplished by\r\nthis association and the Disunionists proceeded on their way triumphant.\r\n\r\nWhen the appeal to arms had been finally decided on by the Disunionists,\r\nthe popular excitement was at a fearful height, and all those who had\r\ncounselled moderation, either in demand or action, were declared to be\r\nenemies to their country and traitors to the cause of liberty, and as\r\nsuch worthy of death. No man in Massachusetts was regarded as so\r\ninimical to the cause of rebellion as General Ruggles, whose known and\r\nrecognized ability, great energy, and unflinching courage made him an\r\nobject of fear as well as dislike.\r\n\r\nThey denounced him as malignant and openly threatened his life. In\r\nconsequence of this violence he was forced, with his family and such of\r\nhis neighbors as remained loyal, to seek safety and refuge from his\r\ndwelling house which he had built in Harwich by joining the British\r\nforces in Boston. On the very day of the battle of Lexington, a body of\r\nLoyalists formed in Boston, composed of tradesmen and merchants. They\r\nare spoken of as \"the gentlemen volunteers,\" or Loyal American\r\nAssociation. They were placed under the command of Brigadier General\r\nRuggles. During the siege of Boston they were joined by other Loyalist\r\ncompanies, Loyal Irish Volunteers, Captain James Forrest, Royal\r\nHonorable Americans, Colonel Gorham. After the evacuation of Boston he\r\nwas in Long Island for a while and in 1783 he was an exile from his\r\nnative province in his old age, but still as vigorous as he was loyal.\r\nHis extensive estates in Harwich were confiscated, but were made up to\r\nhim subsequently by the crown. He was living at Digby or Annapolis in\r\nthe year of 1783, and made an application for a grant of land in that\r\nportion of the province. \"In the following year the grant was issued.\r\nThe undismayed grantee commenced a labor at the age of more than seventy\r\nyears, which few, if any of the young men of to-day would voluntarily\r\nundertake. The work of chopping down the forests and clearing the lands\r\nfor crops and of preparation for building went on simultaneously and\r\nrapidly under his direction.\r\n\r\n\"Two young men, Stromach and Fales, were employed to work with him for a\r\nlimited number of years and receive their pay in land. They did their\r\nwork, and he paid them, and their descendants are now the occupiers of\r\nmany a fair home in the beautiful township of Wilmot.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Ruggles' four daughters were married before the Revolution\r\nbroke out and their husbands probably adhered to the Colonial side, for\r\nthey never came to Nova Scotia. Three of his sons followed him into\r\nexile and settled in that country, Timothy, John, and Richard. It may\r\nnot be without use to remark that for much the greater part of his life,\r\nGeneral Ruggles ate no animal food, and drank no spirituous or fermented\r\nliquors, small beer excepted, and that he enjoyed health to his advanced\r\nage. This remarkable leader of men died in 1795. The \"Royal Gazette\" in\r\nAugust, 1795, said of him that \"the district of county in which he lived\r\nwill long feel the benefits resulting from the liberal exertions he made\r\nto advance the agricultural interests of the Province.\" It was also said\r\nof General Timothy Ruggles that he was one of the best soldiers in the\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nHe was buried to the eastward of the chancel of the (then new) church,\r\nlately known as the \"Pine Grove Church,\" in Central Wilmot, near the\r\npresent village of Middleton,--a church toward the erection of which he\r\nwas a considerable contributor.\r\n\r\nNumerous descendants of General Ruggles are to be met with in Nova\r\nScotia. There is a street and church in Roxbury named after this\r\nillustrious family.\r\n\r\nJOHN RUGGLES, son of General Ruggles of Harwich, Mass., was proscribed\r\nand banished in 1778. He settled in Nova Scotia and died there in 1795.\r\nHis widow Hannah, only daughter of Dr. Thomas Sackett of New York, died\r\nat Wilmot, N. S. in 1839, aged 76. His only son, CAPTAIN TIMOTHY AMHERST\r\nRUGGLES of the Nova Scotia Fencibles died at the same place in 1838 at\r\nthe age of 56.\r\n\r\nTIMOTHY RUGGLES, another son of the General, was a member of the House\r\nof Assembly of Nova Scotia for many years. He died at N. S. in 1831.\r\nSarah, his widow, died at that place in 1842, aged 92.\r\n\r\nRICHARD RUGGLES, son of the General, was born at Rochester, Mass., in\r\n1774 and died at Annapolis in 1832.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE FANEUIL FAMILY OF BOSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Faneuils were Huguenot refugees from La Rochelle, France. When they\r\ncame to America they brought with them considerable wealth in jewels and\r\nmoney. From their coat of arms we should judge they dated back as far as\r\nthe crusades, as the crossed palm branches can have no other meaning.\r\n\r\nThere is a paper extant in the French language and written by Benjamin\r\nFaneuil the elder. It is a family record in which he states that in 1699\r\nhe married Ann Bureau; then follows the birth of Peter Faneuil,\r\nafterwards the birth of three daughters. This paper was left by Benjamin\r\nFaneuil the younger, and is now in the possession of his great-grand-son\r\nGeorge A. Bethune, M. D., Boston (1884). They first settled near New\r\nRochelle, N. Y., and in 1699 Benjamin Faneuil was given the freedom of\r\nthe city of New York. In Valentine's \"History of New York,\" P. 219, we\r\nread in a list of the principal merchants of the city the name of\r\nBenjamin Faneuil the third in the list.\r\n\r\nAndrew, the brother of Benjamin settled in Boston and made an immense\r\nfortune as a merchant. His wife was born in Holland and was a very\r\nbeautiful woman.\r\n\r\nAndrew Faneuil had no children that lived to maturity. He adopted two\r\nsons of his brother Benjamin of New York--Peter, born in 1701, and\r\nBenjamin the younger, born in 1702. Benjamin Faneuil the younger,\r\nmarried the daughter of Dr. John Cutler from a noted German family.\r\nAndrew Faneuil was offended about this marriage and left most of his\r\nfortune to his nephew Peter Faneuil. Peter Faneuil died five years after\r\nhis uncle and left no will, and his brother Benjamin was declared sole\r\nheir to his fortune.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Faneuil the elder is buried on the north side of Trinity church\r\nin New York City and the gravestone is in good preservation. His brother\r\nAndrew lived in a splendid house at the corner of Somerset and Beacon\r\nStreets, Boston; the house after his death was owned and occupied by\r\nGardner Greene. From that home in Boston Andrew Faneuil was buried,\r\nhaving a most imposing funeral. (See Memorial Hist. of Boston). His tomb\r\nis in the graveyard at the south side of the common.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Faneuil the younger, and Mary Cutler, had two sons neither of\r\nwhom left descendants, and a daughter. He lived at one time in Boston at\r\nthe corner of Washington and Summer Streets, and later in Brighton. He\r\nwas stone blind for twenty years and lived to be eighty-four years of\r\nage. He was an admirable character and greatly beloved. His daughter\r\nentertained General Washington at their home during the seige of Boston,\r\nand General Lee was with him. Benjamin Faneuil admired Washington and he\r\ntold him so, emphatically, whether a Whig or not. But he also told\r\nGeneral Lee who was an Englishman that he had his \"head in the noose\"\r\nfor he was a very decided old man and had to state his opinions under\r\nany circumstances.\r\n\r\nPeter Faneuil possessed his uncle's estate only about five years but\r\nduring that time he lived in sumptuous style at the corner of Somerset\r\nand Beacon Streets in the house that Andrew built. He gave great sums to\r\ncharity and Faneuil Hall was but one of his gifts to the city. Every\r\ncharity of that day has his name down for a large sum. To Trinity church\r\nhe gave a L100 for an organ and a donation to support the families of\r\nthe deceased clergy of that church. It became so large that it was\r\ndivided between Trinity church and Kings Chapel, and has done much good.\r\nThere is a fine portrait of Peter Faneuil still extant; it was given to\r\nthe Antiquarian Society of Boston by his niece, Miss Jones, and is a\r\nbetter picture than the one in Faneuil Hall.\r\n\r\nPeter Faneuil was a careful business man, but was always generous. At\r\nthe time of the erection of Faneuil Hall there was no market house then\r\nin the town, and so he erected a building one hundred feet in length by\r\nforty feet in width. Besides the market there were several rooms for\r\ntown officers, and a hall which would contain one thousand persons. On\r\nthe completion of the building the first public oration held there was a\r\nfuneral eulogy delivered in honor of its donor, Peter Faneuil, March 14,\r\n1743 by Master Lovell of the Latin School, and was \"Recorded by Order of\r\nTown.\"[177] The Hall was dedicated to Liberty and Loyalty to the King in\r\nthe following words, \"May Liberty always spread its Joyful Wings, over\r\nthis Place. And may Loyalty to a King under whom we enjoy this Liberty\r\never remain our Character.\" That the building should ever be used by\r\nconspirators against the King, and become synonymous for disloyalty to\r\nthe King, was the very last purpose that its founder intended it to be\r\nused for, yet by the strange irony of fate Faneuil Hall became known to\r\nthe world as the \"Cradle of Liberty\" in which the Revolution was rocked.\r\nThe town also voted to purchase the \"Arms of Peter Faneuil and Fix them\r\nup in Faneuil Hall.\" Only a few years passed when the very people he had\r\nso benefited by his bounty tore down his \"Arms\" and portraits, and\r\nshowed the most violent marks of disrespect to the memory of him who had\r\nbeen their best friend, but it was unreasonable violence that moved the\r\nmob who called themselves patriots. Faneuil Hall is a permanent memorial\r\nof the Huguenots of Boston and with the exception of a few crumbling\r\ngravestones it is the only visible monument of their residence here.\r\n\r\n  [177] See Boston Town Records 1742 to 1757. pp. 14, 15, 16. Printed by\r\n  the City of Boston.\r\n\r\nPeter Faneuil died in 1742 and left his vast fortune to his two nephews,\r\nPeter and Benjamin Faneuil the younger, the latter being an eminent\r\nmerchant and was one of the consignees of the tea that was destroyed by\r\nthe mob. The following letter sent to him by the \"patriots\" at that time\r\nundoubtedly expresses the feelings and the sentiment of those who formed\r\nthe \"Boston Tea Party.\" The letter he said was found in his entry.\r\n\r\n     \"Gentlemen, It is currently reported that you are in the extremest\r\n     anxiety respecting your standing with the good people of this Town\r\n     and Province, as commissioners of the sale of the monopolized and\r\n     dutied tea. We do not wonder in the least that your apprehensions\r\n     are terrible, when the most enlightened humans and conscientious\r\n     community on the earth view you in the light of tigers or mad dogs,\r\n     whom the public safety obliges them to destroy. Long have this\r\n     people been irreconcilable to the idea of spilling human blood, on\r\n     almost any occasion whatever, but they have lately seen a\r\n     penitential thief suffer death for pilfering a few pounds, from\r\n     scattering individuals you boldly avow a resolution to bear a\r\n     principal part in the robbing of every inhabitant of this country,\r\n     in the present and future ages of every thing dear and interesting\r\n     to them. Are there no laws in the Book of God and nature that\r\n     enjoin such miscreants to be cut off from among the people, as\r\n     troublers of the whole congregation. Yea, verily, there are laws\r\n     and officers to put them into execution, which you can neither\r\n     corrupt, intimidate, nor escape, and whose resolution to bring you\r\n     to condign punishment you can only avoid by a speedy imitation of\r\n     your brethren in Philadelphia. This people are still averse to\r\n     precipitate your fate, but in case of much longer delay in\r\n     complying with their indispensable demands, you will not fail to\r\n     meet the just rewards of your avarice and insolence. Remember,\r\n     gentlemen, this is the last warning you are ever to expect from the\r\n     insulted, abused and most indignant vindicators of violated liberty\r\n     in the Town of Boston.\r\n\r\n    Thursday evening 9 o'clock,\r\n      Nov. 4. 1773.

They counselled prudence until the\r\ncountry was prepared for action in a constitutional way. They were\r\nentirely opposed to mob violence, and their patriotism took a reasonable\r\npractical form, looking to the best interests of all. Further they had\r\nno angry feelings against the English; they had too recently been\r\nreceived and protected by them when their own country turned them out.\r\nThey always spoke of the English as a great nation. They admired their\r\nliberality as to religious opinions in which France was wanting.\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN FANEUIL the elder previously referred to, the father of Peter\r\nand Benjamin, the younger, and Mary died at Cambridge in 1785 aged 84.\r\n\r\nPETER FANEUIL his son, who shared with his brother the vast fortune left\r\nthem by their uncle went to Canada at the outbreak of the Revolution and\r\nthen to the West Indies.\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN FANEUIL found that it was necessary for his safety to leave\r\nBoston. He went to Halifax with the fleet when Boston was invaded on\r\nMarch 17, 1776, he afterwards went to England where he had $300,000 in\r\nEnglish funds, with which he entertained his friends, the less fortunate\r\nrefugees. In writing to a friend he said, \"When we shall be able to\r\nreturn to Boston I cannot say, but hope and believe it will not exceed\r\none year, for sooner or later America will be conquered, that you may\r\ndepend on.\" He, however, was destined never to return but was proscribed\r\nand banished. He resided at Bristol where he died in 1785. His wife Jane\r\nwas the daughter of Addington Davenport. The Faneuil name has become\r\nextinct; there are, however, numerous descendants through the female.\r\nMary Faneuil, daughter of Benjamin Faneuil the elder became the wife of\r\nGeorge Bethune, Oct. 13, 1754, and died in 1797, leaving many\r\ndescendants. Mary Ann Faneuil, sister of Peter, who built the hall,\r\nmarried John Jones, who died at Roxbury in 1767, and whose son Edward\r\ndied in Boston in 1835 at the age of 83. She was a loyalist, and resided\r\nfor some time in Windsor, Nova Scotia. A letter from her son dated at\r\nBoston, June 23, 1783, advising her if desirous of returning, not to\r\ncome directly to Boston, as the law was still in force; but first to\r\nsome other State and thence to Boston.[179]\r\n\r\n  [179] Dealings with the Dead, p. 510.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE COFFIN FAMILY OF BOSTON.\r\n\r\n  ADMIRAL SIR ISAAC COFFIN, SIR THOMAS ASTON COFFIN, ADMIRAL\r\n            FROMAN H. COFFIN, GENERAL JOHN COFFIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of Coffin is widely spread over this continent; thousands take\r\npride in tracing their descent from Tristram Coffin of Alwington, which\r\nextends along the Severn Sea, south of the boundary between Somerset and\r\nDevon, fronting the broad Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe Coffins came over with William the Conqueror and settled there in\r\n1066. It is said that the name Coffin was a corruption or translation of\r\nColvinus, signifying a basket or chest, and that from the charge of the\r\nKing's treasure, such employment, like royalty itself, being hereditary,\r\nthe name became attached to the family. In 1085, according to the\r\n\"Doomsday Book,\" Alwington was possessed by David De la Bere, and that\r\nthe heiress of that name brought it to the Coffins. On a subject less\r\ngrave this might be suspected for a jest but the authority is proof.\r\nTristram came over to New England in 1642 and settled at Salisbury, and\r\nalso at Haverhill and Newbury. He resided at these places for sixteen\r\nyears and then went to Nantucket, which at that time was a dependency of\r\nNew York. For 80 pounds he and his associates bought of the Indians a\r\nlarge part of the island. Tristram's third son, James, was Judge of the\r\nCourt of Common Pleas and of Probate. James' son, Nathaniel, married the\r\ndaughter of William Gayer, and niece of Sir John Gayer. William, the\r\neldest son of Nathaniel, born 1699, removed to Boston and became\r\nproprietor of the Lunch of Grapes Tavern in 1731. It was situated on\r\nKing street at the corner of Mackerel lane, the site now occupied by the\r\nExchange building, on the corner of State and Kilby streets. It was a\r\ntavern from 1640 to 1760, when the Great Fire swept everything away.\r\n\r\nThe Coffins were strong in numbers and near neighbors, along the\r\nprincipal thoroughfare, now Washington street, dwelt twenty families,\r\ndescended from William Coffin, or their near kinfolk, who lived in\r\nconstant intercourse. The patriarch, at four score, his vigor hardly\r\nabated, lived on this street near his son's house. His daughter,\r\nElizabeth, married her cousin, Thomas C. Amory, who had bought the house\r\nopposite her father's, at the corner of Hollis street, built by Governor\r\nBelcher for his own use. He was one of the organizers of Trinity church\r\nin 1734 and was one of the first wardens of same. He lived in honor and\r\naffluence till he died in 1774, just before the war broke out, which\r\nsaved him from witnessing the exile and widespread confiscation that\r\nawaited his sons. His children and their children counted about sixty\r\nwhen he died, but of his descendants bearing the name of Coffin, all\r\nhave died out in Massachusetts. He had four sons, all staunch Loyalists,\r\nWilliam, Nathaniel, John and Ebenezer. The daughters, Mrs. De Blois,\r\nMrs. Amory, and Mrs. Dexter, married into the best families of Boston,\r\nand through love for their husbands took the other side. The sons were\r\nproscribed and banished by an Act of the Massachusetts Legislature.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM COFFIN, JR., the eldest son of William, was born in Boston,\r\nApril 11th, 1723. He was an Addresser of General Gage, was proscribed\r\nand banished. He accompanied the Royal Army to Halifax in 1776 on the\r\nevacuation of Boston.\r\n\r\nSIR THOMAS ASTON COFFIN, Baronet, son of William, Jr., was born at\r\nBoston, March 31, 1754. He graduated at Harvard College in 1772. He was\r\nfor a long time Secretary to Sir Guy Carleton, by whose side he sat in\r\nthe last boat which left Castle Garden on the evacuation of New York,\r\n25th Nov., 1783. When Sir Guy Carleton became Lord Dorchester and\r\nGovernor of Quebec, 1784, Coffin accompanied him and by his influence\r\nwas appointed in 1804 Secretary and Comptroller of Accounts of Lower\r\nCanada. At another part of his life he was Commissary General in the\r\nBritish Army. He went to England and died in London in 1810, very\r\nwealthy. He was grandfather to Mrs. Bolton, wife of Col. Bolton, R. A.,\r\nwho took an active part in the Red River Expedition of 1870.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM COFFIN, the second son of William Coffin, Jr., was born in\r\nBoston, 1758, and died at Kingston, Canada, in 1804.\r\n\r\nEBENEZER COFFIN, the third son of William Coffin, Jr., was born at\r\nBoston, 1763, went to South Carolina where he acquired property as a\r\nmerchant and planter and was the father of Thomas Aston Coffin of\r\nCharleston, South Carolina, whose descendants, with an hereditary\r\ninstinct, distinguished themselves by their chivalrous devotion to a\r\nfailing cause in the late Confederate war.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL COFFIN, second eldest son of William, was born in Boston in\r\n1725, graduated at Harvard College in 1744, received in 1750 an honorary\r\ndegree at Yale. Brought up a merchant, he was early appointed King's\r\nCashier of the Customs and acquired considerable property. He resided on\r\nthe corner of Essex and Rainsford Lane, now Harrison avenue. The tide\r\nwashed up to the garden wall. Near by in front, on what is now called\r\nWashington street, was the \"Liberty Tree,\" where Captain Mackintosh and\r\nhis \"chickens,\" met to plan outrages upon loyal citizens.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1767, a flagstaff was erected which went through and above it\r\nhighest branches. A flag hoisted on this was the notice for the\r\nassembling of the \"Sons of Liberty\" for action. In 1775, his son\r\nNathaniel, and his friends cut it down, much to the disgust of\r\nMackintosh who was known as the \"First Captain General of Liberty Tree.\"\r\nOn the building occupying its site is a stone bas-relief of the tree\r\nwith an inscription on it. Nathaniel Coffin held one of the most\r\nlucrative positions under the crown, his acquaintances and friends were\r\nnaturally among the government officials and the better class of the\r\ncommunity. He had much to lose if he severed from his fealty to the\r\nmother country and, banishment and confiscation would be the penalty, if\r\nthe disunionists succeeded.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL COFFIN was the last Receiver General and Cashier of his\r\nMajesty's Customs at the Port of Boston, he was an addressor of\r\nHutchinson in 1774 and of Gage in 1775. With his family of three persons\r\nhe accompanied the Royal Army to Halifax in 1776 and in July of that\r\nyear embarked for England in the ship Aston Hall. In May, 1780, while\r\nreturning, he died the day before the vessel arrived at New York. His\r\nwife was Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Barnes of Boston.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL COFFIN, JR., son of the aforesaid, was born in Boston in 1749.\r\nWas an Addresser of Hutchinson in 1774 and a Protester against the\r\ndisunionists the same year. He was brought up to the bar, and succeeded\r\nwell in his profession. As he took a prominent part on the side of the\r\nGovernment; and caused the \"Liberty Tree\" to be cut down, he was obliged\r\nto fly, or he would have been tarred and feathered. He employed a negro\r\nto assist him in cutting it down. A thousand dollars reward was offered\r\nby the Revolutionists for the offender, the darky informed against him,\r\nand he had to leave.[180] He was at New York in 1783, and was one of the\r\npetitioners for lands in Nova Scotia. At a subsequent period he was\r\nappointed Collector of Customs at the island of St. Kitt's and filled\r\nthat position for thirty-four years. He died in London in 1831, aged 83.\r\n\r\n  [180] \"Memoir of General John Coffin.\" By Captain Henry Coffin. R. N.,\r\n  1880, p. 17.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM COFFIN, second son of Nathaniel, the Cashier. An Addresser of\r\nHutchinson in 1774; went to Halifax in 1776, proscribed and banished,\r\n1778. Assisted his brother in destroying the \"Liberty Tree.\" He had\r\nthree sons in the British service. After the peace, he was at St. John,\r\nNew Brunswick, a prosperous merchant.\r\n\r\nGENERAL JOHN COFFIN, the third son of Nathaniel, the Cashier, was born\r\nin Boston, 1756, was sent to sea at a very early age, and at the age of\r\neighteen was in command of a ship. In 1775, while his ship was in\r\nEngland, she was engaged by the government to take troops to America. He\r\nhad on board nearly a whole regiment with General Howe in command of the\r\ntroops, who was ordered out to supersede General Gage at Boston. The\r\nvessel arrived at Boston June 15th. Mr. Coffin landed the regiment on\r\nJune 17th at Bunker Hill, and the action having already commenced, he\r\nwas requested by the Colonel, \"to come up and see the fun,\" the only\r\nweapon at hand being the tiller of his boat; he immediately, to use a\r\nnautical phrase, \"unshipped it,\" and with equal determination, commenced\r\n\"laying about\" him, and \"shipped\" the musket, powder and belt of the\r\nfirst man he knocked down. He bore an active part and distinguished\r\nhimself during the rest of the action. In consideration of his gallant\r\nconduct he was presented to General Gage after the battle and made an\r\nensign on the field, shortly after he was promoted to a lieutenancy,\r\nbut still retained the command of his ship. He was promised by General\r\nHowe on his arrival at Boston the command of 400 men, if he would go to\r\nNew York and raise them. He accordingly went to New York when Boston was\r\nevacuated March 17, 1776, where he raised among the Loyalists a mounted\r\nrifle corps, called the \"Orange Rangers,\" of which he was made\r\nCommandant, and from which he exchanged into the New York Volunteers in\r\n1778. He took part in the defeat of Washington in the battle of Long\r\nIsland in 1777 and went with that corps to Georgia in 1778. Here he\r\nraided a corps of partisan cavalry, composed chiefly of loyal planters.\r\nAt the battle of Savannah, at that of Hobkerk's Hill, and the action of\r\nCross Creek near Charleston, and on various other occasions, his conduct\r\nwon the admiration of his superior.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Eutaw Springs which he opened on the part of the King's\r\ntroops, his gallantry and good judgment attracted the notice and remark\r\nof General Greene, the Revolutionary leader, one of General Washington's\r\nablest lieutenants. Major Coffin with 150 infantry and 50 cavalry\r\naverted the advance on Eutaw. Colonel William Washington, a\r\ndistinguished partisan leader, with numerous cavalry rashly dashed\r\nforward; he lost most of his officers and many of his men, and his horse\r\nwas shot under him, and he would have been slain had not Major Coffin\r\ninterposed, who took him prisoner. These two men, who had known each\r\nother well in private life, rode back to camp to share the same meal and\r\nthe same tent.\r\n\r\nIn the Southern colonies the Revolutionists and Loyalists, waged a war\r\nof extermination, the partisans on both sides, seldom gave quarter or\r\ntook prisoners. At the close of the conflict in Virginia Lord Cornwallis\r\nmade him a gift of a handsome sword, accompanied by a letter conferring\r\non him the rank of Major Brevet. Whilst Coffin was attached to\r\nCornwallis, he was able to be of great service to him, but the bravery,\r\nnot to say the extraordinary sagacity mingled with audacity of one man,\r\ncould not save the army. Lord Cornwallis' army cooped up in Yorktown by\r\na superior army of French and Americans, and blockaded by a French\r\nfleet, was in danger of starvation, and Coffin stood almost alone in\r\nsuccessful forays, in which he frequently eluded the whole American and\r\nFrench army, and returned laden with the fruits of his success. In one\r\nof these raids he accidentally came to the house of a wealthy planter\r\nwhose daughter was to be married that day. He quietly surrounded the\r\nhouse with his troops and knocking at the door, sent in word that he\r\nwished to speak with the proprietor. On presenting himself, the\r\ngentleman was courteously made aware of his condition. He was told not\r\nto make any noise, but to order sufficient turkeys, ham, wine and other\r\nprovisions to be put up, to satisfy his men; if this was done no harm\r\nwould happen, but on the contrary, if any resistance was attempted,\r\neverything and everybody in the house would be destroyed. Coffin's\r\ncharacter and resolution were well known, so the planter thought it best\r\nto graciously comply with the mandate. A large quantity of provisions\r\nwas thus secured.\r\n\r\nCaptain Coffin supped with the wedding party, danced with the bride, and\r\nleft in safety, taking care that no alarm should be given, and reached\r\nCornwallis without accident by daylight.\r\n\r\nEven when the enemy held Charleston, during which time he ran very great\r\nrisks of being taken prisoner, he went to see Miss Ann Matthews,\r\ndaughter of William Matthews, Esq., of St. John's Island, to whom he was\r\neventually married in 1781. On the occasion of one visit, the house was\r\nsearched for him by authority, and the gallant soldier took refuge under\r\nMiss Matthews' ample dress. At that time ladies wore hoops and they must\r\nhave been of considerable size, when Major Coffin, who stood six feet\r\ntwo and was proportionately stout, could successfully conceal himself\r\nunder one. At the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown, that portion of\r\nhis army consisting of native Americans, he failed to obtain special\r\nterms for, in the articles of capitulation. He, however, availed himself\r\nof the conceded privilege of sending an armed ship northerly, without\r\nmolestation, to convey away the most obnoxious of them. Major Coffin\r\ndetermined not to be taken by the Revolutionists who had offered $10,000\r\nfor his head, so he cut his way through the lines, and reached\r\nCharleston, attracted by the charms of Miss Matthews. When Charleston\r\nwas evacuated Major Coffin made his way up to New York, crossed the\r\nHudson, having eluded all attempts at his capture and presented himself\r\nat headquarters, to the great astonishment of his friends in the British\r\nArmy. Sir Guy Carleton, Commander-in-chief, appointed him Major of the\r\nKing's American Regiment, vacant by the death of Major Grant.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the evacuation of New York, and probably in view of it,\r\nMajor Coffin and others who were feared and disliked by the victorious\r\nRevolutionists, and were, therefore, thrust out beyond the pale of\r\nredemption, were sent by the British Government, to New Brunswick. At\r\ntwenty-seven he laid down his sword and took up his axe, accompanied by\r\na wife delicately nurtured in a wealthy family and a warm climate, and\r\nfour negroes, one woman and three men, all brought from Charleston. They\r\narrived in October, 1783, when there were but two persons in or near the\r\nharbor of St. John. Mr. Symonds and Mr. White, fur-traders, kindly\r\nsupplied the newcomers with provisions, and they immediately commenced\r\nclearing and felling timber. During the first winter they suffered great\r\nhardships, particularly Mrs. Coffin. His first mishap was the loss of\r\nhis boots in crossing a swamp, now the market place of the city of St.\r\nJohn. Having selected some lots of ground fronting the harbor, he\r\nproceeded to explore the interior of the country. An ascent of about\r\ntwelve miles up the beautiful St. John, opened out a rich and lovely\r\nlandscape-hill and dale, magnificent woods, rivers and lakes, swarming\r\nwith game and fish.\r\n\r\nIn this fine and fertile locality Major Coffin purchased for a trifle a\r\ntract of land from Colonel Grazier, to whom it had been granted by\r\nGovernment. Four men were sent up there to build a house, and in the\r\nfollowing May, 1784, he and his wife and four black servants, took\r\npossession of their new residence, and called it Alwington Manor, after\r\nthe family estate in Devonshire, which belonged to them in the time of\r\nWilliam the Conqueror. Two of the men, and the woman, proved to be good\r\nand faithful servants, and when the slaves were emancipated, still\r\nremained with the family.\r\n\r\nSettlers soon flocked into the province. Ten years' residence, with\r\nMajor Coffin's activity, aided by his willing men, made it a respectable\r\nand desirable settlement. He was made a Magistrate of the county and in\r\ndue time a Member of the Provincial Parliament, and of the Legislative\r\nCouncil, which offices he filled till within a few years of his death.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1794, His Royal Highness, the Duke of Kent, the father of Queen\r\nVictoria, who was then Governor of Nova Scotia, stopped at Alwington\r\nManor.\r\n\r\nAlthough retired from active employ, he still remained in the service on\r\nhalf pay, and in 1804 he was advanced to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.\r\nIn 1805 he went to England, where he was received with much distinction,\r\nand was presented to the King by the commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nThe war of 1812 aroused all the warlike instincts of the old partisan;\r\nhe snuffed the battle afar off, and at once offered to raise a regiment\r\nfor home service. He soon had 600 men ready for service, which enabled\r\nthe Government to send the 104th regiment to Canada, then hardly pressed\r\nby invasion. At the peace of 1815 he was promoted to the rank of\r\nMajor-General, and the regiment disbanded and General Coffin returned to\r\nhalf pay once more.\r\n\r\nHe for many years alternated in his residence between England and New\r\nBrunswick. He was the oldest General in the British Army when he died in\r\n1838, aged 82, at the house of his son, Admiral T. Coffin, in King's\r\nCounty, New Brunswick.\r\n\r\nThose who knew the General well in his later days, recall with\r\naffectionate recollection the noble presence and generous character of\r\nthe chivalrous old soldier, a relic of the days in which giants were in\r\nstature and in heart, true to his king and country, a humble Christian\r\nand an honest and brave man, who united to the heroism of a Paladin the\r\nendurance of the pioneer, and when he could no longer serve his Prince\r\nin the field, served him still better by creating a new realm of\r\ncivilization and progress in the heart of primeval forest. His name will\r\never be held in honor in New Brunswick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADMIRAL SIR ISAAC COFFIN.\r\n\r\nBorn in Boston, 1759. Died in England, June 23, 1839. From a painting in\r\npossession of the Boston Atheneum.]\r\n\r\nEight of the children of General and Mrs. Coffin, all natives of New\r\nBrunswick, lived to make their way in the world, thanks to a grateful\r\ngovernment and helpful country. The eldest son, General Guy Carleton\r\nCoffin, died in 1856, a General of the Royal Artillery; John Townsend\r\nCoffin, the second eldest, entered the British Navy as midshipman in\r\n1799 and became admiral in 1841. Under the will of his uncle, Sir Isaac\r\nCoffin, he became the owner of the Magdalen Islands in the Gulf of St.\r\nLawrence. He died in 1882. Henry Edward Coffin, the third son, became a\r\nlieutenant in the British Navy in 1814 and an Admiral in 1856. He\r\ndied in 1881. The eldest daughter, Caroline, married the Hon. Charles\r\nGrant of Canada, afterwards Baron de Longueuil; their son, the present\r\nBaron, married a daughter of Lewis Trapmane of Charleston, S. C. The\r\nsecond daughter married General Sir Thomas Pearson, K. C. B., an officer\r\nmuch distinguished in Canada during the war of 1812.\r\n\r\nA third married Colonel Kirkwood of the British Army and went to live in\r\nBath, England.\r\n\r\nA fourth married John Barnett, Esq., also an officer in the British\r\nArmy, who subsequently occupied a high official position in the Island\r\nof Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThe fifth, Mary, married Charles R. Ogden, Esq., Attorney-General, Lower\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nADMIRAL SIR ISAAC COFFIN was the fourth son of Nathaniel, the Cashier.\r\nHe was born in Boston in 1759. At eight years of age he entered the\r\nBoston Latin School. He was a diligent student in a class that embraced\r\nnumerous celebrities and when in Parliament he acknowledged himself\r\nindebted to the methods and discipline of the Boston schools for his apt\r\nclassical quotations, then a mode much in vogue in that august\r\nassemblage. His constitution was, however, too vigorous, his animal\r\nspirits too buoyant for scholarship alone to mark his schoolboy days. He\r\nled the sports of the playground and was the leader on the 5th of\r\nNovember, the anniversary of the Gunpowder plot. Boston was a pleasant\r\nplace to dwell in, broad stretches of tree or turf, sloping pastures,\r\nand blooming gardens, surrounded the abodes of the wealthy. Tide water\r\nfresh from the ocean, spread nearly around the peninsular. Beyond these\r\nbasins, wooded heights of considerable elevation lifted themselves above\r\nboundless tree tops. For fishing, or shooting, rowing, sailing, or\r\nswimming, coasting or skating, Boston with its environs of lake, and\r\norchard, was then the paradise for boys. It was a capital school for his\r\nplay hours, and the old Latin,--the oldest school in the\r\ncountry,--dating from 1635, for his studies of a graver sort. There\r\nfifteen of his cousins were his school mates, a host of his own\r\ncelebrities and four--Scheaffe, Moreland, Mackay, and Ochterlony--who\r\nbecame baronets, or generals by military service in England, he was well\r\nplaced for development nor were his opportunities neglected. At the\r\ncommencement of the Revolution Isaac was too young to enter into it, or\r\nto realize what it meant, but long before he entered, at the age of\r\nfourteen, the British navy, he no doubt had formed opinions of his\r\nown.[181] It was doubtless of advantage to him, quickening his faculties\r\nand maturing his character, that such events were transpiring about him\r\nat this plastic period. His sense of justice and right and of what\r\nfreedom signified, proved in his subsequent career that these advantages\r\nhad not been without effect.\r\n\r\n  [181] It is a singular fact that all persons of American birth that were\r\n  in the navy remained loyal. Washington came very near entering the navy\r\n  as midshipman and going with his brother Lawrence under Admiral Vernon\r\n  to the attack on Cartagena. His trunk was packed and he was all ready to\r\n  depart when his mother prevailed upon him to remain. Had he gone he\r\n  would have remained loyal, or his case would have been the exception.\r\n\r\nAt the age of fourteen Isaac entered the Royal navy under the auspices\r\nof Rear Admiral Montague. By him he was confided to the care of\r\nLieutenant William Hunter, at that time commanding the Brig Gaspee and\r\nwho then spoke of his pupil, \"Of all the young men I ever had the care\r\nof, none answered my expectations equal to Isaac Coffin. He pleased me\r\nso much that I took all the pains in my power to make him a good seaman,\r\nand I succeeded to the height of my wishes, for never did I know a young\r\nman acquire so much nautical knowledge in so short a time.\" After\r\nserving on the Gaspee he served as midshipman on the Kingfisher,\r\nCaptain, Diligent, Fowey, Le Pincon and the Sybl, frigate. In 1779\r\nCoffin, now Lieutenant, went to England and joined the Adamant. His next\r\nappointment was to the London of 98 guns, the flagship of Rear Admiral\r\nGraves on the coast of America, from her he removed into the Royal Oak\r\nwhere he acted as signal lieutenant in the action off Cape Henry, March\r\n16, 1781. By following such traces the naval histories of Great Britain\r\nafford of these several ships, we can reasonably conjecture the part\r\nCoffin took in the Revolutionary War. We learn what duties were\r\nperformed by him on each of them, and we have no reason to doubt, from\r\nhis rapid promotions, of his efficiency and zeal. We know that his\r\npatron, Admiral Montague, protected the rear of Howe's retreat from\r\nBoston in 1776, that the ships were often engaged with the enemy, and\r\nthat they captured several valuable prizes in which action he\r\nparticipated. The events of the first four years of the war from 1775 to\r\n1779 are sufficiently familiar. D'Estraing's repulse at Savannah and\r\nPrescott's evacuation of Newport in 1779, its reoccupation by Tiernay in\r\nJuly 1780. The reduction of Charleston, defeat of Gates at Camden.\r\nCapture at sea of Henry Laurens, president of Congress. After the\r\nsurrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown to the combined French and American\r\narmies and French fleet, De Grasse hastened to the West Indies intending\r\nto join the Spaniards, and capture Jamaica and drive the English out of\r\nthe West Indies. After the battle of March 16 at Cape Henry, on the\r\nreturn to New York, the Royal Oak took several valuable prizes, and then\r\nwent to Halifax for repairs. In the middle of June a vessel arrived from\r\nBristol with the remains of his father, who died the day before. Having\r\nheld an important government position, his obsequies in New York on\r\nBroadway showed due regard to his memory. Isaac was placed soon after in\r\ncommand of Avenger, the advanced post of the British up the North River,\r\nwhich he held during the autumn till he exchanged with Sir Alexander\r\nCochrane, for the Pocahontas and joined Admiral Hood at Barbados and\r\nserved on his flagship, the Barfleur. Soon after Coffin joined him he\r\nlearned that De Grasse was at St. Kitts, after an engagement there in\r\nwhich the French lost one thousand men, Hood joined Lord Rodney's fleet.\r\n\r\nFor two days the hostile fleets manoeuvered in sight of each other near\r\nDominica. In number the fleets were equal, in size and complement of\r\ncrew the French were immensely superior; they had twenty thousand\r\nsoldiers on board to be used in the conquest of Jamaica; a defeat at\r\nthis time would be England's ruin. The English Admiral was aware that\r\nhis country's fate was in his hands. It was one of those supreme moments\r\nwhich great men dare to use and weak ones tremble at. At seven in the\r\nmorning, April 12, 1782, the signal to engage was flying at the masthead\r\nof the Formidable Rodney's flagship. The Admiral lead in person and in\r\npassing through the enemy's line engaged the Glorieux, a 74, at close\r\nrange. He shot away her masts and bowsprit and left her a bare hull. All\r\nday long the cannons roared and one by one the French ships struck their\r\nflags or fought till they sank. The carnage on them was terrible,\r\ncrowded as they were with troops. Fourteen thousand were reckoned as\r\nkilled besides the prisoners. The Barfleur, Hood's flagship, on which\r\nwas Coffin engaged the \"Ville de Paris,\" the flagship of the French\r\nAdmiral, the pride of France, and the largest ship in the world. After\r\nfighting valiantly all day, after all hope was gone, and a broadside\r\nfrom the Barfleur had killed sixty men, she surrendered. Her decks above\r\nand below were littered over with mangled limbs and bodies. It was said\r\nwhen she struck there were but three men on the upper deck unhurt, the\r\nCount was one. The French fleet was totally destroyed, and on that\r\nmemorable day Yorktown was avenged, and the British empire was saved.\r\nPeace followed but it was peace with honor. The American Colonies were\r\nlost but England kept her West Indies. The hostile strength of Europe\r\nall combined had failed to wrest Britannia's ocean sceptre from her. She\r\nsat down, maimed and bleeding, but the wreath had not been torn from her\r\nbrows. She was and is still the sovereign of the seas. After the battle\r\nCaptain Coffin went in his sloop to Jamaica, where through the influence\r\nof Hood, he was appointed by Lord Rodney captain of the Shrewsbury, of\r\n74 guns; he was then only 22 years of age. This indicated the estimate\r\nof both Hood and Rodney of the value of his services in the late famous\r\nbattle. Peace soon came, but there was much to discourage him. His\r\nfamily was broken up. The remains of his father lay in their last\r\nresting place in New York. The Shrewsbury was paid off, and he was put\r\nout of commission. He was his own master with abundance of prize money.\r\nMany of his family and friends from Boston had taken up their abode in\r\nLondon, and the refugee loyalists formed there a large circle. They all\r\nliked Isaac, a handsome young fellow with pleasant ways, generous and\r\nunpretending and loaded with laurels. He was held in high estimation by\r\nthe great naval celebrities and by the public, their attention might\r\nhave turned the head of one less sensible.\r\n\r\nSir Guy Carleton, who had been created Lord Dorchester, could hardly\r\nhave saved Canada for the Crown in 1775 without the aid of the Coffins,\r\nwas now appointed Governor of Canada. It was probably at his request\r\nthat Isaac was appointed to the command of the Thisbe, to take him and\r\nhis family and suite to Quebec in 1786. While on his way up the river\r\nto Quebec the Thisbe was becalmed off the Magdalen Islands, and struck\r\nby their appearance, perhaps the more attractive from the autumnal\r\nsplendor, Coffin requested, probably not in very serious earnest, that\r\nLord Dorchester as representative of the Crown, would bestow them on\r\nhim. This request seemed reasonable to the governor, and eventually\r\nletters patent were granted to him on the Islands. The records recite\r\nthe grant of the islands to him for his zeal and unremitting persevering\r\nefforts in the public service. At Sir Isaac's death he left the island\r\nby will to his nephew, Admiral John T. Coffin, who died in 1882. On his\r\nreturn to Europe he was employed in many branches of the service. In\r\n1794 he was in charge of the Melampus frigate, in 1796 he was resident\r\ncommissioner of Corsica. From Elba he removed to Lisbon, to take charge\r\nof the naval establishment there for the next two years. He was then\r\ndispatched to superintend the arsenal at Port Mahon when Minorca fell\r\ninto the hands of the British, and from there to Nova Scotia, in the\r\nVenus frigate. At Halifax and afterwards at Sheerness, as resident\r\ncommissioner, he was employed till April 1804, when appointed rear\r\nadmiral he hoisted his flag on the Gladiator, and the following month\r\nwas created a baronet.\r\n\r\nMarch, 1811, he married Elizabeth Browne, but within a few years\r\nsatisfied of their utter incompatibility, they very amicably, on both\r\nsides, arranged for independence of each other. She was said to be\r\naddicted to writing sermons at night to the disturbance of the slumber\r\nof her rollicking spouse. The fault was certainly not hers, for she was\r\na clever and exemplary woman. She lived nearly as long as he did, but\r\nthey rarely met, though he made repeated overtures to reconciliation,\r\nsome rather amusing. It is the reasonable ambition of all Englishmen,\r\nwhose conditions and circumstances justify such aspirations, to be\r\npermitted to take part in the legislation and government of the country,\r\nand when Sir Isaac's health and peace rendered active service in the\r\nnavy no longer desirable, his wish was gratified by his return to\r\nParliament in 1818 for the borough of Ilchester for which he sat till\r\n1826. His reputation and experience, gave considerable weight to his\r\nopinion when he took part as he frequently did in debates on naval\r\naffairs. He was tall, robust, but of symmetrical proportions, his voice\r\npowerful, and his countenance expressive and noble. Sir Isaac died at\r\nCheltenham in Gloucestershire, June 23, 1839, at the age of 80. Lady\r\nCoffin preceded him to the tomb on the 27th of January that year. His\r\nbrother, General John Coffin, died the year previous, June 12, 1838, in\r\nNew Brunswick. Sir Isaac made frequent visits to his native town, having\r\nmade more than thirty voyages to and from America. The many brilliant\r\ngentlemen of Boston in professional life, or among its merchant princes,\r\naffluent and convivial, were pleased to have him as their guest. Loyalty\r\nto the mother country died out slowly, and a Boston born boy, who had\r\nattained great distinction, whose kinsfolk had ample means for\r\nhospitality, had much attention paid him. His kinsman, Thomas C. Amory\r\nwrites, \"Often when at my father's, who resided in Park street, where\r\nnow is the Union Club house, the festal entertainments extended into the\r\nsmall hours, and those upon whom it devolved to sit up to receive the\r\nroisters, would gladly welcome from far off his shout of 'Home ahoy!'\r\nbreaking the silent watches of the night.\"\r\n\r\nHis prize money amounted to considerable. This he entrusted to his\r\ncousin Amory in Boston, and the income finally equalled the original\r\ndeposit.\r\n\r\nHe was very generous to his native land. Soon after the war ended he\r\nestablished a schoolship in Massachusetts waters, for mates and skippers\r\nto learn the art of navigation. The barge Clio which he purchased for\r\nthe purpose, was commanded by his kinsman, Captain Hector Coffin, who\r\nwas imprudent enough in 1826 to go up in her to Quebec with the American\r\nflag flying and act in a very indiscreet manner, and when his brother,\r\nGeneral John Coffin, of New Brunswick, urged him to abandon what gave\r\numbrage at home, he acquiesced in giving up what had cost him several\r\nthousand pounds. He also sent over to the land of his birth famous race\r\nhorses and cattle to improve the breed; also fish, rare fruit and\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nHe was warmly attached to Nantucket, where his ancestors and their\r\ndescendants had dwelt for many generations. He visited the place and\r\nbecame acquainted with his kinsfolk and in 1826 appropriated $12,000\r\nafterwards increased till now it is upwards of $60,000, as a fund for a\r\nschool for the instruction of the posterity of Tristram. This includes\r\nnearly every native born child of the island. The Duke of Clarence,\r\nWilliam the Fourth, who succeeded his brother George to the throne,\r\nthrough his long connection with the navy, attached to him the officers\r\nwho had grown old with him. It is said the King had Sir Isaac upon his\r\nlist as Earl of Magdalen and intended to make him Governor of Canada,\r\nand the only obstacle that prevented it was the attachment he had for\r\nthe land of his birth.\r\n\r\nThis memoir of a Boston boy, who by dint of his own native energy\r\nattained a title, and the highest rank in the British navy, and a\r\ngenerous benefactor, whose works still bear witness to the noble impulse\r\nthat prompted them, will ever be kindly remembered and cherished by his\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nJonathan Perry Coffin, Sir Isaac's youngest brother, born in Boston in\r\n1762, was a barrister of repute in London.\r\n\r\nJOHN COFFIN, the third son of William and Ann Coffin, was born in\r\nBoston, August 19, 1729, and was brother of Nathaniel, the Cashier, and\r\nuncle of General John, and Admiral, Sir Isaac Coffin. In the\r\nconfiscation Act he was described as distiller, and combined this\r\nbusiness, no doubt, with that of merchant and ship owner. Loyal to the\r\ncore, and knowing that he was a marked man, he resolved early in 1775,\r\nto place his family in safety. Embarking, therefore, his household\r\ngoods, his wife and eleven children, on board his own schooner, the\r\nNeptune, he brought them around safely to Quebec where on the 23d\r\nAugust, 1775, he bought from \"La Dame Veuve Lacroix\" a piece of land at\r\nthe _pres de ville_, well known during the siege which followed as the\r\n\"Potash.\" He went to work with characteristic energy to establish a\r\ndistillery, when his work was interrupted by that celebrated event. In\r\nthe autumn the Revolutionary forces under Arnold and a former British\r\nofficer, Montgomery, invaded the Province, and Quebec was invested. Late\r\nin the year John Coffin joined the Quebec enrolled British militia and\r\nthe building he had designed for a distillery, became a battery for the\r\ndefence of the approach from Wolfe's cove. The battery was armed with\r\nthe guns of a privateer frozen in for the winter. Her commander,\r\nBarnsfare, and his seamen handled the pieces, and by his side John\r\nCoffin, the Boston Loyalist, shared the merit of the defence.\r\n\r\nBefore that battery, on the memorable morning of the 1st January, 1776,\r\nfell, General Montgomery, and the chief officers of his staff, and with\r\nthem the last hopes of the Revolutionary cause in Canada.\r\n\r\nIn a paper prepared by his nephew, Lieutenant-Colonel Coffin of Ottawa,\r\nread before the Literary and Historical society of Quebec Dec. 18, 1872,\r\nit is shown on the testimony of Sir Guy Carleton, then Governor of\r\nCanada, and of Colonel Maclean, Commandant of Quebec, \"that to the\r\nresolution and watchfulness of John Coffin, in keeping the guard at the\r\n_pres de ville_ under arms, awaiting the expected attack, the coolness\r\nwith which he allowed the rebels to approach, the spirits which his\r\nexample kept up among the men, and to the critical instant when he\r\ndirected Captain Barnsfare's fire against Montgomery and his troops, is\r\nto be ascribed the repulse of the rebels from that important post where,\r\nwith their leader, they lost all heart.\"\r\n\r\nThere can be no question but that the death of Montgomery and the\r\nrepulse of this attack, saved Quebec, and with Quebec, British North\r\nAmerica to the British Crown, and that of the brave men who did this\r\ndeed John Coffin was one of the foremost.\r\n\r\nJohn Coffin died September 28, 1808, aged 78, as the record of his\r\nburial has it, \"One of His Majesty's Justices of the Peace of the City\r\nof Quebec and Inspector of Police for said City.\"\r\n\r\nHe had thirteen children born to him, 11 survived him. Directly, or\r\nindirectly, all throve under the fostering protection of the Crown and a\r\ngrateful government. The eldest daughter, Isabella, married Colonel\r\nMcMurdo. Her sons served in India, a grandson was captain in the Royal\r\nCanadian Rifles, when that fine regiment disbanded at Kingston in 1870.\r\n\r\nThe second daughter, Susannah, married the Hon. John Craigie of Quebec,\r\nProvincial Treasurer, a brother of Lord Craigie, Lord of Sessions in\r\nScotland. One son, Admiral Craigie, died in 1872. A daughter married\r\nCaptain Martin, who led one of the storming parties at the capture of\r\nFort Niagara in 1814.\r\n\r\nMARGARET, the youngest daughter, married her cousin, Roger Hale\r\nSheaffe. At the time of the marriage he was major in Brock's regiment.\r\nThat gallant officer was slain at Queenstown Heights at 7 o'clock in the\r\nmorning. At noon Colonel Sheaffe moved up from Niagara, attacked the\r\nAmerican forces and hurled them from the rocks into the river. For this\r\ngreat service he was made a Baronet.\r\n\r\nOf John Coffin's sons, the oldest, JOHN, born in Boston in 1760, died\r\nDeputy Commissary-General at Quebec, March, 1837.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM, the second son, born in Boston, 1761, obtained a commission in\r\nthe 1st Battalion of the King's Royal Regiment. Subsequently through the\r\nkind influence of His Royal Highness, the Duke of Kent, he obtained a\r\ncommission in the regular army and served half the world over. He\r\nretired from the service in 1816 a captain in the 15th Regiment and\r\nBrevet Major, and died in England in 1836. His son WILLIAM FOSTER\r\nCOFFIN, was Commissioner of Ordnance and Admiralty, Land Department of\r\nthe Interior, Canada. This gentleman married, in 1842, MARGARET, second\r\ndaughter of Isaac Winslow Clarke, of Montreal, who, in 1774, was the\r\nyoungest member of the firm of Richard Clarke and Sons of Boston, to\r\nwhich was consigned the historical cargo of tea. He rose to the rank of\r\nDeputy Commissary General, and after 50 years service died in 1822.\r\n\r\nThe third son, THOMAS COFFIN, born in Boston, 1762, was a member of the\r\nLegislative Council of Lower Canada, and Lieutenant-Colonel of Militia.\r\nHe married a Demoiselle de Tonancour and lived and died at Three Rivers,\r\n1841. A son of his was for many years Prothonotary for the District of\r\nMontreal.\r\n\r\nThe fifth son, FRANCIS HOLMES COFFIN, born in Boston, 1768, entered the\r\nRoyal Navy and served during the long war with France, and died an\r\nAdmiral in 1835. His eldest son, General Sir Isaac Coffin, K. C. Star of\r\nIndia, died at Black Heath, October, 1872.\r\n\r\nThe fourth son, NATHANIEL COFFIN, born in Boston, 1766, lived and died\r\nin Upper Canada. In the war of 1812 he joined the volunteer companies\r\nand was aide-de-camp to Sir Roger Sheaffe at the battle of Queenstown\r\nHeights, where General W. Scott was taken prisoner. He became Adjutant\r\nGeneral of Militia in Upper Canada. He died at Toronto in 1835.\r\n\r\nThe sixth son, JAMES, born in Boston, 1771, died at Quebec in 1835,\r\nAssistant Commissary-General.\r\n\r\nThese Boston men and women, sons and daughters of brave John Coffin, are\r\nall living instances of the loyal faith in which they were born, and of\r\nits honorable and just reward of a grateful and kind government, and is\r\nbut one case of many which goes to show that the Americans who were\r\nloyal, as a body fared infinitely better than the Revolutionists who\r\nwere successful. It is proverbial that republics are ungrateful.\r\n\r\nToday their descendants are organized as the United Empire Loyalists and\r\ncount it an honor that their ancestors suffered persecution and exile\r\nrather than yield the principals and the ideal of union with Great\r\nBritain. They have made of the land of their exile a mighty member of\r\nthe great British empire, they begin to glory in the days of trial\r\nthrough which they passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n      LIST OF JOHN COFFIN'S CONFISCATED ESTATES IN SUFFOLK COUNTY AND\r\n                                   TO WHOM SOLD.\r\n\r\n     To Christopher Clark, Aug. 9, 1783; Lib. 139, fol. 151; Land in\r\n       Boston, Essex St. S.; Short St. W.; Joseph Ford E.; Thomas Snow N.\r\n\r\n     To Moses Wallack, Mar. 12, 1785; Lib. 146, fol. 260; Land in\r\n       Boston, Essex St. S.; said Wallack W.; S. and W.; Blind Lane N.;\r\n       Thomas Downes and Samuel Bradley E.\r\n\r\n     To Edward Jones, Feb. 13, 1786; Lib. 155, fol. 111; Land in Boston,\r\n       Essex St. N.; the sea S.; sugar house and land of heirs of Thomas\r\n       Child deceased E.; Mary Pitman and heirs of Samuel Bradley W.; with\r\n       flats to low water mark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              JUDGE SAMUEL CURWEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe paternal ancestry of Samuel Curwen, the subject of this sketch were\r\nfor many centuries amongst the leading families in the county of\r\nCumberland, in the north of England, where the family seat Workington\r\nHall still remains, George Curwin his immediate ancestor was an early\r\nemigrant to New England, having established his residence in Salem in\r\n1638. He was highly esteemed for his active, and energetic character,\r\nand for several years represented Salem in the \"General Court\" or\r\nLegislature of the colony. He also commanded a squadron of horse in the\r\nIndian wars and assisted in checking the inroads of the savage enemy. He\r\ndied at Salem in 1685 at the age of 74 years, leaving a large estate.\r\nHis son Jonathan was of the provincial council named in the second\r\ncharter granted by William and Mary in 1691, and a judge of the superior\r\ncourt of the province. He married a daughter of Sir Henry Gibbs and\r\ntheir son George was the father of the subject of this sketch. George\r\nCurwin graduated at Harvard College in 1701 and was pastor of a church\r\nat Salem. He died in 1717 at the early age of thirty-five years. The\r\nsubject of this memoir was born in 1715 and graduated at Harvard College\r\nin 1735. In 1738 he traveled in England and the Continent. On his return\r\nhe engaged in commercial pursuits with success. His business was\r\nsubsequently interrupted by the depredation of French cruisers fitted\r\nout from Louisburg. In 1744-5 Mr. Curwin as a captain and his brother as\r\na commissary joined an expedition for the reduction of that stronghold.\r\nThe result of the expedition was completely successful, and reflected\r\ngreat credit on the participators in it.\r\n\r\nAnnexed is a cut of the Curwin House, Salem, erected by Captain Curwin\r\nin 1642, now known as the witch house. The unfortunate persons arrested\r\nduring the witchcraft delusion were examined in this house by Justices\r\nJonathan Curwin and Hawthorn before being committed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CURWIN HOUSE, SALEM. ERECTED IN 1642.]\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the Revolution Samuel Curwin was Judge of\r\nAdmiralty and had been in the commission of the peace for thirty years.\r\nHe was one of the signers of the address to Governor Hutchinson when he\r\nwent to England. This gave great offence to the disunionists, they\r\nattempted to compel him to make public recantations in the newspapers.\r\nThis he refused to do, saying that the prescribed recantation contained\r\nmore than in conscience he could own, and that to live under the\r\ncharacter of reproach, which the fury of the mob might throw upon him,\r\nwas too painful a reflection to suffer for a moment. He therefore\r\nresolved to withdraw from the impending storm. He accordingly embarked\r\nfor Philadelphia on the 23rd of April, 1775, and thence to London on the\r\n13th of the following month. While in exile he kept a journal, which has\r\nbeen published. No work extant contains so much information of the\r\nunfortunate Loyalists while abroad. The journal commences at\r\nPhiladelphia, May 4th, 1775, and says: \"Since the unhappy affairs at\r\nConcord and Lexington, finding the spirit of the people to rise on every\r\nfresh alarm, (which has been almost hourly) and their temper to get more\r\nand more soured and malevolent against all moderate men, who they see\r\nfit to reproach as enemies of their country by the name of tories, among\r\nwhom I am unhappily (although unjustly) ranked, and unable longer to\r\nbear their undeserved reproaches and menace, hourly denounced against\r\nmyself, and others, I think it a duly I owe to myself to withdraw for a\r\nwhile from the storm, which to my foreboding mind is approaching. Having\r\nin vain endeavored to persuade my wife to accompany me, her\r\napprehensions of danger from an incensed soldiery, a people licentious,\r\nand enthusiastically mad, and broke loose from all the restraints of law\r\nor religion, being less terrible to her than a short passage on the\r\nocean, and being moreover encouraged by her, I left my late peaceful\r\nhome (in my sixtieth year) in search of personal security, and those\r\nrights which by the laws of God I ought to have enjoyed undisturbed\r\nthere, and embarked at Beverly on board the schooner Lively, Captain\r\nJohnson, bound hither, on Sunday the 23rd ultimo, and have just arrived.\r\nHoping to find an asylum among quakers and Dutchmen, who I presume from\r\nformer experience have too great a regard for ease and property to\r\nsacrifice either at this time of doubtful disputation on the altar of an\r\nunknown goddess or rather doubtful divinity.\"\r\n\r\nOn landing he writes \"I went in pursuit of lodgings, and on enquiring at\r\nseveral houses, ascertained they were full or for particular reasons\r\nwould not take me in; and so many refused, as made it fearful whether\r\nlike Cain I had not a discouraging mark upon me, or a strong feature of\r\ntoryism. The whole city appears to be deep in congressional principles\r\nand inveterate against _Hutchinson Addressers_.\" Under date of May 9th,\r\n1775, he writes, \"Dined with Stephen Collins. Passed the evening at\r\nJoseph Reed's in company with Col. Washington (a fine figure and of most\r\neasy and agreeable address) Richard Henry Lee, and Col. Harrison, three\r\nof the Virginia delegates. Besides Mr. and Mrs. Reed, were Mrs.\r\nDeberatt, Dr. Shippen and Thomas Smith. I staid till twelve o'clock, the\r\nconversation being chiefly on the most feasible and prudent method of\r\nstepping up the channel of the Deleware to prevent the coming up of any\r\nlarge ships to the city. I could not perceive the least disposition to\r\naccommodate matters.\" He wrote, \"Having had several intimations that my\r\nresidence here would be unpleasant, if allowed at all, when it shall be\r\nknown that I am what is called '_an addresser_' I have therefore\r\nconsulted the few friends I think it worth while to advise with, and on\r\nthe result am determined to proceed to London in the vessel in which I\r\ncame here.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing is a brief description of the journal, which Curwin kept while\r\nin England, the four hundred and more pages contain matters of the\r\ndeepest interest to those who are interested in the lives of those\r\nLoyalists who returned to England, July 3, 1775. \"On landing at Dover,\r\nvisited the Castle. Next day arrived at the New England Coffee House,\r\nThreadneedle Street. Visited Westminster Hall with my friend Benjamin\r\nPickering. Went to old Jewery meeting-house where I met Gov. Hutchinson,\r\nand his son and daughter, and received a cordial reception and\r\ninvitation to visit him. There is an army of New Englanders here.\r\nEvening to Vauxhall Gardens. Spent the day at Hempstead in company with\r\nIsaac Smith, Samuel Quincy, David Greene, and P. Webster. I am just\r\ninformed of the most melancholy event, the destruction of Charlestown by\r\nthe King's troops, of great carnage among the officers. My distress and\r\nanxiety for my friends and countrymen embitter every hour. By invitation\r\ndined at Grocers' Company feast, at their hall in the Poultry. Dined\r\nwith Governor Hutchinson in company with Mr. Joseph Green, Mr. Manduit\r\nand Mr. Ward Nicholas Boylston. It is a capital mistake of our American\r\nfriends to expect insurrections here, there is not a shadow of hope for\r\nsuch an event. It is said most vigorous measures will take place in the\r\nspring, if no offer be made on the part of the colonies. Visited Hampton\r\nCourt, and Gardens. Thence to Windsor. From the terrace we saw almost\r\nunder our feet Eaton college. Saw Mr. Garrick in Hamlet at Drury Lane.\r\nTo the Herald's office where Parson Peters, with his friend Mr.\r\nPunderson lodges, the latter has lately arrived from Boston. It seems he\r\nwas harshly dealt with by the _sons of liberty_, being obliged to make\r\ntwo confessions to save his life notwithstanding which he was hunted,\r\npursued, and threatened, and narrowly escaped death (or the Simsbury\r\nmines to which he was finally adjudged, and he thinks with the loss of\r\nhis eyes) which would have been his fate but for his seasonable and\r\nprovidential retreat.[182] At Chapel Royal, St. James, saw the king and\r\nqueen, who joined in the service with becoming devotion. Bishop of\r\nLondon preached. To the Adelphia, Strand, where by appointment met\r\ntwenty-one of my countrymen, who have agreed on a weekly dinner here,\r\nviz., Messrs. Richard Clark, Joseph Green, Jonathan Bliss, Jonathan\r\nSewell, Joseph Waldo, S. S. Blowers, Elisha Hutchinson, Wm. Hutchinson,\r\nSamuel Sewell, Samuel Quincy, Isaac Smith, Harrison Grey, David Green,\r\nJonathan Clark, Thomas Flucker, Joseph Taylor, Daniel Silsbee, Thomas\r\nBrindley, William Cabot, John S. Copley and Nathaniel Coffin, Samuel\r\nPorter, Edward Oxnard, Benj. Pickman, Jno. Amory, Judge Robert Auchmuty\r\nand Major Urquhart, absent, are members of this New England club, as is\r\nalso Gov. Hutchinson. At Parson Peters saw Mr. Troutbeck, lately arrived\r\nfrom Halifax, and Mr. Wiswall, mutually invited each other to visit and\r\ngave cards. Drank tea at Mr. Green's in company with Gov. Hutchinson,\r\nwhom I had not seen for some weeks, and who expressed an uneasiness at\r\nmy neglect to call. I called at Mr. Copley's to see Mr. Clark and the\r\nfamily who kindly pressed my staying to tea. Was presented to Mr. West,\r\na Philadelphian, a most masterly hand in historic painting. Mr. West is\r\nthe king's history painter. Called on my friend Browne. He acquainted\r\nme with some facts relative to the unfortunate abandonment of Boston by\r\nthe king's troops, which has all the appearance of being forced. Would\r\nto God this illjudged, unnatural quarrel was ended.\"\r\n\r\n  [182] For description of Simsbury mines see pp. 56-57.\r\n\r\nWent to Shepton Mallet.[183] Walked to the market-cross, an open\r\nstructure supported by Gothic arches and pillars, and ornamented in\r\nfront by a few mutilated statues, but whether of saints or heroes of\r\nantiquity, I know not. A few gentlemen of fortune live here, but many\r\nworthy clothiers. Walked with Mr. Morgan over the hills to the remains\r\nof Roman-way, the ditch continues, although in an imperfect state, and\r\ncarried over the Meridep hills, running from north to south and from\r\nshore to shore. Rode to Bath. Met Col. Saltonstall who with Mr.\r\nBoyleston has taken lodgings here for sometime past. Visited Glastonbury\r\nAbbey ruins. In the Bristol Gazette is the following: 'Gov. Howe has\r\nlanded the British army and taken possession of New York on the 15th of\r\nSeptember, the provincials had fled from the city with great\r\nprecipitation, towards Kingsbridge.' There have been some discouraging\r\naccounts from France, respecting the intention of that court to assist\r\nthe colonies, and advices from Spain say their ports are open to the\r\nEnglish colonists. Received a letter informing me of my wife's health,\r\nand that she had been obliged to pay ten pounds sterling to find a man\r\nfor the American army in my stead. Dec. 14. This day, General Burgoyne's\r\nmortifying capitulation arrived in town. We all know the General's\r\nbravery, and skill. He did not surrender whilst there was a possibility\r\nof defence. On confirmation of the American news, Manchester offered to\r\nraise a thousand men at their own expense, to be ready for service in\r\nAmerica in two months, and was soon followed after by Liverpool. It is\r\nsaid there are to be proposals for raising two thousand men out of each\r\nparish through the kingdom.\r\n\r\n  [183] The native town of the author, J. H. Stark.\r\n\r\nLord North, has proposed terms of reconciliation, but nothing short of\r\nindependency will go down with the colonies. France will support them,\r\nall thoughts of conquest, of unconditional submission, be assured are\r\ngiven up. I am fully convinced the colonies will never find any good\r\npurpose answered by independence. God only knows what is before us. I\r\ncannot review the state of Great Britain four years since, and regard\r\nthe present crisis without horror, without trembling. France and Spain\r\nare armed from head to foot at all points ready to sally forth. Heard\r\nthe dreaded sound, war declared against France.\r\n\r\nExeter, Sept. 6. Am informed that I am suspected to be an American spy\r\ndisaffected to government. Have heard that Paul Jones in the French\r\nking's service, has taken a forty-four gun frigate, and entered the\r\nharbor of Hull and destroyed sixteen ships.\r\n\r\nVisited Col. Erving and family, afterwards dined and took tea with my\r\nworthy friend Judge Sewall, his company Mr. and Mrs. Faneuil. From\r\nthence I went to see Mrs. Gardner, her husband the doctor, and their\r\ndaughter Love Eppes. Meeting Colonel Oliver, late lieutenant-governor of\r\nMassachusetts, he informed me of his residence.\r\n\r\nVisited Mr. Lechmere, drank tea with Judge Sewall, Captain Carpenter,\r\nyoung Jonathan Gardner, both of Salem, and a Mr. Leavitt, having arrived\r\nin a cartel ship from Boston, dined and passed the afternoon and\r\nevening. From them I obtained much information relating to our country\r\nand town. Those who five years, ago were the \"_meaner people_\" are now\r\nby a strange revolution become the only men of power, riches and\r\ninfluence. Those who, on the contrary, were leaders in the highest line\r\nof life, are glad at this time to be unknown, and unnoticed, to escape\r\ninsult, and plunder, the wretched condition of all who are not violent,\r\nand adopters of republican principles. The Cabots of Beverly, who you\r\nknow, had but five years ago a very moderate share of property, are now\r\nsaid to be by far the most wealthy in New England. It is a melancholy\r\ntruth that whilst some are wallowing in undeserved wealth, that plunder\r\nand rapine has thrown into their hands, the wisest, most peaceable and\r\nmost deserving such as you and I know are now suffering want,\r\naccompanied by many indignities that a licentious, lawless people can\r\npour forth upon them.\r\n\r\nThe number of Americans in Bristol are compiled in the following list:\r\nCol. Oliver and six daughters. Mr. R. Lechmere, his brother Nicholas,\r\nwith wife and two daughters. Mr. John Vassal, wife and niece, Miss\r\nDavis, Mr. Barnes, wife and niece, Miss Arbuthnot, Mr. Nathaniel Coffin,\r\nwife and family. Mr. Robert Hallowell, wife and children. Judge Sewell,\r\nwife, sister, and two sons. Samuel Sewall with his kinsman. Mr. Faneuil,\r\nand wife. Mr. Francis Waldo and Mr. Simpson, together with Mrs. Borland,\r\na son and three daughters.\r\n\r\nApril 24, 1780. This day, five years are completed since I abandoned my\r\nhouse, estate, effects and friends. God only knows whether I shall ever\r\nbe restored to them, or they to me. Party rage, like jealousy and\r\nsuperstition is cruel as the grave;--that moderation is a crime and in\r\ntimes of civil confusions, many good, virtuous and peaceable persons\r\nnow suffering banishment from America are the wretched proofs and\r\ninstances. By letter from Salem from our friend Pynchon, all our friends\r\nthere are well and longing, but almost without hope, for the good old\r\ntimes as is the common saying now except among those as he expresses it,\r\nwhose enormous heaps have made them easy and insolent, and to wish for\r\na continuance of those confusions by which they grow rich.\r\n\r\nLondon, Oct. 30th, 1781. To Samuel Sewell, Esq., You wish me to write\r\nyou favorable news from America. Would to God such was to be found\r\nwritten in the book of fate. The French you know are in possession of\r\nthe Chesapeake, with a much superior fleet to that of Great Britain, for\r\nthey reckon thirty-six capital ships to our twenty-four, even after\r\nDigby's junction. General Cornwallis's royal master is in the utmost\r\ndistress for him, who, all the world here fears to hear will have been\r\n_Burgoyned_ and therefore an end to this cursed, ill-omened quarrel,\r\nthough not in a way they wish, for which the instigators and continuers\r\ndeserve execution. At New England Coffee House heard the glorious news\r\nof Admiral Rodney's defeat and capture of the French Admiral de Grasse,\r\nwith five capital ships and one sunk.\r\n\r\nLondon, March 17, 1783. Before the preliminaries are ratified or\r\nhostilities ceased in the channel an American ship laden with oil, with\r\nthirteen stripes flying, came into the river from Nantucket. The ship,\r\nCaptain Holton Johnson of Lynn, with whom I came from America, was, by a\r\nrevolution common at such periods translated into a legislator in our\r\nMassachusetts Assembly, being about two months in London, told me that\r\nhad not his interests and efforts prevailed, my name would have been\r\ninserted in the banishment list, and my estate confiscated, the reason,\r\nif any, must be private spite and malice, no public crime was ever\r\nalleged, but merely leaving the country in her distress. If success is\r\njustification, I confess my guilt. Read a Boston newspaper, where I saw\r\npoor Coomb's estate in Marblehead advertised for sale. I really pity my\r\npoor fellow refugee and think him cruelly treated by his savage\r\ntownsmen. At New England Coffee House to read the papers filled with\r\nrelations of the rising spirit of Americans against the refugees, in\r\ntheir towns and assemblies. Intoxicated by success under no fear of\r\npunishment, they give an unrestrained loose to their angry, malevolent\r\npassions attribute to the worst of causes the opposition to their\r\nlicentious, mobbish violation of all laws human and divine; and even\r\nsome of the best of the republican party seem to think at least their\r\npractice squints that way, that the supposed goodness of their cause\r\nwill justify murder, rapine, and the worst of crimes. But cool impartial\r\nposterity will pass a better judgment, and account for the violence of\r\nthe times from party rage which knows no bounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAMUEL CURWEN.\r\n\r\nBorn at Salem in 1715. Judge of Admiralty. Died at Salem in 1802.]\r\n\r\nLondon, Aug. 9, 1783. By the newspapers from America, particularly our\r\nquarter, I find there but slender grounds of hope for success in\r\nattempting the recovery of debts or estates; a general shipwreck is\r\nseemingly intended of all absentees' property--the towns in their\r\ninstructions to the representatives making it a point to prevent the\r\nreturn of them, and consequent confiscations of all their property,\r\nnotwithstanding the provision in the fifth preliminary article. These\r\nlawless people regard not any obstacle when the gratification of their\r\nangry passions or the object of gain are in view. For an explicit\r\nanswer, \"Do you propose to spend the remainder of your days abroad?\" The\r\nwished for period of my return is not arrived, it is a subject I\r\nconsider with some indifference, age and infirmities having made such\r\ninroads on my constitution as leave me but little to hope, or fear from\r\nthe result of public councils, or the imprudence of private conduct. I\r\nam free to declare my apprehension that the lower, illiterate classes,\r\nnarrow-minded and illiberal all over the world, have too much influence.\r\nOct. 6. This day was proclaimed peace with France, Spain, and Holland.\r\nAt New England Coffee House in company with Mr. Nathaniel Gorham,\r\nlately arrived from Boston, whom I had well known. He is a native of\r\nCharlestown, late a member of Congress, and of the Massachusetts\r\nAssembly, and who is now here on the score of obtaining a benevolence\r\nfor the sufferers at the destruction of that town June 17, 1775, by the\r\nking's troops, which all things considered, carries with it such a face\r\nof effrontery as is not to be matched. Invited him to tea; received a\r\nletter from my wife's brother, James Russell. To him he replied, I thank\r\nyou for your favor of the 21st of August, the first from you since my\r\nunhappy abandoning my former home in April, '75. In truth, were your\r\nsister (Mrs. Curwin) no more, there would need no act of Massachusetts,\r\nor any other assembly, or senate to prohibit my return. To his wife he\r\nwrites: If it was not for your sake, or that you would follow my fortune\r\nor accompany my fate, I should not hesitate for a moment taking up my\r\nfuture abode, which cannot possibly be but of short continuance,\r\nsomewhere out of the limits of the republican government. Wishes for the\r\nwelfare of my friends still warm my heart, as to the rest, I read with\r\ncold indifference the insurrection in Pennsylvania, and the carryings-on\r\nin the late English colonies, having lost local attachment. If your\r\nfortitude has increased in the proportion that your health and spirits\r\nhave improved, perhaps you will not find it an insurmountable difficulty\r\nto resolve on a land tour to Canada, or a voyage to some other English\r\nsettlement. Whatever shall be the result of your thoughts let me be made\r\nacquainted therewith as soon as convenient. Should a final expulsion be\r\nconcluded on, you will no longer hesitate. Captain Nathaniel West brings\r\nme a message from the principal merchants and citizens of Salem\r\nproposing and encouraging my return which instance of moderation I view\r\nas an honor to the town and respectful to myself. It affords me\r\npleasure, and I would cheerfully accept the offer, but should the\r\npopular dislike rise against me, to what a plight should I be reduced,\r\nbeing at present (out for how long is a painful uncertainty) on the\r\nBritish government list for L100 a year (a competency for a single\r\nperson exercising strict economy) to surrender this precarious allowance\r\nwithout public assurance of personal security. Imagine to yourself the\r\ndistress of an old man, without health under such adverse circumstances\r\nand you will advise me to wait with resignation till the several\r\nAssemblies shall have taken decisive measures. Went to the Treasury and\r\nthere received the agreeable information that the commissioners had\r\ngranted my petition to appoint an agent to receive my quarterly\r\nallowance, after my departure from England, on making satisfactory proof\r\nof my being alive at the successive periods of payment. From this date\r\nan end to my doubts respecting my embarkation, its issue time must\r\nreveal. I know not in what employment I am to pass the small remainder\r\nof my days, should Providence permit my safe return home, but I shall\r\nnot think part of it ill-bestowed in directing and assisting the studies\r\nand pursuits of my niece's children who are just of an age to receive\r\nuseful ideas--with regard to the English, Latin, and Greek tongues.\r\nSept. 25, 1784. Arrived at Boston at half past three o'clock. Landed at\r\nthe end of Long Wharf after an absence of nine years and five months,\r\noccasioned by a lamented civil war. By plunder and rapine some have\r\naccumulated wealth, but many more are greatly injured in their\r\ncircumstances. Some have to lament over the wreck of their departed\r\nwealth and estates, of which pitiable number I am, my affairs sunk into\r\nirretrievable ruin. On Sunday, being the day following, I left for\r\nSalem, where I alighted at the house of my former residence, and not a\r\nman, woman, or child, but expressed a satisfaction at seeing me, and\r\nwelcomed me back. The melancholy derangement of my affairs has so\r\nentirely unsettled me, that I can scarcely attend to anything. I think\r\nit very unlikely that my home can be saved.[184] Salem, Nov. 22, 1784.\r\nJudge Curwin wrote to his friend Judge Sewall, Bristol, England, saying:\r\n\"I find myself completely ruined. I confess I cannot bear to stay and\r\nperish under the ruins of my late ample property and shall therefore as\r\nsoon as I can recover my account-books, left in Philadelphia on my\r\ndeparture from America and settle my deranged affairs, retreat to Nova\r\nScotia, unless my allowance be taken from me.\" He however remained at\r\nSalem where he passed the remainder of his days dying in 1802 at the age\r\nof eighty-six. The foregoing brief abstracts from Curwin's Journal give\r\nsome of the things which he saw and heard, and the hopes and fears which\r\nagitated him and his fellow exiles. He left no children. Samuel Curwin\r\nWard, a grandson of his brother George, at the request of Judge Curwin,\r\ntook his name by an act of the Legislature, and his descendants are all\r\nthat now bear the name in New England.\r\n\r\n  [184] It was saved from confiscation by his wife remaining in it during\r\n  the war, and her furnishing a substitute for her husband to serve in the\r\n  army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              JAMES MURRAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Murray was a direct descendant of Sir John Murray of Philiphaugh,\r\nScotland, who sat in Parliament for the County of Selkirk in 1612. Sir\r\nJohn's second son, was John Murray of Bowhill. This John Murray was the\r\nfather of John Murray of Unthank, born in 1677, who in turn was the\r\nfather of James Murray, the subject of this notice, who was born in 1713\r\nat Unthank. Here on this ancestral estate he passed the first fifteen\r\nyears of his life, after the wholesome manner of Scotch\r\nlads--porridge-fed, bare legged--he protested in after life against his\r\ngrandson wearing stockings. The people amongst whom he lived had\r\nmarried, thriven and multiplied until the population had become one vast\r\ncousinship, bound together by that clannish loyalty which, quite apart\r\nfrom pride of name, is ineradicable in the Scots to the present day.\r\nThrough the influence of Sir John Murray he was apprenticed to William\r\nDunbar of London, a merchant in the West India trade. On the death of\r\nhis father, he received a thousand pounds as his share of the estate.\r\nWith this small patrimony he decided to try his fortune in the New\r\nWorld. His objective point in his new venture was the Cape Fear Region\r\nin North Carolina. The Carolinas having shaken off their proprietary\r\nrule were now entering, it was hoped, upon a more prosperous period as\r\ndependencies of the Crown. Gabriel Johnson, a Scotchman who had been a\r\nphysician and professor at St. Andrews University, had been recently\r\nappointed Governor. This made some stir in Scottish circles, a fact\r\nwhich directed James Murray's desire to this particular Colony. With\r\nletters of recommendation to Governor Johnson, he embarked at Gravesend,\r\nSeptember 20, 1735, for Charleston. He settled at Wilmington, on the\r\nCape Fear River, and purchased a house in town and a plantation of 500\r\nacres and Negro slaves. He was also appointed collector of the Port, and\r\nin 1729 he was appointed a member of the Board of Councillors. In 1737\r\nMr. Murray received news of the death of his mother. This necessitated a\r\njourney to Scotland to settle her estate. On returning he brought with\r\nhim his younger brother and his sister Elizabeth, not quite fourteen\r\nyears of age. She was installed as his housekeeper, and then began that\r\naffectionate intimacy between them which was perhaps the most vital and\r\nenduring element in the life of each. James Murray prospered as a\r\nplanter and merchant. He imported from England such goods as the\r\ncolonists required and in exchange sent to England naval stores, tar,\r\npitch, and turpentine.\r\n\r\nIn 1744 he returned to Scotland with his sister Elizabeth, married his\r\ncousin, Barbara Bennet, and remained in England and Scotland for five\r\nyears. On his return in 1749, accompanied by his wife and daughter and\r\nhis sister Elizabeth, their ship put into Boston, and he returned alone\r\nto Wilmington, leaving his family in Boston, because, as he wrote, \"they\r\nhad an opportunity of spending three of the most disagreeable months of\r\nthis climate in that poor Healthy Place, New England--their health they\r\nowe to God's goodness, their poverty to their own bad policy and to\r\ntheir Popular Government.\" His sister Elizabeth remained in Boston and\r\nmarried Thomas Campbell, a Scotchman, merchant and trader. Their married\r\nlife was short, for the husband died in a few years.\r\n\r\nA comfortable, prosperous figure in Boston at that time was Mr. James\r\nSmith, a Scotchman, a sugar-baker, whose refinery had been in working\r\nsince 1729 or before and who had amassed wealth as well as years. His\r\nhome on Queen Street, now Court Street, was central in position,\r\nsurrounded by other residences of its kind, yet conveniently near his\r\nsugar house, which stood in Brattle Street, between the old church and\r\nwhat was known as Wing's Lane. At the same time it was not far from\r\nKing's Chapel. As one of the Church Wardens of King's Chapel and a\r\ngenerous contributor to its needs Mr. Smith stood high in the esteem of\r\nhis fellow townsmen and the few allusions to him in the records and\r\ntraditions of his day indicate that he was no less genial a friend than\r\nan open handed citizen. Mr. Smith married Mrs. Campbell in 1760. \"I can\r\nassure you,\" wrote James Murray in 1761, \"they both enjoy a happiness\r\nwhich is rarely met with in a match of such disparity.\" Her brother\r\nrejoiced in this marriage, which he declared placed her \"in the best\r\ncircumstances of any of her sex in the town.\" Prosperity for one member\r\nof the family must help for all. Boston thus became a second home for\r\nthe Murrays in America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COUNTY RESIDENCE OF JAMES SMITH, BRUSH HILL, MILTON.\r\n\r\nBUILT IN 1734.]\r\n\r\nShortly after his sister's marriage he lost his wife and all his\r\nchildren but two, owing to the unhealthy climate. This caused him to\r\nleave the South and his opinion of New England was changed, for he wrote\r\nat this time, 1760, \"you cannot well imagine what a land of health,\r\nplenty and contentment this is among all ranks, vastly improved within\r\nthese ten years. The war on this continent has been a blessing to the\r\nEnglish subjects and a calamity to the French, especially in the\r\nNorthern Colonies, for we have got nothing by it in Carolina.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1761 Mr. Murray married Miss Thompson, a daughter of Mrs. Mackay, who\r\nlived on King Street. The marriage proved to be a fortunate one for Mr.\r\nMurray's two daughters as well as for the two most concerned. Mr. Smith\r\nwas withdrawing from the sugar business and wished Mr. Murray to take it\r\nup. He was, however, in no haste to be off from his plantation, which\r\nhe really loved, but at last the break was made and in 1765 he removed\r\nto Boston to cast in his lot permanently. Mr. Murray had warm friends in\r\nBoston and felt himself in congenial surroundings. He occupied Mr.\r\nSmith's home on the corner of Queen Street, the Smiths reserving a\r\nportion of it for themselves, though their permanent residence was now\r\nat Brush Hill, Milton. Mr. Smith had purchased in 1734, and\r\nsubsequently, 300 acres at Brush Hill and erected the mansion house now\r\nowned and occupied by Murray Howe.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith's long life came to an end on the 4th of March, 1769. He died\r\nat Brush Hill and was buried from his home on Queen Street. Mrs. Smith\r\nreturned to Scotland and before leaving she made over to her brother the\r\nBrush Hill Farm, in trust for his daughters, Dorothy and Elizabeth. This\r\nwas very fortunate, as it afterwards turned out, for it saved it from\r\nconfiscation. Mr. Murray, with much content, established himself there,\r\nhoping to \"run off the dregs of his days\" in peace. Of the farm he had\r\ngiven his brother, some years before, a graphic description; it was in\r\nmany respects as pleasantly situated as Governor Hutchinson's. It had,\r\nhe said \"a good house, well furnished, good garden and orchards, meadows\r\nand pasturage, in 300 acres. A riverlet washed it and by several\r\nwindings lost itself between two bushy hills, before it ran into the\r\ngreat bay. Of this bay, often covered with sails, and of the\r\nlight-house, there is a fair prospect from the house which stands on an\r\neminence and overlooks also a pleasant country round. It is in short one\r\nof the pleasantest and most convenient seats I see in the country.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy Murray, who, family traditions say, had grown to be a beautiful\r\nand fascinating young lady, accepted the hand of Rev. John Forbes, a\r\nclergyman then settled at St. Augustine, Florida. Their marriage\r\noccurred in 1769. The Forbes of Milton are the descendants.\r\n\r\nThe political turmoil in the midst of which Mr. Murray found himself\r\nupon his removal to Boston, in 1765, filled him with surprise and\r\ndismay. He had hoped, on leaving North Carolina, that he was turning his\r\nback upon rebellion, but here he had alighted upon the very seat of\r\ndisorder. By force of circumstances, as well as by inclination, it was\r\ninevitable that in North Carolina, and afterwards in Massachusetts, his\r\nassociates should have been those whose sympathies were on the side of\r\nlaw and order. The Boston of the disunionists, of Otis, Hancock, and the\r\n\"brace of Adams\" he never knew. \"He shared so completely Hutchinson's\r\nconvictions that the best interests of America were being sacrificed\" by\r\nthe very men who maintained they were asserting their rights and\r\nalthough, like those who sided with the Government, he incurred\r\nsuspicion and hatred, he never to the end of his life could see himself\r\nas an enemy to the land he helped to build.[185]\r\n\r\n  [185] James Murray, Loyalist; pp. 152, 154, 155.\r\n\r\nTo such men as him, men who were averse to partisanship and whose\r\ninterests centered wholly within the domestic circle, yet who could\r\ntake a large impersonal view of passing events, the inevitable ban\r\nunder which, as Tories, they afterward fell, bore all the sting of\r\ninjustice. He wrote in 1766, \"the truth is we are all the children of a\r\nmost indulgent Parent, who has never asserted his authority over us,\r\nuntil we are grown almost to manhood and act accordingly; but were I to\r\nsay so here before our Chief Ruler, the Mob, or any of their adherents,\r\nI should presently have my house turned inside out.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the troops sent by General Gage from New York arrived in Boston and\r\nwere refused shelter in various places under control of the\r\ndisunionists, Mr. Murray came forward and the sugar house was opened to\r\nthem for barracks. Thenceforth \"Murray's Barracks\" or \"Smith's\r\nBarracks,\" as they were indiscriminately called, were a source of\r\nirritation to the disloyal section of the town. Moreover, his\r\nwillingness to lodge British soldiers, and a free hospitality shown to\r\nBritish officers (among others who frequented his house was General\r\nMackay, a relative, probably, of his wife) marked Mr. Murray as a King's\r\nman. His appointment in 1768 as a Justice of the Peace drew him still\r\nfurther into public notice. Popular displeasure in fact, so far\r\ndistinguished him as to make him, in the autumn of the next year, the\r\nvictim of a mob. The condition of affairs was rapidly growing worse. The\r\ntroops were called from Murray's barracks to protect the guard on King's\r\nStreet from the fury of the mob and this brought about the so-called\r\n\"State Street Massacre.\" Then followed the Lexington affair and Bunker\r\nHill and the siege of Boston by Washington's army. During this time Mr.\r\nMurray remained in Boston. His daughter, Mrs. Forbes, had returned from\r\nFlorida and with her sister Elizabeth, lived on the farm at Brush Hill.\r\nHis sister, Elizabeth Smith, had married Ralph Inman of Cambridge and\r\nwhile her husband remained in Boston, she stayed in the Cambridge\r\nmansion to prevent its being confiscated. Communications between Milton\r\nand Boston were carried on by vessels sailing up the Neponset.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Murray visited Brush Hill in this manner and Mrs. Inman\r\neven journeyed back and forth between Cambridge, Boston and Milton in\r\nthis way. Finally the evil day came when the evacuation of Boston became\r\na necessity. The consternation was indescribable. Men who had lived all\r\ntheir lives in Boston and were a part and parcel of it found themselves\r\nsuddenly compelled to take leave of friends, old associations and\r\nproperty and to flee with the army to Nova Scotia. The departure of\r\nGeneral Howe was hampered and delayed by the necessity of caring for the\r\nremoval of the Loyalists. All the transports which were at hand,\r\nassisted by such other vessels as could be procured, were inadequate for\r\nthe purpose. The refugees, on their part, were in a state of distraction\r\nbetween the impossibility of taking with them more than a small part of\r\ntheir possessions. Mr. Murray, like the rest, had no recourse but to\r\nsail with the troops for Halifax. The parting he must have believed to\r\nbe only temporary, but it was final.\r\n\r\nA lady writing from Brush Hill under date of May 17th, 1776, and signing\r\nherself E. F., gives a graphic description of the condition in which the\r\nMurray family were left. She writes, \"This amiable family are going to\r\nbe involved in new troubles. Did I fear for myself alone, I should be\r\nhappy compared with what I now suffer, for I have nothing to fear from\r\nthe malevolence of man, but when I see the few but valuable friends I\r\nhave remaining upon the point of becoming destitute like myself my heart\r\nsinks within me, and I can not avoid exclaiming \"Great God!\" Surely for\r\nall these things people shall be brought to judgment. I am hunted from\r\none retreat to another, and since I left your Ark, like Noah's dove I\r\ncan find no resting place. The Committee at Cambridge have left Mrs.\r\nInman's farm, in spite of all assiduity to prevent it and the same tribe\r\nof demons have been here to take this into possession during the life of\r\nMr. Murray. When this affair will end, God knows. Nature is all blooming\r\nand benevolent around us. I wish to Heaven that she could inspire the\r\nbreasts of this deluded people with the same affectionate glow towards\r\neach other. _May eternal curses fall on the heads of those who have been\r\ninstrumental to this country's ruin._\"\r\n\r\nAgain under the date of June 16th she writes, \"Rejoice with me, my dear\r\nAunt, _this infernal crew cannot succeed in taking the farm from this\r\namiable family_. _The Almighty Father of infinite perfection will not\r\npermit them to prosper in all their wickedness._\"[186]\r\n\r\n  [186] James Murray, Loyalist; pp. 248, 249, 251.\r\n\r\nJames Murray now began the weary life of banishment, the pathos of which\r\nwas so many times repeated in the history of the Loyalist exiles. He\r\nfirst went to Halifax; there he established himself with his wife and\r\nhis sister, Mrs. Gordon, but he could not be content to stay so far from\r\nhis sister and his children, who remained in Boston to prevent their\r\nproperty from being confiscated, and soon, as he puts it, he came\r\n\"creeping towards\" them, hoping at least to be able more easily to\r\ncommunicate with them and to serve them by sending occasional supplies.\r\nHe visited Newport, New York and Philadelphia. He found himself,\r\nhowever, no nearer the accomplishment of his wishes in New York than in\r\nHalifax and to Halifax, in 1778, after some two years spent in\r\nprofitless wanderings, he returned. There he remained the rest of his\r\nlife. In his last letter to his daughter dated Halifax, February 17th,\r\n1781, he said \"A man near seventy, if in his senses, _can want but\r\nlittle here below, nor want that little long_. Therefore the withdrawing\r\nof my salary for some time past gives me but little concern.\" In this\r\nletter he seems to have had a premonition of his death, for he died a\r\nfew months later. The salary that he refers to was that which he\r\nreceived from England for several years after leaving Boston--about 150\r\nPounds a year as inspector of imports and exports, many sufferers\r\nreceived from 50 to 300 Pounds a year in addition to their salary for\r\ntheir present subsistence. Mrs. Inman, his sister, survived her brother\r\nbut a few years and those were sad ones. Her friends were scattered,\r\nher means reduced and her health undermined. She died May 25, 1785.\r\n\r\nELIZABETH MURRAY, his daughter, married Edward Hutchinson Robbins, who\r\nin 1780, when but twenty-two years of age, became a member of the\r\ndisloyal government and who occupied the position of Speaker of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, Lieutenant Governor and Judge of Probate.\r\nBrush Hill afterwards passed into the possession of her son, James\r\nMurray Robbins, who lived here until his death in 1885. It then passed\r\ninto the possession of his nephew, James Murray Howe, its present\r\noccupant.\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, the only thing that prevented the confiscation of\r\nthis estate was that Elizabeth and Dorothy Murray, to whom their aunt\r\nhad given it had remained on the property during the war and would not\r\nleave it, although every effort was made to drive them off it by their\r\ndisloyal neighbors. Their father was proscribed and banished under the\r\nAct of 1778, he was forbidden to return to Massachusetts and for a time\r\ndid not even dare to write to his family. A daughter of Mary Robbins\r\nmarried a son of Paul Revere. Two of their sons fell upon the\r\nbattlefield in the war for the Union, fighting on the loyal side in\r\nsupport of their government, giving to their country on the one hand\r\nlives derived from the disunionists and on the other from their loyal\r\nancestor.\r\n\r\nRev. John Forbes wrote to his wife in 1783, just previous to his death,\r\nas follows: \"Upon hearing of the peace, having all my property in\r\nFlorida, I thought of going immediately to England. I might be of use to\r\nmyself either by giving a short representation of the importance of\r\nretaining the province under the Crown of Great Britain or in finding\r\nearly what hopes I might entertain of being in a situation of remaining\r\nin England with my united family, when the boys might be educated under\r\nmy eye.\" After Mr. Forbes' death his wife, Dorothy Forbes, hoping to\r\nrecover something from his estate as well as from her father's, made a\r\ntrip to Wilmington and St. Augustine. The land which Mr. Forbes owned in\r\nFlorida, which had been given over to the Spaniards, she received\r\ncompensation for from the British Government. In Wilmington, however,\r\nshe did not succeed, for when her father went to Boston he turned over\r\nhis Cape Fear estate, which he valued at that time at L3000, to his\r\nnephew, Thomas Clark, who had recently come over from England. After the\r\nwar commenced, the whole of Mr. Murray's property was confiscated. It\r\nwas then claimed by Thomas Clark, who presented an account for more than\r\nthe assessed value of the property for his salary for caring for it. As\r\nhe had joined the disunionists it was ultimately made over to him by act\r\nof the Legislature. Mrs. Forbes tried to recover some of her patrimony,\r\nbut without success. She did not even see her cousin, who wrote from his\r\nplantation that floods prevented his leaving his estate to visit\r\nWilmington but that if she would come to him he would be happy to see\r\nher and did not doubt of being able to convince her that he had acted\r\nfor the best in what he did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SIR BENJAMIN THOMPSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nBenjamin Thompson, otherwise known as Count Rumford was one of the most\r\ndistinguished men of his age. He came on both sides of his parentage\r\nfrom the original stock of the first colonists of Massachusetts Bay.\r\nJAMES THOMPSON, one of the original settlers of Woburn, was prominent\r\namong those who fixed their residence in that part of the town now known\r\nas North Woburn. Little is known of his English antecedents except that\r\nhe was born in 1593, his wife's name was Elizabeth and by her he had\r\nthree sons and one daughter all probably born in England. As early as\r\n1630 when he was thirty-seven he joined the company of about fifteen\r\nhundred persons who under lead of Governor Winthrop landed on New\r\nEngland shores during the eventful year. He was one of the first\r\nsettlers of Charlestown and belonged to sturdy yeomanry of the country.\r\nHe was among the few adventurers who early pushed their way into an\r\nunknown region and fixed their home in the wilderness, with Henry\r\nBaldwin and a few others, in that part of Charlestown Village now known\r\nas North Woburn. James Thompson was twice married. Elizabeth died\r\nNovember 13, 1643, and he married February 15, 1644, Susannah Blodgett,\r\nwidow of Thomas Blodgett of Cambridge. The descendants of this early\r\nsettler are now very numerous in the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRTHPLACE OF BENJAMIN THOMPSON, NORTH WOBURN.]\r\n\r\nJonathan Thompson, son of the former had a son Jonathan who had a son\r\nEbenezer. Captain Ebenezer Thompson and Hannah Converse were the\r\ngrandparents, Benjamin Thompson, the son of the last, and Ruth Simonds\r\nwere the father and mother of the celebrated Count Rumford. His mother\r\nwas the daughter of an officer who performed distinguished service in\r\nthe French and Indian wars, which were in progress at the time of the\r\nbirth of his eminent grandson. The parents were married in 1752, and\r\nwent to live at the house of Captain Ebenezer Thompson. Here under his\r\ngrandfather's roof, the future Count Rumford was born, March 26, 1753,\r\nin the west end of the strong substantial farm-house. The father of the\r\nlittle boy died November 7, 1754, in his twenty-sixth year, leaving his\r\nwife and her child to the care and support of the grandparents. In\r\nMarch, 1756, when the child was three years old, his widowed mother was\r\nmarried to Josiah Pierce, the younger, of Woburn. Mr. Pierce took his\r\nwife and her child to a new home, which, now removed, stood but a short\r\ndistance from the old homestead.\r\n\r\nEllis in his \"Life of Count Rumford\" says, that Benjamin Franklin and\r\nBenjamin Thompson were the two men most distinguished for philosophical\r\ngenius of all that have been produced on the soil of this continent.\r\n\"They came into life in humble homes within twelve miles of each other,\r\nunder like straits and circumstances of frugality and substantial\r\nthrift. They both sprang from English lineage, of an ancestry and\r\nparentage yeoman of the soil on either continent, to be cast, as their\r\nprogenitors had been, upon their own exertions, without dependence upon\r\ninherited means, or patronage, or even good fortune. Born as subjects of\r\nthe English monarch, they both, at different periods of their lives,\r\nclaimed their privileges as such, visiting their ancestral soil, though\r\nunder widely unlike circumstances, and their winning fame and\r\ndistinction for services to humanity. We almost forget the occasion\r\nwhich parted them in the sphere of politics, because they come so close\r\ntogether in the more engrossing and beneficent activity of their\r\ngenius.\" It is not known whether these two men ever met together, or\r\nsought each other's acquaintance, or even recognized each other's\r\nexistence, though they were contemporaries for more than thirty years.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Thompson in his youth attended the village grammar school.\r\nLater he was apprenticed to Mr. John Appleton, an importer of British\r\ngoods at Salem, and later still was for a short time a clerk in a dry\r\ngoods store in Boston where he was when the \"Massacre\" occurred. It was\r\nwhile at Salem he first displayed his fondness for experimental\r\nphilosophy, when accidentally his face was somewhat marked by a\r\npyrotechnical explosion. He used to steal moments to play the fiddle as\r\nhe was passionately fond of music. Lacking taste for trade he engaged in\r\nthe study of medicine with Dr. Hay of Woburn, meanwhile in company with\r\nhis friend and neighbor, Loammie Baldwin, walking to and fro from\r\nCambridge, in order to attend scientific lectures at Harvard College. At\r\nlength he became a teacher, first in Wilmington, then in Bradford and\r\nthen in a more permanent and lucrative position in Concord, New\r\nHampshire, then a part of Essex County, Massachusetts; once known as\r\nPenacook but at this time as Rumford. His more public and noticeable\r\nlife now began. Here he married at the early age of nineteen Sarah, the\r\nwidow of Colonel Rolfe and the daughter of the Rev. Timothy Walker. When\r\nhe went to Concord as a teacher he was in the glory of his youth, and\r\nhis friend Baldwin describes him as of a fine manly make and figure,\r\nnearly six feet in height, of handsome features, bright blue eyes, and\r\ndark auburn hair. He had the manners and polish of a gentleman, with\r\nfascinating ways, and an ability to make himself agreeable. His diligent\r\nstudy and love of learning also added to his attractions. He was married\r\nabout November, 1772, and his wife brought to him a fortune. It was at\r\nabout this time that Benjamin Thompson met Governor Wentworth,--an event\r\nwhich led to that series of difficulties and troubles which resulted in\r\nhis leaving the country. The governor was struck by the young man's\r\ncommanding appearance, and a vacancy having occurred in a majorship in\r\nthe Second Provincial Regiment of New Hampshire, Governor Wentworth at\r\nonce commissioned Thompson to fill it. Thus the young man received an\r\nappointment over the heads of other officers of age and experience. It\r\nwas a mistake on the part of the governor and a mistake for him to\r\naccept the office. The veteran officers over whom he had been appointed\r\nso suddenly and unexpectedly from the plain life of a civilian were very\r\nangry as was to be expected.\r\n\r\nYoung Thompson manifested in early manhood the tastes, aptitudes and\r\ncravings which prompt their possessor, however humbly born, and under\r\nwhatever repression from surrounding influence, to push his way in the\r\nworld by seeking and winning the patronage of his social superiors, who\r\nhave favor and distinctions to bestow. He was regarded from his boyhood\r\nas being above his position; he had also a noble and imposing figure,\r\nwith great personal beauty, and with those whose acquaintance he\r\ncultivated he was most affable and winning in his manners. His marriage\r\nenabling him to give over the necessity of school keeping, furnished him\r\nthe means for making excursions at his pleasure. Besides his\r\nacquaintance with Governor Wentworth at Portsmouth, he had also on\r\nvisits with his wife to Boston, been introduced to Governor Gage and\r\nseveral of the British officers, and had partaken of their\r\nhospitalities. Two soldiers, who had deserted from the army in Boston,\r\nfinding their way to Rumford (Concord), had been employed by him upon\r\nhis farm. Wishing to return to their ranks and comrades, they had sought\r\nfor the intervention of their employer to secure them immunity from\r\npunishment. Thompson addressed a few lines for this purpose to General\r\nGage asking at the same time that his own agency in their behalf should\r\nnot be disclosed. Besides his acquaintance with the royal governors, the\r\npatronage he had received from one of them, the intimacy in which he was\r\nsupposed to stand with others, the return of the deserters, and his\r\nindependent spirit, as shown in speaking his mind with freedom, in a\r\nway to check the rising spirit of rebellion, and in distrust of the\r\nability and success of the disunionists, caused him to be distrusted,\r\nand unpopular by the inflammable materials around him. He therefore\r\nbecame a suspected person in Rumford, where there were watching enemies,\r\nand talebearers, as well as jealous committees, who soon brought their\r\nfunctions to bear in a most searching and offensive way against all who\r\ndid not attend revolutionary assemblies. It was well known as it was\r\nobservable that Thompson took no part in these. He had occasion to fear\r\nany indignity which an excited and reckless county mob, directed by\r\nsecret instigators might see fit to inflict upon him, whether it were by\r\narraying him in tar and feathers, or by riding him upon a rail to be\r\njeered at by his former school-pupils. If ill usage stopped short of\r\nthese extremes, the condition of escape and security was a public\r\nrecantation, unequivocally and strongly expressed, involving a\r\nconfession of some act, or word, in opposition to the will of the\r\ndisunionists, and solemn pledge of future uncompromising fidelity to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThere was something exceedingly humiliating and degrading to a man of\r\nindependent and self-respecting spirit, in the conditions imposed upon\r\nhim by the \"Sons of Despotism\" in the process of clearing himself from\r\nthe taint of \"Loyalism.\" The Committees of \"Correspondence and of\r\nSafety\" whose services stand glorified to us through their most\r\nefficient agency in a successful struggle, delegated their authority to\r\nevery witness or agent who might be a self-constituted guardian of the\r\ndisloyal cause or a spy, or an eaves-dropper, to catch reports of\r\nsuspected persons. It was this example, followed a few years later that\r\nled to such terrible results in the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nMajor Thompson insisted from the first, and steadfastly to the close of\r\nhis life, affirmed that he had never done anything hostile to the\r\nrevolutionary cause up to this time. He demanded first in private, and\r\nthen in public, that his enemies should confront him with any charges\r\nthey could bring against him, and he promised to meet them and defend\r\nhimself against all accusations. He resolved, however, that he would not\r\nplead except against explicit charges, nor invite indignity by\r\nself-humiliation. Major Thompson was summoned before a Committee of the\r\npeople of Rumford (Concord), in the summer of 1774 to answer to the\r\nsuspicion of \"being unfriendly to the cause of Liberty.\" He positively\r\ndenied the charge and boldly challenged proof. The evidence, if any such\r\nwas offered, was not a sort to warrant any proceedings against him, and\r\nhe was discharged. This discharge, however, though nominally an\r\nacquittal, was not effectual in relieving him from popular distrust and\r\nin assuring for him confidence. Probably his own reluctance to avow\r\nsympathy with the disloyal cause, and make professions in accordance\r\nwith the wishes of his enemies, left him still under a cloud. A measure\r\nless formal and more threatening than the examination before a self\r\nconstituted tribunal, was secretly planned by the \"Sons of Despotism.\"\r\nThis was a visit to his comfortable home, the most conspicuous\r\nresidence in the village. It was carried into effect in November, 1774.\r\nA mob gathered at the time agreed on, around his dwelling, and after a\r\nserenade of hisses, hootings and groans, demanded that Major Thompson\r\nshould come out before them. The feeling must have been intense and was\r\nof a nature to feed its own flames. Had Thompson been within, he would\r\ninevitably have met with foul handling. The suspicion that he was hiding\r\nthere would have led to the sacking of his dwelling, and the destruction\r\nof his goods, though the daughter of their venerated minister was its\r\nmistress, and she was the mother, not only of Thompson's infant, but of\r\nthe only child of their former distinguished townsman, Colonel Benjamin\r\nRolfe. Mrs. Thompson and her brother, Colonel Walker, came forth and\r\nwith their assurance that her husband was not in town, the mob\r\ndispersed.\r\n\r\nHaving received a friendly warning that this assault was to be made upon\r\nhim, his brother-in-law and other friends advised him to quit the place,\r\nfor although his family connections, beginning with the minister, and\r\nthe squire of the town, were, the most powerful set among the\r\ninhabitants, yet they were unable to vindicate him and protect him from\r\noutrage, and we may infer that his apprehensions were not in vain,\r\nnotwithstanding his own consciousness of rectitude.\r\n\r\nMr. Thompson therefore had secretly left Rumford just before the mob\r\ncame to his home. He thought it was to be only a temporary separation\r\nfrom the place, for all his friends were there, and his wife and infant\r\nchild; but he was never to see that pleasant home again, nor anyone of\r\nthose whom he left there, except that he had a brief and troubled visit\r\nfrom his wife and infant, and met the latter again only after an\r\ninterval of twenty-two years. He made a hasty effort to collect some\r\ndues which belonged strictly to himself, but he scrupulously avoided\r\ntaking with him anything that belonged to others, or even to his wife.\r\nWhat of his own he left there was soon subjected to the process of\r\nconfiscation.\r\n\r\nThompson sought refuge in his former home at Woburn with his mother.\r\nHere for a short time, he sought to occupy himself in quiet retirement\r\nwith his favorite pursuits of philosophical study and experiment. But\r\npopular suspicion found means to visit its odium upon him there, and\r\nseeking a new refuge, he found temporary shelter in Charlestown, with a\r\nfriend, nine miles from Woburn and one from Boston. In compliance with\r\nan earnest appeal, his wife with her infant joined him at his mother's\r\nhome in Woburn, though it required of them a ride of more than fifty\r\nmiles in winter. They remained with him till the end of May, 1775, after\r\nwhich he never saw his wife again. Thompson offered his services to the\r\npatriot army but his enemies interposed their veto. Ellis says, \"There\r\nis no record, or even tradition of unwise or unfriendly expressions\r\ndropped by Mr. Thompson which could be used against him even when he\r\nchallenged proof of his alleged disaffection to the cause of his\r\ncountry. However he was young and he had an independent spirit. His\r\nmilitary promotion by pure favoritism, and, what he insisted was simply\r\nan act of humanity, his seeking immunity for two returning deserters,\r\nwere enough in themselves to assure him zealous enemies.\"\r\n\r\nThrough all this trouble Thompson had a staunch and loyal friend.\r\nColonel L. Baldwin was an ardent patriot, but stood faithfully by his\r\nold friend and fellow-student, believed in him and protected him from\r\nviolence. At last Thompson's pride was so wounded and he felt the\r\nhumiliation so keenly that in the hot impulse of youth and a naturally\r\nproud spirit, he embraced an opportunity to leave a land which he\r\nhonestly thought to be ungrateful and cruel. It is not true as has often\r\nbeen said that Benjamin Thompson lost his interest in his family and\r\ncountry. Some of the most tender and most touching letters were written\r\nby him to his mother and his family still in Concord who believed in his\r\nintegrity. Some of these letters have never been published, others after\r\nthe lapse of nearly a century appeared in the \"life of Count Rumford\" by\r\nDr. Ellis. These errors as to matters of fact may persuade us that the\r\nearly predilection of Thompson for the loyalist cause, and the opening\r\nof opportunities, more than any settled purpose, decided the course of\r\nthis forlorn and ill-treated young husband and father, adrift on the\r\nworld, when he found himself loosed from all home ties and that there\r\nwas nothing secret or disguised in the plans he formed for seeking in a\r\nforeign land and among strangers at the risk of homelessness and\r\npoverty, the peace and protection which he could not find in his own\r\ndwelling. He did not privately steal away; he remained in and about\r\nWoburn two months after writing his last letter to his friend, Mr.\r\nWalker, in which he so deliberately avowed his intentions. He settled\r\nhis affairs with his neighbors, collecting dues and paying debts, well\r\nassured that his wife and child would lack none of the means of a\r\ncomfortable support. Having made all his preparations he started from\r\nWoburn October 13, 1775, in a country vehicle, accompanied by his\r\nstep-brother, Josiah Pierce, who drove him to the shores of Narragansett\r\nBay where he was taken aboard of the British frigate Scarborough, in the\r\nharbor of Newport. The vessel very soon came round to Boston and\r\nremained till the evacuation, of which event he was undoubtedly the\r\nbearer of the tidings to England in despatches from General Howe. From\r\nhenceforth we are to know Benjamin Thompson till the close of the war as\r\nan ardent loyalist, and in council and in arms an opponent to the\r\nrevolutionary cause. He must have done appreciable service in the four\r\nor five months he was in Boston, in order to have won so soon the place\r\nof an official in the British government. Thenceforward the rustic youth\r\nbecame the companion of gentlemen of wealth, and culture, of scientific\r\nphilosophers, of the nobility and of princes. The kind of influences\r\nwhich he at once began to exert, and the promotion which he so soon\r\nreceived in England, answers to a class of services rendered by him of a\r\nnature not to be misconceived. They had not in England at that time much\r\nexact information about the state of the country. Thompson thoroughly\r\nunderstood the matter. He could give trustworthy information about the\r\ntopography, and about the events of the war in which he had played a\r\npart. He was not slow in winning the confidence of Lord George Germaine,\r\nSecretary of State for the Colonies, who was sadly deficient in his\r\nknowledge of the American Colonies. Major Thompson was immediately\r\nadmitted to a desk in the Colonial office. He of course proffered and\r\nshowed he could impart \"information.\" The young man became such a\r\nfavorite with Lord George that he was daily in the habit of\r\nbreakfasting, dining and supping with him at his lodgings and at his\r\ncountry seat, Stoneland. Apart from the discharge of his duties as a\r\nprivate secretary, he made the most and the best use of his\r\nopportunities in acquainting himself with London and seeking\r\nintroductions alike to men in public station and to those engaged in\r\nscientific pursuits; nothing of interest would escape his keen\r\nobservation, and no means of personal improvement or acquisition through\r\nmen or things, would fail to yield him advancement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR BENJAMIN THOMPSON.\r\n\r\nBorn in North Woburn, March 26, 1753. In the uniform of a British\r\nOfficer. Known as Count Rumford. Died at Paris Aug. 21, 1814.]\r\n\r\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and became one of the most\r\nactive and honored members of the Society. In 1780 he was made \"Under\r\nSecretary of State for the Northern Department.\" The oversight of all\r\nthe practical details for recruiting, equipping, transporting, and\r\nvictualling the British forces, and of many other incidental\r\narrangements was then committed to him. Major Thompson, who had always\r\nclung to that title, though its provisional commission gave him no rank\r\nin the regular army, was now honored with the commission in the regular\r\narmy of a Lieutenant Colonel; though now at the age of only\r\ntwenty-eight, not yet a veteran, he wished for, and meant to do, full\r\nmilitary duty. He needed a command. Where should he find a regiment. He\r\nprovided for himself, and resolved to secure a following from those in\r\nhis native land, who had been loyal to the government. They were known\r\nas the \"Loyal American Regiments\" and for the most part, they were the\r\nmost desperate, and hated of any of the combatants, they had suffered\r\nthe loss of their homes, and endured the most cruel treatment from their\r\nneighbors, and countrymen, and when the opportunity occurred they often\r\nretaliated. In this partisan warfare quarter was neither given or taken.\r\nIn the early part of January, 1782, Lieutenant Colonel Thompson arrived\r\nat Charleston, South Carolina, General Green's army at that time\r\ninvested the city. Becoming desperate in their need of supplies, a\r\nsortie was made under Thompson's command, an attack was made by him on\r\nthe partisan forces under the command of Marion, the famous partisan\r\nleader, near the Santee. When the brigade was first attacked it was\r\nunder the command of Colonel Horrey, and though Marion came in season to\r\ntake part in the action, he had the mortification of witnessing the\r\ndiscomfiture of his band with the loss of many men and munition.[187]\r\n\r\n  [187] Memoir of the war in the Southern Department of the United States.\r\n  By Henry Lee, p. 397.\r\n\r\nRivington's New York Gazette, under date of Feb. 18th, 1782, says \"A\r\ndetachment of the Royal Americans went on service against Greene,\" March\r\n27th. A person who left the Southern Army Feb. 13th, says Lieutenant\r\nColonel Thompson has taken command of the British cavalry under Colonel\r\nLeslie. \"A considerable force of cavalry and infantry commanded by\r\nColonel Thompson sallied out from Charleston on the side opposite the\r\nAmerican camp and surprised and dispersed a party of militia. The\r\nBritish retreated before Greene could send reinforcements.\"\r\n\r\nCharleston, March 2. Lieutenant Colonel Thompson moved Sunday, Feb. 24\r\nfrom Daniel's Island, with the cavalry, Cunningham's and Young's troops\r\nof mounted militia, Yagers, and Volunteers of Ireland, with one three\r\npounder, and a detachment of the Thirtieth Regiment. By the spirited\r\nexertion of his troops, and by the Colonel's mounting the infantry\r\noccasionally on the dragoon horses, he carried his corps thirty-six\r\nmiles without halting. Having secured the American scouts to prevent\r\ninformation being given he drove in Horrey's regiment. They were pursued\r\nby Major Doyle with mounted militia. On seeing the enemy, Colonel\r\nThompson sounded a charge and dashed forwards. Marion's marque and men\r\nrefreshed our soldiers. Colonel Thompson marched back driving the\r\ncattle, etc. The admirable conduct of the officer who commanded can be\r\nequalled by the spirit with which his orders were executed. (Rivington,\r\nApril 17). In the war of posts, of desultory skirmishes, and of raids\r\ninto the farming country, to which the struggle at the South was\r\nreduced, there was indeed little opportunity for Thompson to win\r\nlaurels. He made use of his energetic and methodical skill in doing what\r\nhe could to organize and discipline such materials as he had before him.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the war he was sent to New York to organize a\r\nregiment out of the broken and scattered bands of Loyalists on Long\r\nIsland. \"Recruits for the King's American Dragoons, likely and spirited\r\nyoung lads who were desirous of serving their King and country, and who\r\nprefer riding to going on foot, were offered ten guineas each, if\r\nvolunteers.\" Such was the advertisement. His ability in organizing this\r\nregiment was a great achievement. He commanded at Huntington, Long\r\nIsland in 1782-3 where he caused a fort to be built. In August, 1782,\r\nnear Flushing, standards were presented to his corps, with imposing\r\nceremonies. Prince William came forward to the center of the regiment,\r\nreceived the colors from Admiral Digby, and presented them with his own\r\nhand to Lieutenant Colonel Thompson. On a given signal the whole\r\nregiment gave three shouts, the music played \"God save the King\", the\r\nartillery fired a royal salute and the ceremony ended.\r\n\r\nAn ox was roasted whole, to grace this occasion. He was spitted on a\r\nhickory sapling, twelve feet long, supported on crutches, and turned by\r\nhandspikes. An attendant dipped a swab in a tub of salt and water to\r\nbaste the ox, and moderate the fire. Each soldier then sliced off for\r\nhimself a piece of juicy beef.[188]\r\n\r\n  [188] The barbecue is still in vogue in the Southern States at all large\r\n  social gatherings.\r\n\r\nThe Prince who officiated on this occasion was the King's third son,\r\nafterwards William IV. He had sailed on board the Prince George under\r\nAdmiral Digby, to qualify himself for rank in the Royal Navy.\r\n\r\nReturning to England Thompson, as a commissioned officer of high rank\r\nnow on half pay, obtained leave to travel on the Continent. He left\r\nEngland in September, 1783, with no anticipation of the ultimate result\r\nof what was to him in intent mainly a trial of fortune. On his arrival\r\nat Strasburg, Prince Maximilian, who became Elector of Bavaria in 1799\r\nand King in 1805, was attracted by the young man's appearance. On\r\nacquaintance he soon realized that the Englishman was a man of\r\nremarkable intelligence and later Thompson received an earnest\r\ninvitation to enter into the service of the elector. Thompson therefore\r\nreturned to England to receive the necessary permission from the king.\r\nThe king not only granted the permission but also conferred on him the\r\nhonor of Knighthood on February 23, 1784.\r\n\r\nReturning to the continent Thompson became a fast friend of the Elector\r\nof Bavaria. His great mind was put to useful service in a country that\r\nneeded his wisdom, philanthropy and personal help. Many honors were\r\nconferred upon him and he was admitted to several academies. In 1788 the\r\nElector made him Major-General of Cavalry and Privy Councillor of State.\r\nHe was also put at the head of the War Department. His constant study in\r\nscience and philosophy, and the great problems of the day, made him an\r\ninvaluable help to the people, besides his ability as a statesman. In\r\nMunich, where beggary had been reduced to a system and had become an\r\nintolerable curse, he received from all classes multiplied tokens of\r\nmost grateful regard for his acts of disinterested benevolence. Both in\r\nEngland and on the continent he was held in the highest esteem for the\r\nbroad and wise plans for the amelioration of the condition of the poor\r\nwhich he devised and executed. He dealt with those who lived in the\r\nfilthiest order and it was his aim to show them that virtue came from\r\ncleanliness, and he worked unceasingly that their surroundings might\r\nfirst be clean.\r\n\r\nHonors of all kinds were heaped upon this worker for mankind, but\r\nnothing so deeply moved him or was so tenderly cherished in his memory,\r\nas that scene, when once he was dangerously ill, the poor of Munich went\r\npublicly in a body, in processions, to the cathedral, and offered public\r\nprayers for his recovery. And on another occasion four years later, when\r\nhe was again dangerously ill at Naples, these people of their own\r\naccord, set apart an hour each evening, after they had finished their\r\nwork in the Military Work-house, to pray for him. On his return, after\r\nan absence of fifteen months, the subjects of his benevolence gave him a\r\nmost affecting reception. He in response, provided for them a festival\r\nin the English Gardens which his own skill and taste had laid out where\r\nbefore was an unhealthy marsh. Here eighteen hundred poor people of all\r\nages enjoyed themselves, in presence of above eighty thousand visitors.\r\nThompson says, \"Let him imagine, I say, my feelings, upon hearing the\r\nconfused noise of the prayers of a multitude of people who were passing\r\nby in the streets, upon being told that it was the poor of Munich, many\r\nhundreds in number, who were going in procession to the church to put up\r\npublic prayers for me;--public prayers for me!--for a private person!--a\r\nstranger!--a Protestant!\"\r\n\r\n\"Such testimonies as these were more valuable than all his military\r\nhonors, all his scientific reputation, his diplomas of Knighthood in\r\nEngland, and in Poland, and his decoration as a count of the Holy Roman\r\nEmpire and there is reason to believe that he so regarded them\r\nhimself.\"[189]\r\n\r\n  [189] Memorial of James Thompson of Charlestown, Mass., and Woburn,\r\n  Mass., by Leander Thompson, A. M.\r\n\r\nHe was accused of being selfish and devoid of all honor, coarse and\r\ncruel. That he married another woman while his wife was alive and was\r\nalways a tyrant! The records of Concord give the date of his wife's\r\ndeath as January 19, 1792, while the register of Paris gives the date of\r\nhis second marriage as October 24, 1805.\r\n\r\nSarah, the only child of Count Rumford, who was born in the Rolfe\r\nMansion in Concord, Oct. 18, 1774, remained in the care of her mother\r\nuntil the latter's death. Her father had taken great interest in her and\r\nnever forgot his family, and he made provision also for his mother.\r\nAfter his wife's death, Sarah accepted her father's invitation to rejoin\r\nhim in Europe where she shared his honors both in London and on the\r\nContinent. She received her title as countess and her pension both of\r\nwhich she enjoyed to the close of her life.\r\n\r\nWhile the countess was on a return visit to her old home she gained the\r\nfirst news of her father's coming marriage through his letters to her.\r\nFather and daughter kept up a continual correspondence, and from these\r\nletters which have since been published much of their private life is\r\nrevealed.[190] Count Rumford married the widow of General Anthony\r\nLaurence Lavosier at Paris in 1805, but the marriage soon proved unhappy\r\nand he retired to the Villa Auteuil, within the walls, but removed from\r\nthe noise of the great city. Count Rumford never returned to his old\r\nhome in Massachusetts though it was his wish to do so. The United States\r\ngovernment through its ambassador, Hon. Rufus King, then resident of\r\nLondon, formally invited him to return, assured of his loyalty and great\r\nability, and offered him the responsible position of superintendent of\r\nthe proposed American Military Academy and of inspector-general of\r\nartillery. Though to the mutual regret of both parties concerned, the\r\ncount was not able to accept the invitation of the American government,\r\nhe gave in order to assist in the equipment of the Military Academy,\r\nsome of his very valuable models and drawings and offered to give his\r\nwhole rich collection of military books, plans, drawings, and models,\r\nprovided they would be acceptable.\r\n\r\n  [190] See \"Life of Count Rumford,\" by George Ellis.\r\n\r\nThe Count's last days were spent near Paris, as that climate was best\r\nsuited to him. He lived a very retired life spending most of his days in\r\nphilosophical pursuits and experiments, almost secluded from the world.\r\nConstant friendship between Colonel Baldwin and Benjamin Thompson\r\nremained until the end, and the latter was always grateful for the\r\ninterest and care his old friend had bestowed upon his daughter during\r\ntheir separation.\r\n\r\nThompson published essays and papers on his work and that he could have\r\nbeen great in theoretical science is shown by his experiment at Munich\r\nin 1798, and his clear reasoning upon it which was in advance of the\r\nprevailing scientific opinion by half a century. When he was in London\r\nin 1800 he projected the Royal Institute of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nBesides a great number of communications to scientific journals, he\r\npublished four volumes of essays, political, economical, experimental,\r\nand philosophical. He was ever a great friend to Harvard College. When\r\nthe Colleges were converted into barracks, during the siege of Boston,\r\nhe was instrumental in preserving the library and philosophical\r\napparatus from destruction by the revolutionists who regarded the\r\nCollege as a hotbed of toryism. By his will he laid the foundation of\r\nthat professorship to Harvard University, which has rendered his name\r\njustly esteemed with his friends. He bequeathed an annuity of one\r\nthousand dollars and the reversion of another of four hundred dollars,\r\nalso the reversion of his whole estate, which amounted to twenty-six\r\nthousand dollars, \"for the purpose of founding a new institution and\r\nprofessorship, in order to teach by regular courses of academical and\r\npublic lectures accompanied with proper experiments, the utility of the\r\nphysical and mathematical science for the improvement of the useful\r\narts, and for the extension of the industry, prosperity, happiness and\r\nwell being of society.\" In 1796 he remitted five thousand dollars in\r\nthree per cent. stocks, to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,\r\nthe income to be appropriated as a premium to the author of the most\r\nimportant discovery on light and heat.\r\n\r\nThis great, useful and influential life came to a close on August 21,\r\n1814. He was just about to depart for England to which country, as long\r\nas he lived, he retained the most devoted attachment. His death resulted\r\nfrom a nervous fever at Auteuil, about four miles from Paris and he is\r\nburied within the limits of that city. In the Monthly Magazine or\r\nBritish Register (London) for September, 1814, appeared the following:\r\n\r\n\"At his seat near Paris, 60, died, August 21, that illustrious\r\nphilosopher, Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, F. R. S., Member of the\r\nInstitute, &c., an American by birth, but the friend of man, and an\r\nhonor to the whole human race.\"\r\n\r\nMany testimonies were given in remembrance of Benjamin Thompson\r\nthroughout the civilized world. In Munich the king erected at his own\r\ncost a bronze statue of Count Rumford, and it stands in the Maximillian\r\nStrasse, the finest street of Munich, perhaps of any city of Europe. The\r\nnew and beautiful library which was erected in Woburn, Massachusetts,\r\nhas paid tribute also to this man's memory. A bronze monument of heroic\r\nsize stands boldly out upon the library lawn, and the inscription was\r\nwritten by President Eliot of Harvard College. The Rumford Historical\r\nAssociation was organized in 1877 with the simple desire to do justice\r\nto Count Rumford's transcendent abilities as a great scientist and to\r\nhis marked usefulness as one of the greatest philanthropists of his age.\r\nA portrait of Count Rumford by Page after one Kellerhofer hangs in\r\nMemorial Hall, Cambridge.\r\n\r\nSarah, the Countess of Rumford, after living in Paris and London several\r\nyears, returned to her old home in Concord, where she spent her last\r\nyears. She possessed many memorials and pictures which she was fond of\r\nexhibiting to visitors. She was eccentric but had a quick and vigorous\r\nmind and idolized America. She was never married and her death occurred\r\nDecember 2, 1852, at the age of seventy. In her will she left $15,000\r\nand her homestead, worth $5,000, for the endowment of an institution for\r\nwidows and orphans of Concord, the homestead to be the site of the\r\ninstitution, to the New Hampshire Asylum for Insane in Concord she left\r\n$15,000, to the Concord Female Charitable Society who have under their\r\ncare a school for poor children, called the Rumford School, she left\r\n$2,000, and the rest of her property, estimated at from $75,000 to\r\n$100,000, to distant relatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   COLONEL RICHARD SALTONSTALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancestors of Sir Richard Saltonstall resided for centuries in the\r\nparish of Halifax, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England, and the\r\nearliest date at which we find this name recorded is in 1276. Thomas de\r\nSaltonstall of the West Riding of Yorkshire is the first name of whom\r\nany record is preserved. Sir Richard Saltonstall, born in 1521 was\r\nknighted by Queen Elizabeth in 1598. After holding several prominent\r\noffices under the crown he became Lord Mayor of London in 1597-8. He was\r\nthe uncle of Sir Richard Saltonstall who was born in 1586 at Halifax and\r\nwas one of the patentees of the Colony of the Massachusetts Bay and was\r\nappointed First Assistant. He came over with the Winthrop fleet, and\r\narrived in Salem aboard of the Arabella, June 12, 1630, \"bringing out\r\nthe charter with them.\" He returned to England, and at his death, left a\r\nlegacy to Harvard College. He dissented from the action of the\r\ntyrannical rulers who were his associates, who inflicted punishment on\r\nsuch as differed from them, but slightly in their notion of policy, and\r\nrequested that his dissent should be entered upon the records, which\r\nstand much to his honor and credit. After his return to England he wrote\r\nto Mr. Cotton and Mr. Wilson, the ministers in Boston \"that it did not a\r\nlittle grieve his spirit to hear what sad things were reported daily of\r\nthe tyranny and persecution in New England, as that they fined, whipped\r\nand imprisoned men for their consciences.\" His son Richard, born in\r\n1610, settled at Ipswich, Massachusetts, returned to England, and died\r\nthere in 1694. His son Nathaniel, born about 1639 and died in 1707,\r\nsettled at Haverhill, Mass., of which he is called the father. He\r\nmarried Elizabeth, the daughter of the first minister, Rev. John Ward,\r\nwho gave the young couple the land for their home, on which was erected\r\nthe Saltonstall mansion which remained in the possession of the\r\nSaltonstall family for several generations. In the early part of the\r\nlast century it was purchased by Major James Duncan, who erected the\r\npresent mansion which is now owned and occupied by the Haverhill\r\nHistorical Society. Nathaniel had a son Richard, who also had a son\r\nRichard born June 24, 1703. He graduated from Harvard College in 1722\r\nand became Colonel in 1726. In 1736 he became judge of the Superior\r\nCourt and died in 1756. His eldest son, Richard Saltonstall, the subject\r\nof this notice, was the sixth generation from Sir Richard the First\r\nAssistant, and the fourth of the family in succession who held the\r\noffice of Colonel. He graduated from Harvard College with high honors\r\nand delivered the Latin Oration at Commencement.\r\n\r\nHis acceptance from Governor Shirley of the commission of Colonel, so\r\nsoon after leaving college, evinced a spirit which was not long after to\r\nbe tried in arduous service for his country. During the French war he\r\nwas Major in the army and was one of the unfortunate prisoners at the\r\ncapitulation of Fort William Henry. He escaped being massacred by the\r\nIndians by concealing himself in the woods where he lay for many hours,\r\nand when at last he reached Fort Edward was nearly exhausted with\r\nfatigue and hunger. He remained in active service until the close of the\r\nwar, and later was appointed Sheriff to the County of Essex.\r\n\r\nColonel Saltonstall was always a steady loyalist in principle and never\r\nfor a moment wavered in his devotion to the flag which he had so bravely\r\nfought under and which he had so often sworn to support. \"The\r\nproceedings (of the Government) were in his opinion extremely\r\ninexpedient, but he never doubted their right to tax the Colonies.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was much beloved by the people of Haverhill, and its vicinity. He\r\nresided on the beautiful family estate in Haverhill known as 'the\r\nSaltonstall Place,' where he lived in a liberal style of hospitality,\r\nsustaining the character of a truly upright man, and an accomplished\r\ngentleman. It was long before he lost his popularity, but in 1774 a mob\r\nassembled from the West Parish of Haverhill and Salem, N. H., for the\r\npurpose of proving themselves _Sons of Liberty_ by attacking him. By a\r\nword he could have collected a great part of the inhabitants of the\r\nvillage to his defence, but he would not, though urged by some of his\r\nfriends. The rioters marched to his home and paraded before it, armed\r\nwith clubs and other offensive instruments, when he came to the door and\r\naddressed them with great firmness and dignity. He told them he was\r\nunder the oath of allegiance to the king, that he was bound to discharge\r\nthe duties of the office he held under him, that he did not think the\r\npeople were pursuing a wise or prudent course but that he was as great a\r\nfriend to the country as any of them, and had exposed his life in its\r\ncause, etc. He then ordered some refreshment for the _gentlemen_, who\r\nsoon began to relent, when he requested them to go to the tavern and\r\ncall for entertainment at his expense. They then huzzard to the praise\r\nof Colonel Saltonstall, and never attempted to mob him again.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Saltonstall left Haverhill in the fall of 1774 and embarked for\r\nEngland. He did not enter the British service, saying, if he could not\r\nconscientiously engage on the side of his native country he never would\r\ntake up arms against her. If he had joined the continental army he\r\nundoubtedly would have held an office of high command. The king granted\r\nhim a pension and he passed the remainder of his life in England, where\r\nhe died. In one of his last letters in which he expressed great\r\naffection for the \"_delightful place of his nativity_,\" he wrote, \"I\r\nhave no remorse of conscience for my past conduct. I have had more\r\nsatisfaction in a private life here than I should have had in being next\r\nin command to General Washington, where I must have acted in conformity\r\nto the dictates of others, regardless of my own feelings.\"\r\n\r\nIn Haverhill Colonel Saltonstall was much beloved and had a great\r\ninfluence from his integrity, benevolence of disposition and his\r\nsuperior understanding and knowledge of the world. In England he was\r\nhospitably received by his remote family connections, who paid him every\r\nkind and generous attention while living, and erected a monument to his\r\nmemory in Kensington church, on which is the following inscription:\r\n\r\n\"Near this place are interred the remains of Richard Saltonstall, Esq.,\r\nwho died October, 1785, aged fifty-two. He was an _American loyalist_,\r\nfrom Haverhill in Massachusetts, where he was descended from a first\r\nfamily, both for the principal share it had in the early erecting as\r\nwell as in rank and authority in governing that province, and wherein he\r\nhimself sustained, with unshaken loyalty and universal applause, various\r\nimportant trusts and commands under the Crown both civil and military,\r\nfrom his youth till its revolt; and throughout life maintained such an\r\namiable private character, as engaged him the esteem and regard of many\r\nfriends. As a memorial of his merits this stone is erected.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Saltonstall was not married. He was Proscribed and Banished by\r\nthe law of 1778. His mansion home at Haverhill passed into the hands of\r\nhis brother, Dr. Nathaniel Saltonstall who joined the Disunionists, at a\r\ntime when his brothers remained true to those principals of loyalty in\r\nwhich they had been educated. He however did not take up arms against\r\nthe government. At his death he left three sons and four daughters, the\r\nonly family of that name in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nLEVERETT SALTONSTALL, youngest son of Judge Saltonstall was born in 1754\r\nand at the commencement of the war had nearly completed his term of\r\nservice with a merchant of Boston, when Col. Saltonstall came to that\r\nplace for protection from mob violence. Being in the habit of looking\r\nup to him for advice and direction, he embraced the same political\r\nopinion, and becoming acquainted with the British officers he was\r\nfascinated with their profession. After the passing of the Act of\r\nDisunion July 4, 1776 he unlike his brothers decided to enter the\r\nBritish service and fight for his government. He was in many battles,\r\nand commanded a company in the army of Lord Cornwallis. He died at the\r\nclose of the war at New York, 1782. His brother-in-law, the Rev. Moses\r\nBadger, who was also a loyalist, in a letter to Dr. Nathaniel\r\nSaltonstall concerning his sickness (consumption), says, \"It may be some\r\nconsolation to you and his mother to hear, that his behaviour in the\r\nregiment endeared him to every officer, and the soldiers who had so\r\nfrequent opportunities to see his intrepidity, coolness and gallantry in\r\naction, absolutely revered him. He was agreeable to people of all ranks.\r\nHe was exceedingly cautious in speaking, seldom uttering a word without\r\nreflection and was never heard to speak ill of any one and reprobated\r\nthe man or woman who indulged themselves in this infirmity. He never\r\nfell into the scandalous and fashionable vice of profaneness. In short,\r\nI looked upon him to be as innocent a young man as any I have known\r\nsince I have been capable of making observations on mankind.\"[191]\r\n\r\n  [191] Mass. His. Coll. 2, series Vol. IV, pp. 167, 168.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          REV. MATHER BYLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nJosiah Byles, a saddler by trade, came from Winchester, Hants county. He\r\nwas in Boston in 1695 and joined the church October 11, 1696; seven\r\nyears later he married the pastor's daughter.\r\n\r\nHe had four children by his wife Sarah. His second wife, Elizabeth, he\r\nmarried October 6, 1703; she was the widow of William Greenough and the\r\ndaughter of Increase Mather.\r\n\r\nMather Byles, D. D., son of Josiah and Elizabeth, was born in Boston in\r\n1706. He graduated from Harvard University in 1725 and was ordained\r\nfirst pastor of the Hollis street church in 1733. This church was built\r\non land given by Governor Belcher in 1733, the site is now occupied by\r\nthe Hollis street Theatre. He married, February 14, 1733, Mrs. Anna\r\nGale; the ceremony took place in the state room of the Province House,\r\nRev. Thomas Prince of the Old South officiating. By this marriage he had\r\nsix children born, all of whom died young except Elizabeth. His second\r\nwife was Rebecca, daughter of Lieutenant Governor Hon. William Tailor;\r\nthe ceremony was performed by Rev. Joseph Sewell, D. D. By his second\r\nwife he had four children. He was created Doctor of Divinity at Aberdeen\r\nin 1765. He lived happily with his parish until 1776 when the connection\r\nwas dissolved and never renewed. Of the Congregational clergy he stood\r\nalone against the revolution.\r\n\r\nMather Byles is one of the most interesting men of this period. He was a\r\nscholar and a great wit. Pope, Lansdowne and Watts were among his\r\ncorrespondents. In his pulpit he avoided politics and on being asked the\r\nreason, replied: \"I have thrown up four breastworks, behind which I have\r\nentrenched myself, neither of which can be enforced. In the first place\r\nI do not understand politics; in the second place, you all do, every man\r\nand mother's son of you; in the third place you have politics all the\r\nweek, pray let one day in seven be devoted to religion; in the fourth\r\nplace, I am engaged in work of infinitely greater importance; give me\r\nany subject to preach on of more consequence than the truth I bring you,\r\nand I will preach on it the next Sabbath.\"\r\n\r\nThe preacher became known as the \"celebrated Dr. Byles.\" He wrote in\r\npoetry and prose very well, and some of his sermons are still extant.\r\nAlso several of his essays, in the New England Weekly Journal, a poem on\r\nthe death of George I; and the accession of George II, in 1727. A sort\r\nof memorial address to Governor Belcher, on the death of his wife, and a\r\npoem called the conflagration, and a volume of metrical matters\r\npublished in 1744.\r\n\r\nThe serious writings of Dr. Byles are singularly free from everything\r\nsuggestive of frivolous association. In his pulpit there was none of it,\r\nwhile out of it, unless on solemn occasions, there was very little else.\r\nOne of that day said his wit at times was quite as clever as Jonathan\r\nSwift or Sydney Smith.\r\n\r\nMather Byles and his family were staunch loyalists. News of the repeal\r\nof the stamp act arrived in Boston May 16, 1766. The nineteenth of May\r\nwas appointed for merry-making. \"At one in the morning the bell of the\r\nHollis street church began to ring,\" says a zealous writer of that day.\r\n\"The slumbers of the pastor, Dr. Byles, were disturbed of course, for he\r\nwas a tory, though a very pleasant tory, after all.\" In 1777 he was\r\ndenounced in town meeting, and having been by a subsequent trial\r\npronounced guilty of attachment to the Royal cause, was sentenced to\r\nconfinement, and to be sent to England with his family. This Byles\r\nsteadfastly refused to do and the doom of the banishment was never\r\nenforced, and he was permitted to remain in Boston. The substances of\r\nthe charges against him were that he continued in Boston during the\r\nsiege; and that he prayed for the king and the safety of the town.\r\n\r\nFor a time he was kept a prisoner in his own house. On one occasion\r\nwhile under guard he persuaded the sentinel to go on an errand for him,\r\npromising to perform sentinel's duty himself; and to the great amusement\r\nof all gravely marched before his own door with a musket on his\r\nshoulder, until his keeper returned. This was after his trial; and\r\nalluding to the circumstances that he had been kept prisoner, that his\r\nguard had been removed and replaced again, he said, that \"he had been\r\nguarded, re-guarded, and disregarded.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REV. MATHER BYLES, D. D.\r\n\r\nBorn in Boston in 1706. \"A man of infinite wit.\" Died in Boston July 5,\r\n1788.]\r\n\r\nNear his house, in wet weather, was a very bad slough. It happened that\r\ntwo of the selectmen who had the care of the streets, passed that way\r\ndriving in a chaise, stuck fast in this hole, and were obliged to get\r\nout in the mud to extricate their vehicle. Dr. Byles came out, and\r\nmaking them a respectful bow, said: \"Gentlemen, I have often\r\ncomplained to you of this nuisance, without any attention being paid to\r\nit, and I am very glad to see you 'stirring' in this matter now.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Byles' wit created many a laugh and many an enemy. In person he was\r\ntall and commanding. His voice was strong and harmonious and his\r\ndelivery graceful. He was intimate with General Knox, who was a\r\nbookseller before the war. When the American troops took possession of\r\nthe town after the evacuation, Knox, who had become quite corpulent,\r\nmarched in at the head of his artillery. As he passed on Byles thought\r\nhimself privileged, on old scores, exclaimed, loud enough to be heard,\r\n\"I never saw an ox fatter in my life.\" When confined in his own house\r\nand quite poor and had no money to waste on follies, he caused the\r\nlittle room in which he read and wrote to be painted brown, that he\r\nmight say to every visitor, \"You see, I am in a brown study.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the stamp act in 1765 to the period of the revolution\r\nthe cry had been repeated in every form of phraseology, \"that our\r\ngrievances should be redressed.\" One fine morning the multitude had\r\ngathered on the common to see a regiment of redcoats parade there, who\r\nhad recently arrived. \"Well,\" said the doctor, gazing at the spectacle,\r\n\"I think we can no longer complain that our grievances are not\r\nred-dressed.\" \"True,\" said one of his neighbors who were standing near,\r\n\"but you have two d's, Dr. Byles.\" \"To be sure, sir, I have,\" the doctor\r\ninstantly replied, \"I had them from Aberdeen in 1765.\"\r\n\r\nSome visitors called one morning, and Mrs. Byles unwilling to be found\r\nat her ironing board, and desiring to hide herself, as she would not be\r\nso caught by those ladies, the doctor put her in a closet, and buttoned\r\nher in. After a few remarks the ladies expressed a wish to see the\r\ndoctor's curiosities, which he proceeded to exhibit; and after\r\nentertaining them very agreeably for some time, he told them he had kept\r\nthe greatest curiosity to the last; and proceeding to the closet,\r\nunbuttoned the door and exhibited Mrs. Byles.\r\n\r\nHe had at one time a remarkably stupid and literal Irish girl as a\r\ndomestic. With a look and voice of terror he said to her in haste, \"Go\r\nand say to your mistress, Dr. Byles has put an end to himself.\" The girl\r\nran upstairs and with a face of horror, screamed, \"Dr. Byles has put an\r\nend to himself.\" The astonished wife and daughter ran into the\r\nparlor--and there was the doctor, calmly waltzing about with a part of a\r\ncow's tail, that he had picked up in the street, tied to his coat or\r\ncassock behind.\r\n\r\nOn the celebrated Dark-day in 1780 a lady who lived near the doctor,\r\nsent her young son with her compliments, to know if he could account for\r\nthe uncommon appearance. His answer was, \"My dear, you will give my\r\ncompliments to your mamma, and tell her that I am as much in the _dark_\r\nas she is.\" He paid his addresses unsuccessfully to a lady who\r\nafterwards married a gentleman of the name of Quincy; the doctor on\r\nmeeting her said: \"So madam, it appears that you prefer a Quincy to\r\nByles.\" \"Yes, for if there had been anything worse than _biles_ God\r\nwould have afflicted Job with them.\"\r\n\r\nMather Byles had two daughters by his second wife, Mary born in 1750 and\r\nKatherine born in 1753. They were famous for their hospitality and their\r\nstout, unflinching loyalty to the throne, to the last hours of their\r\nexistence. This thread of life was spun out more than half a century\r\nafter the Royal government had ceased in these States; yet they retained\r\ntheir love of, and strict adherence to monarch and monarchies, and\r\nrefused to acknowledge that the Revolution had transferred their\r\nallegiance to new rulers. One of these ladies of a by-gone age, wrote to\r\nWilliam the Fourth, on his accession to the throne. They had known the\r\n\"sailor-king\" during the Revolution and now assured him that the family\r\nof Doctor Byles always had been, and would continue to be, loyal to the\r\nrightful sovereign of England.\r\n\r\nDr. Byles continued to live in Boston after the Revolution, the last\r\ntwelve years of his life being spent in retirement. He died of paralysis\r\nJuly 5th, 1788 at the age of 82. As Dr. Byles refused to be driven out\r\nand made a refugee, or absentee, he therefore saved his property from\r\nconfiscation, and his two daughters, maiden ladies, lived and died in\r\nthe old family house at the corner of Tremont and Nassau street, now\r\nCommon street. They were repeatedly offered a great price for their\r\ndwelling, but would not sell it, nor would they permit improvements or\r\nalterations. In the course of improvements in Boston a part of the\r\nbuilding had to be removed in widening the street. This had a fatal\r\ninfluence upon the elder sister; she mourned over the sacrilege, and, it\r\nis thought, died its victim. \"That,\" said the survivor, \"is one of the\r\nconsequences of living in a Republic. Had we been living under a king,\r\nhe would have cared nothing about our little property, and we could have\r\nenjoyed it in our own way as long as we lived. But,\" continued she,\r\n\"there is one comfort, that not a creature in the States will be any\r\nbetter for what we shall leave behind us.\" She was true to her promise,\r\nfor the Byles estate passed to relatives in Halifax at their decease.\r\nOne of them died in 1835, the other in 1837. They worshipped in Trinity\r\nchurch under which their bodies were buried, and on Sundays wore dresses\r\nalmost as old as themselves. Among their furniture, was a pair of\r\nbellows two centuries old, a table on which Franklin drank tea on his\r\nlast visit to Boston, a chair which more than a hundred years before the\r\nGovernment of England had sent as a present to their grandfather,\r\nLieutenant-Governor Tailer. They showed to visitors commissions to their\r\ngrandfather, signed by Queen Anne, and three of the Georges. They talked\r\nof their walks arm-in-arm, on Boston Common, with General Howe, and Lord\r\nPercy, while the British Army occupied Boston. They told of his\r\nLordship's ordering his band to play under their window for their\r\ngratification. They took pleasure in exhibiting the many heirlooms which\r\nwere in the possession of the family and enjoyed hearing a recitation of\r\nthe bright stories of the day. The works of Watts were sent to Byles by\r\nthe author from time to time and among the treasures highly prized by\r\nthe family was a presentation copy, in quarto from Pope, of his\r\ntranslation of the Odyssey. At the sale of the library of Dr. Byles a\r\nlarge folio Bible in French, was purchased by a private individual. This\r\nBible had been presented to the French-Protestant church in Boston, by\r\nQueen Anne, and at the time when it came into the hands of Dr. Byles was\r\nthe last relic of that church, whose visible temple had been erected in\r\nSchool Street about 1716.[192]\r\n\r\n  [192] For further information about these French Protestants see the\r\n  \"Memoir\" by Dr. Holmes, or to Vol. XXII. p. 62. of Massachusetts\r\n  Historical Collections.\r\n\r\nThe bible is now preserved in the library of the Divinity School at\r\nCambridge and was presented in 1831 by the widow of the late Samuel Cobb\r\nof Boston, who had bought it at the sale of Mather Byle's library.\r\n\r\nMATHER BYLES, JR., D. D., a son of Rev. Mather Byles by his second wife,\r\nwas born in 1734, and married Rebecca, daughter of Rev. N. Walter of\r\nRoxbury in 1761. He graduated in 1751 at Harvard University. In 1757 at\r\nthe age of twenty-three he was ordained at New London; his father\r\npreached the sermon. Eleven years after, his ministry came to an abrupt\r\ntermination. Without previous intimation, he called a meeting of his\r\nchurch and requested dismission, that he might accept an invitation to\r\nbecome Rector of the North Episcopal, or Christ Church, Salem street,\r\nBoston. His change to Episcopacy was soon a matter of discussion all\r\nover New England. Among the reasons he gave in the course of the\r\ndiscussion that ensued, were, that \"another minister would do much\r\nbetter for them than he had done or could do, for his health was infirm,\r\nand the position of the church very bleak, the hill wearisome, he was\r\nnot a country minister, and his home and friends were all in Boston.\"\r\nThe debate was long and warm, and produced total alienation. April 12,\r\n1768, the record is \"The Rev. Byles dismissed _himself_ from the church\r\nand congregation.\" Before the close of 1768, he was inducted into the\r\ndesired rectorship; and of Christ Church, was the third in succession.\r\nHe continued to discharge his ministerial duties until 1775, when the\r\nforce of events compelled him to abandon his flock. He was a staunch\r\nloyalist, and resigned the rectorship of Christ Church on Easter\r\nTuesday, 1775, meaning to go to Portsmouth, in New Hampshire, but\r\npolitical tumults there, making that impossible, he remained in Boston,\r\nand performed the duty of chaplain to some of the regiments, until the\r\nevacuation in 1776, when he left Boston. Accompanied by his family of\r\nfour persons, he went to Halifax. In 1778 he was proscribed and\r\nbanished. He settled at St. John, New Brunswick, after the war, and was\r\nRector of the city, and Chaplain of the Province. He died at St. John in\r\n1814.\r\n\r\nHis daughter Rebecca, born in 1762, married W. J. Almon, M. D., Surgeon\r\nto the Ordnance and Artillery, and died at Halifax in 1853.\r\n\r\nMATHER BYLES (3) born in 1764, went to the British West Indies, was\r\nCommissary General at Grenada. He married June, 1799, Mary, eldest\r\ndaughter of Chief Justice Bridgewater of Grenada. The writer was at St.\r\nGeorge, Grenada, in 1907, and saw there in the Episcopal Church a\r\nmarble tablet erected to the memory of Mather Byles of Boston, by his\r\nBrother Belcher. He died Dec. 17, 1802.\r\n\r\nELIZABETH, born in 1767, married William Scoville, Esq., of St. John,\r\nand died in 1808.\r\n\r\nANNA, born at Boston, married General Thomas DesBrisay, Lieut. General\r\nin the Army, Commandant at Halifax in 1799.\r\n\r\nBELCHER was born in 1780 at Halifax, and died in England in 1815.\r\n\r\nMATHER BROWN, was a grandson of Rev. Mather Byles (1). His mother was\r\nElizabeth, born in 1737, who married in 1760 Gawler Brown and died in\r\n1763.\r\n\r\nMather Brown went to Europe in 1780, with a letter of introduction from\r\nhis grandfather to Harrison Gray, Esq., London, a firm friend of the\r\nfamily. Mr. Copley had likewise been intimate with Dr. Byles before he\r\nleft Boston. He also gave him a letter addressed by the old patriarch\r\n\"To Mr. Copley in the Solar system.\" In a letter dated Paris 23, 1781,\r\nhe writes: \"Dr. Franklin has given me a pass, and recommendatory letter\r\nto the famous Mr. West. He treats me with the utmost politeness; has\r\ngiven me an invitation to his home. I delivered him my grandfather's\r\nmessage, he expressed himself with the greatest esteem and affection for\r\nhim, and has since introduced me at Versailles, as being grandson to one\r\nof his most particular friends in America.\"\r\n\r\nIn his first letter from London, 1781, he writes: \"In consequence of the\r\nrecommendation of Dr. Franklin, who gave me letters to his fellow\r\ntownsman, the famous Mr. West of Philadelphia, I practice gratis with\r\nthis gentleman, who affords me every encouragement, as well as Mr.\r\nCopley, who is particularly kind to me, welcomed me to his home, and\r\nlent me his pictures, etc. At my arrival Mr. Treasurer Gray carried me\r\nand introduced me to Lord George Germaine.\" In a letter in 1783 he\r\nwrote: \"I have exhibited four pictures in the exhibition; the king and\r\nqueen were there yesterday.\" In 1784: \"I have painted several Americans.\r\nYesterday I had two pictures shown his royal highness, the Prince of\r\nWales. They were carried to the palace by his page. He criticised them,\r\nand thought them strong likenesses. I believe I never told you that the\r\nking knew a picture of mine in the last exhibition, of the keeper of\r\nWindsor Castle, and took particular notice of Mr. Gray's picture; asked\r\nhim who it was, and who did it, and what book he had in his hand. Mr.\r\nWest told him it was the treasurer of Boston painted by his pupil, a\r\nyoung man, Mr. Brown of America. The king asked him what part. He told\r\nhim Massachusetts.\" In 1785 he writes: \"Among other great people I have\r\npainted, Sir William Pepperell and family, and Hon. John Adams,\r\nambassador to His Britannic Majesty. On the 20th of June, I had the\r\nhonor to be introduced to the Duke of Northumberland at his palace; his\r\nGrace received me with the utmost politeness.\"\r\n\r\nMather Brown became afterwards artist to the king, a worthy successor to\r\nCopley. And thus two Boston-born boys filled this honorable position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE HALLOWELL FAMILY OF BOSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert Hallowell arrived in Boston from London, in 1764 and entered upon\r\nhis duties as Comptroller of the Customs. He was Collector of the\r\nCustoms at Portsmouth, New Hampshire before the age of twenty-five. In\r\n1765, Sabine says, \"A mob surrounded his elegant house in Hanover\r\nStreet, tore down his fences, broke his windows, and forcing the doors\r\nat last destroyed furniture, stole money, scattered books and papers,\r\nand drank of the wines in the cellar to drunkenness.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1768 Hallowell ordered Hancock's vessel, the _Liberty_, seized for\r\nsmuggling wine, to be removed from the wharf to a place covered by the\r\nguns of the _Romney_ frigate; and in the affray which occurred, received\r\nwounds and bruises that at the time seemed fatal.\r\n\r\nHe removed his office to Plymouth, June 1, 1774, when the port of Boston\r\nwas closed. In 1775, he was an Addresser of Gage; and the year following\r\nwith his family of five persons, he accompanied the British Army to\r\nHalifax. In 1778 he was proscribed and banished. He went to England and\r\nresided at Bristol. Hallowell came to the United States in 1788 and in\r\n1790--as the executor of his own father and of his wife's father. In\r\n1792 he removed to Boston with his family, and lived in the homestead on\r\nBatterymarch Street, which because of his mother's life interest, had\r\nnot been confiscated. He was kindly received and became intimate with\r\nsome distinguished citizens.\r\n\r\nIn 1816, when failing in health, he went to Gardiner, Maine to reside\r\nwith his son, and died there April, 1818, in his seventy-ninth year. His\r\nwife was Hannah, daughter of Doctor Sylvester Gardiner. His two\r\ndaughters, Hannah and Anne, died unmarried. His son, the Hon. Robert\r\nHallowell, became a gentleman of great wealth and a highly respected\r\ncitizen. Two of Mr. Hallowell's sisters died in England; Sarah, wife of\r\nSamuel Vaughan, in 1809; and Anne, widow of General Gould, in 1812.\r\n\r\nThe towns of Hallowell and Gardiner on the Kennebec River are named\r\nafter their families.\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN HALLOWELL of Boston, brother of Robert Hallowell, was\r\nCommissioner of the Customs. In early life he commanded a small armed\r\nvessel, and during the war ending in the conquest of Canada, commanded\r\nthe province twenty-gun ship, \"King George,\" rendering essential service\r\nnotably at the retaking of Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hallowell's acceptance of the office of Mandamus Councillor made\r\nhim a special object of public detestation.\r\n\r\nOn September 2, 1774, while the mob were assembled on Cambridge Common\r\nto receive the resignations of Danforth, Lee, and Oliver as Mandamus\r\nCouncillors, Hallowell passed on his way to Roxbury. About one hundred\r\nand sixty horsemen pursued him at full gallop. Some of the leaders\r\nhowever, prudently dissuaded them from proceeding and they returned and\r\ndismounted, except for one man who followed Hallowell to Roxbury and\r\ncaused him much annoyance. Through the action of the mob he was obliged\r\nto seek protection in Boston and leave his mansion which was built in\r\n1738. It was used afterwards by the disunion forces as a hospital for\r\nthe camp at Roxbury and his pleasure grounds were converted into a place\r\nof burial for the soldiers who died there.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1776, Captain Hallowell accompanied the British army to\r\nHalifax with his family of six persons. In July, 1776, he sailed for\r\nEngland in the ship Aston Hall. While at Halifax he wrote: \"If I can be\r\nof the least service to either army or navy I will stay in America until\r\nthe Rebellion is subdued.\"\r\n\r\nThe British Government granted him lands in Manchester, and two other\r\ntowns in Nova Scotia, and a township in Upper Canada, which bears his\r\nname. He was a large proprietor of lands on the Kennebec, Maine, prior\r\nto the Revolution, but in 1778, he was proscribed and banished and\r\nincluded in the Conspiracy Act a year later, and his entire estate\r\nconfiscated. His mansion house in Roxbury was seized and sold by the\r\nState, but as the fee was in Mrs. Hallowell, her heirs sued to recover\r\nof the person who held under the deed of the Commission of Confiscation\r\nand obtained judgement in 1803 in the United States Circuit Court, by\r\nwhich she recovered the property.\r\n\r\nIn 1784, when Mrs. Adams, the wife of the first minister from the United\r\nStates was in England, she relates that both Mr. Hallowell and his wife\r\ntreated her with respect and kindness. They also urged her to take\r\nlodgings with them, but this she declined. She records, too, that they\r\nlived in handsome style but not as splendidly as when in Boston. She\r\naccepted an invitation to \"an unceremonious family dinner\" as Mrs.\r\nHallowell called it and met the Rev. Dr. Walter, Rector of Trinity\r\nChurch, and two other gentlemen who belonged to Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nOn visiting Boston in 1796, Captain Hallowell was accompanied by his\r\ndaughter, Mrs. Emsley, whose husband had just been appointed Chief\r\nJustice of Upper Canada. During his stay the odium which attached to his\r\nofficial relations to the Crown seemed to have been forgotten, since he\r\nwas received by his former associates with the greatest kindness and\r\nhospitality. He died at York (Toronto) Upper Canada, in 1799, aged\r\nseventy-five, and was the last survivor of the Board of Commissioners.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hallowell had two sons, both of whom changed their names. WARD\r\nNICHOLAS HALLOWELL'S name was changed to Boylston. He was born in Boston\r\nin 1749. Sabine says: \"I have before me the original license bearing the\r\nsignature of George III by which he was authorized to change his name;\"\r\nit recites--\"That Nicholas Boylston, his uncle by his mother's side has\r\nconceived a very great affection for him, the petitioner, and has\r\npromised to leave him at his death, certain estates which are very\r\nconsiderable, etc.\" In early life he made a tour of Europe, visiting\r\nItaly, Turkey, Syria, Palestine, Egypt and along the coast of Barbary;\r\nand arrived in England in 1775 through France, and Flanders. He dined\r\nat Governor Hutchinson's, London, with some fellow Loyalists, July 29,\r\n1775, and entertained the company with an account of his travels, and,\r\nat subsequent periods, exhibited the curiosities which he brought from\r\nthe Holy Land, Egypt, and other countries to the unhappy exiles from his\r\nnative state.\r\n\r\nIn the Autumn of the next year, he was in lodgings at Shepton Mallet. He\r\nbecame a member of the Loyalist Association, formed in London in 1799.\r\nIn 1800 he returned to Boston and laid claim to his father's estate that\r\nhad been confiscated and sold, as being the property of his mother in\r\nher own right. Having assumed her name of Boylston, he obtained the\r\nestate by due process of law, as previously stated. In 1810 he presented\r\nHarvard College with a valuable collection of medical and anatomical\r\nworks and engravings. He took his mother's name of Boylston, and thus\r\nclaimed the family estate. He died at his seat in Roxbury, January 7,\r\n1828.\r\n\r\nHe was a gentleman of education and took an active interest in the\r\nRoxbury schools. His liberality is commemorated by a school, and a\r\nstreet named after him, Boylston street being one of the principal\r\nstreets in Boston.\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN HALLOWELL (Carew), another son of Captain Hallowell, who,\r\nsucceeding to the estates of the Carews of Beddington, assumed the name\r\nand arms of that family. He was one of the eight Boston boys who\r\nsubsequently attained high rank in the British service. Admiral Sir\r\nIsaac Coffin, Sir Benjamin Hallowell (Carew), John Singleton Copley, the\r\nyounger, who became Lord Lyndhurst, Lord Chancellor of England, General\r\nSir John Coffin, Hugh Mackay Gordon, Sir David Ochterlony, Sir Roger\r\nHale Sheaff, Sir Aston Coffin.\r\n\r\nEntering the royal navy during the American war he was at the time of\r\nhis death in 1834, an admiral of the Blue in the British Navy, G. C. B.,\r\nK. St. F. M. His commission as Lieutenant, bears date August, 1781; as\r\nCaptain, in 1793; as Rear-Admiral, in 1811; as Vice-Admiral, in 1819. He\r\nwas made a Knight Commander of the Bath in 1819, and was promoted to the\r\nrank of Grand Cross in 1831.\r\n\r\nHis employments at sea were various and arduous. He was with Rodney in\r\nthe memorable battle with De Grasse; also at the siege of Bastia; and in\r\ncommand of a ship-of-the-line under Hotham, in the encounter with the\r\nFrench off the Hieres Islands. He served as a volunteer on board the\r\n_Victory_, in the battle of Cape St. Vincent. In the battle, Admiral\r\nJarvis took his official post on the quarter deck of the Victory.\r\nCalder, the captain of the fleet kept bringing reports of the increasing\r\nnumbers, observed till he reached twenty-seven, and said something of\r\nthe disparity. Enough of that, said Jarvis, the die is cast and if there\r\nare fifty sail, I will go through them. Hallowell could not contain\r\nhimself. He slapped the great admiral on the back, crying \"That's right,\r\nSir John, and by God, we'll give them a damned good licking.\" He was in\r\ncommand of the _Swiftsure_ of seventy-four guns, and contributed\r\nessentially to Nelson's victory in the battle of the Nile. From a part\r\nof the mainmast of L'Orient, which was picked up by the _Swiftsure_,\r\nHallowell directed his carpenter to make a coffin, which was sent to\r\nNelson with the following letter:\r\n\r\n    \"Sir, I have taken the liberty of presenting you a coffin made from\r\n    the mainmast of L'Orient, that when you have finished your military\r\n    career in this world, you may be buried in one of your trophies. But\r\n    that that period may be far distant is the earnest wish of your\r\n    sincere friend,\r\n\r\n                                                  BENJAMIN HALLOWELL.\"\r\n\r\nSouthey, in his \"Life of Nelson,\" remarks: \"An offering so strange and\r\nyet so suited to the occasion, was received in the spirit in which it\r\nwas sent. And, as if he felt it good for him, now that he was at the\r\nsummit of his wishes, to have death before his eyes, he ordered the\r\ncoffin to be placed upright in his cabin. An old favorite servant\r\nentreated him so earnestly to let it be removed, that at length he\r\nconsented to have the coffin carried below; but he gave strict orders\r\nthat it should be safely stowed, and reserved for the purpose for which\r\nits brave and worthy donor had designed it.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1799, Sir Benjamin was engaged in the attacks on the castles of St.\r\nElmo and Capua, and was honored with the Neapolitan Order of St.\r\nFerdinand and Merit. Two years later he fell in with the French\r\nsquadron, and surrendered his ship--the Swiftsure--after a sharp\r\ncontest. During the peace of Amiens, he was stationed on the coast of\r\nAfrica. He was with Hood in the reduction of St. Lucia and Tobago; with\r\nNelson in the West Indies; in command of the convoy of the second\r\nexpedition to Egypt; with Martin, off the mouth of the Rhone, where he\r\nassisted in driving on shore several French ships-of-war; and in the\r\nMediterranean. His last duty seems to have been performed on the Irish\r\nstation. He died at Beddington Park, in 1834, at the age of\r\nseventy-three. His wife was a daughter of Commissioner Inglefield, of\r\nGibraltar Dock-yard. His son and heir, Charles Hallowell Carew who at\r\nthe time of his decease, had attained the rank of Captain in the Royal\r\nNavy, and who married Mary, the daughter of Sir Murray Maxwell, C. B.,\r\ndied at the Park, in 1848. In 1851 his fifth son, Robert Hallowell\r\nCarew, late captain in the 36th Regiment, married Ann Roycroft, widow of\r\nWalter Tyson Smythes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF CONFISCATED ESTATES BELONGING TO BENJAMIN HALLOWELL IN SUFFOLK\r\n                      COUNTY, AND TO WHOM SOLD.\r\n\r\n     To Samuel Gardner Jarvis, July 24, 1780: Lib. 131, fol. 230 Farm, 7\r\n       1-2 A., and dwelling-house in Roxbury, Jamaica Plain N.W.; road by\r\n       widow Parker's N.E.; Joseph Williams S.E.; heirs of Capt.

Samuel was one of the\r\noriginal patentees of lands in Massachusetts in 1628. His monument in\r\nKing's Chapel, Boston, erected by Florentinus Vassall, his great\r\ngrandson, in 1766, sets forth that he was \"a steady and undaunted\r\nasserter of the liberties of England in 1628, he was the first who\r\nboldly refused to submit to the tax of tonnage and poundage, an\r\nunconstitutional claim of the crown arbitrarily imposed for which to the\r\nruin of his family, his goods were seized and his person imprisoned by\r\nthe star chamber court, the Parliament in July, 1641, voted him\r\nL10,445:12:2 for his damages, and resolved that he should be further\r\nconsidered for his personal sufferings.\"\r\n\r\nHis name headed the subscription list to raise money against the rebels\r\nin Ireland, and his whole life was indicative of the energy and\r\nliberality which characterized many of his descendants.\r\n\r\nHis son, WILLIAM VASSALL, born about 1590, was the first of his name who\r\ncame to America. He was an assistant in the Massachusetts Bay Company\r\nand one of the original patentees of New England. In June, 1635, he\r\nembarked with his wife and six children on board the Blessing, for New\r\nEngland. He undoubtedly settled at first in Roxbury, for in the church\r\nrecord of that town is the following entry: \"Mrs. Anna Vassaile, the\r\nwife of Mr. William Vassaile. Her husband brought five children to this\r\nland, Judith, Frances, John, Margaret, Mary.\" Also one other, Anne, who\r\nafterwards married Nicolas Ware.\r\n\r\nWilliam Vassall removed later to Scituate, where he proved himself to be\r\nan ever staunch Episcopalian. The Puritans had strong suspicion of him\r\nalways as \"inclining to the Bishops.\" While he lived in Scituate he was\r\nregarded as a highly respectable citizen and of \"a busy and factious\r\nspirit.\" He was proprietor of a large estate, which bore the name of\r\nNewland. In 1646 he sailed to England for the redress of wrongs in the\r\ngovernment and never returned, but in 1648 removed to Barbados and\r\nresided in the parish of St. Michael, where he died in 1655, aged 65\r\nyears. He bequeathed to his son John one-third of his real estate and\r\nthe remainder to his five daughters. His Scituate estate consisted of\r\nabout 120 acres, with house, barns, and the privilege of \"making an\r\noyster bed in North River,\" before his house. The estate was conveyed by\r\nJoshua Hubbard to John Cushen and Mathyas Briggs for L120.\r\n\r\nHis daughter Judith married Resolved White, the eldest brother of\r\nPeregrine White, at Scituate, 1640. Frances married James Adams at\r\nMarshfield 1646. Ann married Nicholas Ware of Virginia. Margaret married\r\nJoshua Hubbard of Scituate. Mary was unmarried and alive at Barbados in\r\n1655.\r\n\r\nJOHN VASSALL, only son of William Vassall, born about 1625. In 1643 his\r\nname is on the militia roll of Scituate, and later bore the rank of\r\ncaptain. In 1652 he sold his house in Boston for L59. In 1661 he sold\r\nhis Scituate estates and removed, it is supposed, to Cape Fear, N. C,\r\nand later to the West Indies.\r\n\r\nJOHN VASSALL, the only son of Samuel, whose monument is in King's\r\nChapel, married Ann, the daughter of John Lewis, an English resident of\r\nGeno. He went to Jamaica shortly after it was taken in 1655, and laid\r\nthe foundation of the great estate which his posterity enjoyed until the\r\nemancipation in 1834. He had two sons, William and Leonard, from whom\r\ndescended all of the name of which there is any subsequent record.\r\n\r\nLEONARD VASSALL, son of said William, was born in Jamaica, 1678, and was\r\ntwice married. His first wife was Ruth Gale, of Jamaica by whom he had\r\nseventeen children. She died in Boston in 1733. His second wife was\r\nwidow Phebe Goss, by whom he had one daughter. He removed to Boston\r\nprevious to 1723. He was early connected with Christ Church. In 1730 he\r\nwas instrumental in founding Trinity church. The original building was\r\nbuilt on land which he had purchased of William Speakman, baker, 1728,\r\nfor L450. The lot covered by the church was bounded by Seven-starr Lane\r\n(Summer street), 86 feet and 169 feet on Bishop's Lane (Hawley street),\r\nand is nearly opposite the estate which he purchased in 1727 of Simeon\r\nStoddard, and where he resided until his death. He had large and\r\nvaluable estates in Braintree and Jamaica.\r\n\r\nJohn and William Vassall, two of Major Leonard's sons, were important\r\nmen in Boston, and added much to the prosperity of the town.\r\n\r\nJOHN VASSALL, the elder brother of William, was born in the West Indies\r\nSept. 7, 1713, and graduated from Harvard college in 1732. In 1734 he\r\nmarried Elizabeth, the daughter of Lieut. Gov. Spencer Phips by whom he\r\nhad four children, and later he married Lucy, the daughter of Jonathan\r\nBarren of Chelmsford by whom he had one child. He resided in Cambridge\r\nmost of his life and died there November 27, 1747. December 30, 1741,\r\nJohn Vassall conveyed to his brother Henry (a planter who had married\r\nPenelope the daughter of Isaac Royal of Antigua), in consideration of\r\nL9050 over seven acres of land in Cambridge, with dwelling house, barn\r\nand outhouses. During the Revolution, no doubt, this house was the\r\nheadquarters of the Surgeon-General and perhaps a hospital. Dr. Benjamin\r\nChurch, after he was detected in correspondence with the enemy, was\r\narrested here and confined to his quarters until trial, and left a\r\nrecord of his occupation of the house by his name, cut with a penknife\r\non one of the doors of his chamber, which is still legible though since\r\ncovered with several coats of paint.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of John Vassall, his son, who was also known by the\r\nname of John, erected the house in Cambridge, which has since become\r\nfamous through Washington's connection with it, as during the Revolution\r\nit was used as his headquarters, and afterwards it was the home of Prof.\r\nHenry W. Longfellow.\r\n\r\nMAJOR JOHN VASSALL, the grandson of Leonard Vassall, was born in\r\nCambridge, June 12, 1738, and graduated from Harvard College in 1757. He\r\nerected a beautiful edifice on the estate inherited from his father and\r\noccupied it until driven from it by the rage of the mob. The estate was\r\nconfiscated in 1774 and he removed to Boston for protection, and in that\r\ncity continued to dwell upon the estate adjoining that of his uncle,\r\nWilliam Vassall, on Pemberton Hill, until 1776.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the Revolution he was obliged to flee with his\r\nfamily to England. He had large possessions in Cambridge, Boston and\r\nDorchester,[193] all of which were confiscated and himself exiled, soon\r\nafter he departed from home. He joined the British army in Halifax, and\r\nfrom there sailed to England. He died there suddenly, October 2, 1796.\r\nAn obituary published in the \"Gentleman's Magazine\" said of him, \"he had\r\na very considerable property in America where he lived in princely\r\nstyle.\" Sometime after the disturbances took place, having taken a very\r\nactive part and spared no expense to support the royal cause, he left\r\nhis possessions there to the ravagers, and having fortunately very large\r\nestates in Jamaica, he came with his family to England. He carried his\r\nloyalty so far as not to use the family motto, \"Soepe pro rege, semper\r\npro republica.\"\r\n\r\n  [193] See p. 184 concerning his mansion in Dorchester.\r\n\r\nIn 1774 he had been addresser of Hutchinson and for this great offence\r\nto the mobs, he was driven from his home, his property was confiscated\r\nand he was exiled. During his residence in England, he seems to have\r\nlived near Bristol and died at Clifton. A part of the Jamaica grant was\r\nstill in the family, and his several children inherited a competence.\r\nHis wife Elizabeth, sister of Lieut.-Gov. Thomas Oliver, died at\r\nClifton, in 1807. His children were John, who died at Lyndhurst, in the\r\nyear 1800; Thomas Oliver, who died in England in 1807; Elizabeth; Robert\r\nOliver, who became a member of the Council of Jamaica, and died at\r\nAbington Hall, in that island in 1827; a second Elizabeth, who married a\r\nMr. Lemaistre and died at Cheltenham, in 1856; Leonard and Mary, who\r\nalone was born in England, who married Mr. Archer, and who with her only\r\nchild, deceased, at Clifton, in 1806.\r\n\r\nSPENCER THOMAS VASSALL, son of the aforesaid John Vassall, born at\r\nCambridge, Mass., 1764. Entered the British Army as Ensign at the age of\r\ntwelve years. He rose to the command of the 38th regiment, and was\r\nregarded as one of the bravest officers in the service. He was mortally\r\nwounded at the storming of Monte Video, in 1807. His remains were taken\r\nto England and buried in St. Paul's church, Bristol, where there is a\r\nmonument to his memory. His son, Spencer Lambert Hunter, who died in\r\n1846, was a Knight and a captain in the Royal Navy. His other son,\r\nRawdon John Popham, was a colonel in the Royal Artillery. His youngest\r\ndaughter Catherine married Thomas L. Marchant Saumerez, son of the\r\nadmiral.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM VASSALL, brother of Major John Vassall, was born in Jamaica,\r\nNovember 23, 1715, and graduated at Harvard College in 1733. In 1774 he\r\nwas appointed Mandamus Councillor, but was not sworn. He was also\r\nsheriff of Middlesex County. He owned considerable property, and was the\r\npossessor of a fine estate near Bristol, R. I. He was prominent among\r\nthe Loyalists of Boston, and was singled out early as an enemy to the\r\nRevolutionary cause. He was proscribed and banished and obliged to flee\r\nwith his family to England. Mr. Vassall was for many years connected\r\nwith King's Chapel, Boston, and in 1785 protested by proxy against the\r\nchange in the Liturgy and the unauthorized ordination of James Freeman.\r\n\r\nThe confiscation of his estate gave rise to a singular suit. As the\r\nFederal Constitution was adopted, a State could be sued; and, at Mr.\r\nVassall's instance, proceedings against Massachusetts were commenced in\r\nthe court of the United States; and Hancock, who was governor, was\r\nsummoned as defendant in the case; he however declined to appear, and\r\nsoon after the eleventh amendment to the Constitution put an end to the\r\nright of Loyalists to test the validity of the Confiscation Acts of the\r\nRevolution. Mr. Vassall died at Battersea Rise, England, in 1800, aged\r\neighty-five. He was upright, generous, and loving. Church and society\r\nlost in him an eager, zealous advocate, an upright Christian, of an\r\nhonorable and unblemished reputation. His first wife, Ann Davis, bore\r\nhim Sarah, four named William, two named Fanny, Francis, Lucretia, Henry\r\nand Catherine. His second wife, Margaret Hubbard, was the mother of\r\nMargaret, Ann, Charlotte, Leonard and Nathaniel. Each wife had twins.\r\nNathaniel, the youngest son, a captain in the Royal Navy, died in London\r\nin 1832.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM VASSALL, son of the preceding William Vassall, was born in\r\nBoston in 1753, and graduated at Harvard College in 1771. He was a\r\nLoyalist and went to England. He inherited the bulk of his father's\r\nproperty in the West Indies, which descended to his nephew, Rev. William\r\nVassall, rector of Hardington, England, \"but so burdened and\r\ndeteriorated in consequence of emancipation of the slaves that it was\r\nnot worth anything,\" and that gentleman declined to administer upon it.\r\nHe died at the Weston House, near Totness, December 2, 1843. Ann, his\r\nwidow, died at the same place October 1846, aged seventy-five years.\r\n\r\nFLORENTINUS VASSALL was the son of William Vassall and a\r\ngreat-grandson of Samuel, to whose memory he erected the beautiful\r\nmarble monument in King's Chapel, when he was in Boston in 1766. He was\r\nhere again in 1775 and in that year went to England. He was born in\r\nJamaica, and lived there the greater part of his life. He died in London\r\nin 1778.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLONEL JOHN VASSELL'S MANSION, CAMBRIDGE.\r\n\r\nWashington's headquarters during the siege of Boston afterwards known as\r\nthe Craigle and Longfellow House.]\r\n\r\nOf the immense domain fifteen miles wide on both sides of the Kennebec\r\nRiver, extending from the vicinity of Merry Meeting Bay to the\r\nsoutherly line of the town of Norridgwock, he was the owner of one\r\ntwenty-fourth part. In his will, executed in 1776, he gave to his son\r\nRichard and to Richard's daughter, Elizabeth, life estate in these\r\nlands, and then devised them in entail to his male children. The bequest\r\nproved of little value to either. After the lapse of years the rights of\r\nElizabeth and her son Henry were transferred separately to parties in\r\nBoston, to test the title which was claimed by squatters. Three of them\r\nwere sued in the name of the son. The cases were carried up to the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court, where it was decided that during his\r\nmother's life, he could not maintain an action. After her decease, suit\r\nagainst one settler was renewed, but on intimation by the court that\r\nfifty years' possession was sufficient to presume a grant, or title\r\nwithout consideration, another point, namely, whether the right of the\r\nplaintiff to recover was barred by the statute of limitation. The\r\ndefendant paid a small sum for the land he occupied, and each party his\r\nown costs. Thus in 1851 terminated litigation, which for a long time was\r\nthe subject of great interest on the Kennebec, and elsewhere in Maine.\r\nThis granddaughter Elizabeth was a remarkable woman. Those who knew her\r\nspeak of her as brilliant and witty, as possessed of queenly grace of\r\nmanner, as well informed, of wonderful tact, and of excellent sense. Her\r\nfirst husband was Sir Godfrey Webster, Bart. By this marriage she was\r\nthe mother of Sir Godfrey Vassall Webster, Bart., who died in 1836, of\r\nLieut-Col. Sir Henry Vassall Webster, K. T. S., of the British Army, who\r\ndied in London in 1847, aged 54, and of Harriet, who married Admiral Sir\r\nFleetwood B. Reynolds C. B. K. C. H., who died at Florence in 1849,\r\nleaving an only child, the wife of the son and heir of the Earl of\r\nOxford. Another son, Charles Richard Fox, whose father was Lord Holland,\r\nmarried Mary Fitzclarence, second daughter of King William IV., and who,\r\nin 1845 was a colonel in the army, and aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\nIn 1797 Lady Webster married Lord Holland, who took by sign-manual the\r\nsurname of Vassal which, however, was not assumed by his children. As\r\nLady Holland, she was the mother of three children, who died young, of\r\nHenry Holland, who became at the death of his father, Lord Holland, of\r\nMary Elizabeth, wife of Lord Lilford, and of Georgianna Anne who died in\r\n1819.\r\n\r\nThe friendly feelings of Bonaparte towards Lady Holland, especially\r\nafter the peace of Amiens, is well known, and that in return \"for the\r\nmany acts of kindness, which she had bestowed upon him\" he left her a\r\ngold snuff box which had been presented to him by Pope Pius VI.,\r\ncontaining a card with these words: \"L'Empereur to Lady Holland,\r\ntemoigne de satisfaction et d'estime.\" She died at London, in 1845, aged\r\n75. Among her bequests were the income of an estate, about L1500 per\r\nannum, to Lord John Russell, for his life, and a legacy of L100 to\r\nMacaulay the historian.\r\n\r\n\"The Vassall family has ever been distinguished for enterprise,\r\nmagnanimity, and noble bearing. If some of this name were not only\r\noften, but always, for their king it must be admitted that they made as\r\ngreat sacrifices to loyalty as did their forefathers to liberty.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vassals were connected by marriage and business dealings with the\r\nOlivers and Royalls. All three families had acquired great wealth in the\r\nWest Indies, and although they lost their great possessions in New\r\nEngland, by the Confiscation Act, yet they were much better situated\r\nthan their fellow sufferers as they retained their West Indian estates\r\ntill they, too, became worthless, after the emancipation of the slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n LIST OF CONFISCATED ESTATES BELONGING TO JOHN VASSAL IN SUFFOLK COUNTY\r\n                               AND TO WHOM SOLD.\r\n\r\n     To John Williams, Sept. 25. 1781; Lib. 133, fol. 110; Land 3 1-2\r\n       A., and buildings in Dorchester, the high road S. and W.; Ebenezer\r\n       and Lemuel Clap N.; Zebadiah Williams E.----1-2 A South of the\r\n       above, Mr. Jeffries E.; the high road on the other side.\r\n\r\n     To Isaiah Doane, Jan. 8, 1784; Lib. 141, fol. 2; Land and buildings\r\n       in Boston.

He had a grant of land there known as \"Royall's side\" or\r\n\"Ryall's Neck.\" He married, at Boston or Malden, Phoebe Green. He was in\r\nCasco Bay as early as 1635. His house was built on the south side of\r\nwhat was afterwards known as Royall's River, near its mouth, in North\r\nYarmouth. Here he lived until the troubles with the neighboring Indians,\r\nwhich induced him to remove to Dorchester in 1675, accompanied by his\r\nson William, who was born probably at the Casco settlement in 1640. He\r\nwas a carpenter by occupation, and died in 1724, in the 85th year of his\r\nage, and is buried in the tomb built by his son Isaac in the Dorchester\r\nburying ground.\r\n\r\nIsaac Royall, son of the aforesaid William, born probably at the\r\nsettlement in Casco Bay about 1672. He early settled at Boston, and\r\nengaged in trade, making frequent voyages to Antigua and other West\r\nIndia islands. He married, according to Boston records, on July 1, 1697,\r\nElizabeth, daughter of Asaph Eliot and grandniece of the apostle to the\r\nIndians of that name. His wife was the widow of one Oliver, probably of\r\nDorchester.\r\n\r\nFor a period of forty years Isaac Royall was a resident of Antigua,\r\nalthough his frequent presence in Boston during that time is evinced by\r\nhis signature to conveyances. His name first appears on the Suffolk\r\nrecords in a mortgage deed given by himself and wife on the 24th August,\r\n1697, he then being styled a \"merchant of Boston.\" His trading\r\noperations between 1704 and 1710 with the West Indies, proved the\r\nfoundation of his fortune.\r\n\r\nOn December 26, 1732, he purchased of the heirs of Lieutenant Governor\r\nUsher the estate in Charlestown (Medford) containing about five hundred\r\nacres. The large Mansion house was built by Usher, but has since become\r\nwidely known as the Royall Mansion. It was one of the finest and most\r\npretentious residences of the time within the suburbs of Boston. It is\r\ndescribed by a visitor at that time as \"A fine Country Seat belonging to\r\nMr. Isaac Royall, being one of the grandest in N. America.\" This mansion\r\nwas greatly added to, and almost rebuilt by the wealthy West Indian\r\nplanter. He petitioned the General Court in December, 1737, that he\r\nmight not be taxed on the twenty-seven slaves which he brought with him\r\nfrom Antigua. \"That he removed from Antigua with his family, and brought\r\nwith him among other things, and chattels, a parcel of negroes, designed\r\nfor his own use, and not any of them for merchandise.\"\r\n\r\nIsaac Royall, the builder of this mansion, did not live long to enjoy\r\nhis princely estate, dying in 1739, not long after its completion. His\r\nwidow, who survived him eight years, died in this house, and was\r\ninterred from Colonel Oliver's in Dorchester April 25, 1747. The pair\r\nshare the same tomb in the old Dorchester burying place. His daughter\r\nPenelope married Colonel Henry Vassall of Cambridge in 1742. He died in\r\n1769, and she died in Boston in 1800, aged 76.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ISAAC ROYALL, a son, who was born in Antigua, probably in 1719,\r\nmarried Elizabeth McIntosh in 1738, but lived mostly in Boston. He\r\nbecame an extensive purchaser of lands in various parts of the State,\r\nand was one of the original proprietors of the township of Royalston in\r\nWorcester County. He was a member of the Artillery Company of Boston in\r\n1750, was made a brigadier general in 1761, the first of that title\r\namong Americans. He was elected by the House a Councillor of the\r\nProvince, and served in that office until 1774, completing twenty-three\r\nyears of consecutive service.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written of this man's position at the time of the colonial\r\ndisturbances in 1774. Possessed of large wealth, and the influence that\r\nriches and education carried with them, his course was watched by the\r\npeople with intense anxiety. He was known to have much in common with\r\nthe faithful band of Loyalists, who were gathered about Cambridge and\r\nBoston, yet he was still faithful to the people's church, and most of\r\nhis family ties held him to the popular cause. A long letter, written by\r\nhim to Lord Dartmouth, dated in January of 1774, exists in the archives\r\nof the Massachusetts Historical Society's Proceedings, 1873-1875, page\r\n179. Harris says, \"there can be no good reason for doubting the\r\nsincerity of his sympathy with the people, and although, when the time\r\ncame to make a choice, he was prevailed upon to adhere to the side of\r\nthe government, there is abundant evidence of his continued love towards\r\nNew England and his desire to return and end his days here.\" How much\r\nharder was it then for a man in his position to make the great\r\nsacrifices he did, to give up his loved home and his property, all for\r\nthe cause of his King.\r\n\r\nHe wrote to Lord Dartmouth, \"I am conscious that in all public affairs I\r\nhave made the honor of my king and the real Interests and Peace of my\r\ncountry the ultimate end of all my transactions. I am so to live in this\r\nworld as that I may be happy in another, and no man more ardently wishes\r\nand earnestly prays to the God of Peace for the Restoration of those\r\nhappy days, which formerly subsisted between us and our mother country\r\nthan I do.\"\r\n\r\nThree days before the battle of Lexington, Colonel Royall took his\r\ndeparture from Medford. He drove in his chariot, which was one of the\r\nfew in this vicinity, to Boston, and never again returned.\r\n\r\nThe mansion itself was indeed one of the finest of colonial residences,\r\nstanding, as it did, in the midst of elegant surroundings. In the front,\r\nor what is now the west side, was the paved court. Reaching farther west\r\nwere the extensive gardens, opening from the courtyard, a broad path\r\nleading to the summer house. The slave quarters were at the south. The\r\nbrick slave quarters have remained unchanged, and are the last visible\r\nrelics of slavery in New England. The deep fireplace where the slaves\r\nprepared their food is still in place, and the roll of slaves has\r\ncertainly been called in sight of Bunker Hill, though never upon its\r\nsummit.\r\n\r\nThe interior woodwork of the house is beautifully carved, especially the\r\ndrawing room, guest chamber, and staircase. The walls are panelled, and\r\nthe carving on either side of the windows is very fine, that in the\r\nguest chamber being the most elaborate.\r\n\r\nOne interested in colonial architecture may wander for hours through\r\nthis noble house, and yet feel that there is more to learn. The dark\r\ncellar, full of passages, the garret with its corners, and the secret\r\nstaircase so often searched for, yet undiscovered, all furnish good\r\nmaterial for imaginary pictures of the Revolutionary days of our\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\nThe Royall mansion is now owned and occupied by \"The Royall House\r\nAssociation\" and is open for the public.\r\n\r\nWhen Colonel Royall left his mansion he had prepared to take passage\r\nfrom Salem to Antigua, but, having gone into Boston, the Sunday previous\r\nto the battle of Lexington, and remained there until that affair\r\noccurred, he was, by the course of events, shut up in the town. He\r\nsailed for Halifax very soon, still intending, as he says, for Antigua,\r\nbut on the arrival of his son-in-law. George Erving, and his daughter,\r\nwith the troops from Boston, he was by them persuaded to sail for\r\nEngland, whither his other son-in-law, Sir William Pepperell, had\r\npreceded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL ISAAC ROYALL'S MANSION, MEDFORD.\r\n\r\nHe was kind to his slaves, charitable to the poor and friendly to\r\neverybody.]\r\n\r\nUpon his arrival in England, he exchanged visits with Governors Pownall,\r\nBernard, and Hutchinson. Colonel Royall after the loss of some of his\r\nnearest relatives and of his own health, requested that he be allowed to\r\nreturn \"home\" to Medford and to be buried by the side of his wife, his\r\nfather and mother, and the rest of his friends. He would fain have\r\nlived in amity with all men and with his king too, but the Revolution\r\nengulfed him. But he is not forgotten. He died in England 1781, his\r\nlarge hearted benevolence showed itself in many bequests to that country\r\nthat had driven him forth and to which he was an alien. He bequeathed\r\nupwards of two thousand acres of land in Worcester County to found the\r\nfirst Law Professorship of Harvard University and his other bequests\r\nwere numerous and liberal. He has a town (Royalston) in Massachusetts\r\nnamed for him, and is remembered with affection in the place of his\r\nformer abode. His virtues and popularity at first saved his estate, as\r\nhis name was not included with those of his sons-in-law, Sir William\r\nPepperell and George Erving, in the \"conspirators act,\" but on the\r\nrepresentation of the selectmen of Medford \"_that he went voluntarily to\r\nour enemies_\" his property was taken under the confiscation act and\r\nforfeited. It was held by the State until 1805, when it was released by\r\nthe Commonwealth, owing to the large bequests that Colonel Royall made\r\nto the public. It was then purchased by Robert Fletcher, who divided the\r\nestate up into house lots and sold them to various persons.\r\n\r\nGeneral Royall's mansion was the centre of great festivities, and the\r\nmost noted families of Boston and vicinity were entertained there. He\r\nwas noted for his hospitality and was always generous and charitable to\r\nthe poor, and an excellent citizen. Brooks in his \"History of Medford\"\r\nsays hospitality was almost a passion with him. No home in the Colony\r\nwas more open to friends, no gentleman gave better dinners, or drank\r\ncostlier wines. As a master he was kind to his slaves, charitable to the\r\npoor, and friendly to everybody.\r\n\r\nHe was a most accurate man and in his daily journal minutely described\r\nevery visitor, topic, and incident and even descended to recording what\r\nslippers he wore and when he went to bed. Some one said in speaking of\r\nColonel Isaac Royall, \"it is not that he loved the colonies less but\r\nEngland more.\" Among his bequests was a legacy of plate to the first\r\nchurch of Medford, and legacies to the clergymen, and while a member of\r\nthe House of Representatives, he presented the chandelier which adorned\r\nits hall.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of General Royall from his beautiful home, it was\r\ntaken possession of by the rebels who came pouring into the environs of\r\nBoston and laid siege to same. Colonel, afterwards General, John\r\nStark,[194] made the mansion his headquarters, and his New Hampshire\r\ntroops pitched their camp in the adjacent grounds. It was afterwards\r\noccupied by General Lee, who took up his quarters in the mansion, whose\r\nechoing corridors suggested to his fancy the name of Hobgoblin Hall.\r\n\r\n  [194] General John Stark's brother Colonel William Stark, was a man of\r\n  great bravery and hardihood. Before the Revolution he was a much greater\r\n  man than his brother John. He commanded New England troops in the\r\n  capture of Ticonderoga, Crown Point, Louisburg and Quebec. In West's\r\n  picture, \"The Death of Gen. Wolf,\" he is shown as holding Wolf in his\r\n  arms. William Stark remained loyal and became a colonel in the Royal\r\n  Army. He was killed from a fall from his horse at the battle of Long\r\n  Island.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, the wife of Isaac Royall, died at Medford, July, 1770, and\r\nwas buried in the marble tomb in Dorchester. Their daughter Elizabeth,\r\nthe wife of Sir William Pepperell, died at sea upon the voyage to\r\nEngland in 1775.[195]\r\n\r\n  [195] For an account of the Pepperell family see New Eng. Gen. Reg., xx.\r\n  4. Those descended from him comprise probably a hundred families holding\r\n  the highest social positions including dignitaries in church and state,\r\n  baronets, presidents of colleges, D. D's., and bishops, and others of\r\n  exalted rank, perhaps more numerous than can be found in any one family\r\n  in the British realms.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the male line of the Royalls has ceased to exist in\r\nMaine and Massachusetts. The writer knows not of a single living\r\nindividual bearing the surname who has descended from the stock that in\r\nthe beginning of the settlement was so vigorous, and promised to be so\r\nprolific. This statement will also apply to many other Loyalists'\r\nfamilies that were driven from their homes at the commencement of the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           GENERAL WILLIAM BRATTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Brattle, the forefather of the Brattle family that settled in\r\nBoston, was at his death accounted the wealthiest man in the Colony.\r\nThough we have no information concerning the family prior to the coming\r\nof Thomas Brattle to New England, it is only reasonable to believe that\r\nhe was descended from an educated and intelligent line. Only four\r\ngenerations bearing the name existed here, and it is a notable\r\ncircumstance that all the male representatives of those four generations\r\nwere men of remarkable powers and distinguished abilities.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS BRATTLE was born about 1624, and was a merchant of Boston. He was\r\na member of the Artillery Company and captain in the militia, and the\r\ncommander of several expeditions against hostile Indians. He was one of\r\nthe founders of the Old South Church. He married Elizabeth, the daughter\r\nof Captain William Tyng, by whom he had seven children. His death\r\noccurred in 1683.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS BRATTLE, the son of the former, was born in 1658, and was a\r\ngraduate of Harvard College. He was a very intelligent man, and was\r\ntreasurer of Harvard College for twenty-five years. He was one of the\r\nfounders of the Brattle Street church, and gave an organ to the King's\r\nChapel when it was rebuilt in 1710, the first organ used in Boston in a\r\nchurch. He was a steadfast opposer of the proceedings of the courts\r\nduring the witchcraft delusion in 1692. He was a Fellow of the Royal\r\nSociety, and died in 1713. President Ouincy says of him: \"He was\r\ndistinguished for his private benevolences and public usefulness.\"\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BRATTLE graduated from Harvard college, and for over twenty\r\nyears was pastor of the Cambridge church. He was also a member of the\r\nRoyal Society of London.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BRATTLE, son of the former, was baptized by his father in 1706.\r\nHe graduated from Harvard College in 1722, and was a member of the\r\nAncient and Honorable Artillery Company. He was a theologian, and as a\r\nphysician he was widely known, and no higher tribute to his eminence as\r\na barrister need be sought than in the years 1736-7, when, only thirty\r\nyears of age, he was elected by the House and Council to the office of\r\nAttorney General.\r\n\r\nHe possessed strong peculiarities, and Sabine says of him that \"A man of\r\nmost eminent talents and of greater eccentricities has seldom lived.\" He\r\ninherited a large and well invested property, and had ample means to\r\ncultivate those tastes to which, by his nature and education, he was\r\ninclined. He was for many years Major General of the Province, and\r\nafterwards Brigadier General. His large and beautifully situated house,\r\nwhich now exists in Cambridge, though greatly transformed, known as the\r\n\"Old Brattle House\" was the resort of the fashion and style of this\r\nsection of the country. At the age of twenty-one he married Katherine,\r\nthe daughter of Governor Gurdon Saltonstall. She died at Cambridge in\r\n1752, and he married again in 1755, Mrs. Martha, widow of James Allen,\r\nand daughter of Thomas Fitch. General Brattle seems to have inherited\r\nfrom his father the same love for and interest in the welfare of his\r\nAlma Mater, which so characterized the beloved minister of the church in\r\nCambridge. He was long one of her overseers, and in 1762 was appointed\r\nby the Council one of a committee for the erection of Hollis Hall, a\r\ntask which was satisfactorily completed.\r\n\r\nWhen the Revolution broke out in 1775, he was holding a very honorable\r\noffice under the crown. Harris says he was \"on terms of friendship with\r\nmany of the regular army officers quartered in Boston and vicinity. His\r\ncultivated and refined tastes tending always to draw him to court,\r\nrather than plebeian society, were, no doubt, inducements for him to\r\nremain loyal. Certain it was, while studiously endeavoring to preserve\r\nfriendly and peaceful relations with his townsmen and neighbors, he was\r\nopenly opposed to their principles. He was an Addresser of Gen. Gage and\r\napproved of his plans, but at last public excitement reached such a\r\nheight that he deemed it wise to withdraw from Cambridge, and leaving\r\nhis house and property in the hands of his only daughter, Madame\r\nWendell, at that time a widow, he quietly joined the Royal army in\r\nBoston, and at the evacuation in 1776, sailed with the forces to\r\nHalifax, where he died in October of the same year. It is said that his\r\ngravestone is still to be seen in the churchyard in that city.\" There is\r\na portrait of William Brattle in the possession of his descendants,\r\nwhich was painted by Copley, being one of the first productions of that\r\neminent artist. Of his nine children, only two lived to maturity,\r\nKatherine in whom the line but not the name was perpetuated, and Thomas.\r\n\r\nKatherine was married to John Mico Wendell, a merchant of Boston, in\r\n1752, who was of Dutch origin. After the death of her husband, Katherine\r\nremoved to Cambridge and resided there until her death in 1821, at the\r\nage of nearly ninety-one years. The house was situated near the corner\r\nof what afterwards became Wendell street, and North ave. The Centinel\r\nof February 10, 1821, contained a memoir from which we gain some\r\nknowledge of her character.\r\n\r\n\"Descended from honorable families, she possessed the virtues and and\r\nmaintained the honors of her ancestors.... During the war of the\r\nRevolution, both her talents and virtues were put to severe tests, and\r\nby her wisdom and discretion, her energy, and integrity, her\r\nbenevolence, and charity, she conciliated the favor of men in power,\r\ncivil and military; secured to herself personal respect, and rescued the\r\npaternal inheritance from the hazard of confiscation. It was by her\r\nmeans that the portion of the estate that fell to her brother Thomas,\r\nthen in England, was in a like manner preserved.... Her contributions\r\naided in the translation of the Bible into the languages of the East,\r\nand in the diffusion of Christian knowledge among the poor and destitute\r\nof our own country.\"\r\n\r\nShe had five children, but three of them died before reaching maturity.\r\nGovernor James Sullivan, who knew Thomas Brattle well, wrote of him:\r\n\"Major Brattle exercised a deep reverence for the principles of\r\ngovernment, and was a cheerful subject of the laws. He respected men of\r\nscience, as the richest ornament of their country. If he had ambition,\r\nit was to excel in acts of hospitality, benevolence, and charity. The\r\ndazzling splendor of heroes, and the achievements of political\r\nintrigues, passed unnoticed before him, but the character of the man of\r\nbenevolence filled his heart with emotions of sympathy.\"... \"In his\r\ndeath, the sick, the poor and the distressed have lost a liberal\r\nbenefactor, politeness an ornament, and philanthropy one of its most\r\ndiscreet and generous supporters.\"\r\n\r\nTHOMAS BRATTLE, the youngest and only surviving son of General William\r\nand Katherine Saltonstall Brattle, was born at Cambridge in 1742. He\r\ngraduated from Harvard College in 1760, and not long afterwards visited\r\nEngland and the Continent, for the double purpose of study and travel.\r\n\r\nWhen the war broke out, he was still abroad, and being informed of the\r\nposition taken by his father, he conceived to be the most prudent course\r\nto remain in England. While abroad he traveled over various parts of\r\nGreat Britain, and made a tour through Holland and France, and was\r\nnoticed by persons of distinction. Returning to London, he zealously and\r\nsuccessfully labored to ameliorate the condition of his countrymen, who\r\nhad been captured and were in prison. This restored to him his estates,\r\nfor he was included in the Confiscation, Proscription and Banishment Act\r\nof 1778. He returned to America in 1779, and 1784 the enactments against\r\nhim in Massachusetts were repealed, and he took possession of his\r\npatrimony. He found his mansion home at Cambridge had been thoroughly\r\nransacked and damaged by the Continental troops, who had occupied it\r\nduring the war. The neglected estate was restored to its former beauty,\r\nand improved by the erection of a green-house, probably one of the\r\nearliest known in this part of the country. He lived here for many\r\nyears, and became well known for his charities. He died, universally\r\nlamented and beloved, on the seventh of February, 1801, and was laid to\r\nrest in the family tomb, the last of his name. He was never married.\r\n\r\nThe only descendants of General William and Katharine Saltonstall\r\nBrattle, are through their daughter Katherine, who married John Mico\r\nWendell.\r\n\r\n\r\n     CONFISCATED ESTATE OF WILLIAM BRATTLE IN BOSTON, AND TO WHOM SOLD.\r\n\r\n     To James Allen, May 12, 1781; Lib. 132, fol. 202: Land and\r\n       buildings in Boston.

[N.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            JOSEPH THOMPSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph Thompson was the son of Joseph and Sarah (Bradshaw) Thompson, who\r\nwere located in Medford as early as 1772, coming from Woburn, and\r\ndescended from the same family as Sir Benjamin Thompson (Count Rumford).\r\nThey lie buried side by side in the little burial ground on Salem\r\nstreet, Medford. Joseph, the subject of this sketch, was born May 16,\r\n1734. He was married in Boston, 1759, to Rebecca Gallup, whom Isaac\r\nRoyall refers to in his will as a kinswoman of his wife.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the double portion assigned to him out of his father's\r\nestate, he added to it from time to time by the purchase of several\r\nestates. His occupation is mentioned in the deeds as that of merchant.\r\nIn June, 1775, news reached the Provincial Congress that the Ervings of\r\nBoston, had fitted out, under color of chartering to Thompson, a\r\nschooner of their own, to make a voyage to New Providence (Nassau,\r\nBahama Islands), to procure \"fruit, turtle and provisions of other kinds\r\nfor the sustenance and feasting of those troops who are, as pirates and\r\nrobbers, committing daily hostilities and depredations on the good\r\npeople of this colony and all America.\" Congress therefore resolved that\r\nCaptain Samuel McCobb, a member, \"be immediately dispatched to Salem and\r\nMarblehead, to secure said Thompson, and prevent said vessel from going\r\nsaid voyage, and cause the said Thompson to be brought before this\r\nCongress.\" Thompson, however, escaped, and afterwards went to England.\r\nOn June 3, 1780, on the petition of Rebecca Thompson, asking leave be\r\ngranted her to rejoin her husband in England on the first convenient\r\nopportunity, and to also return again to this state, the General Court,\r\nand the committee of Inspection for Medford, were directed to see that\r\nshe carried no letters nor papers that might be detrimental to this, or\r\nany of the United States of America.[196]\r\n\r\n  [196] Medford Historical Register, Vol. viii, p. 59.\r\n\r\nJames Prescott, Joseph Hosmer and Samuel Thatcher, Esq., were ordered\r\nto make sales of certain estates situated in the county of Middlesex,\r\nconfiscated to the use of the government, belonging to Joseph Thompson,\r\nmerchant. Six acres of salt marsh on Medford river were sold to Ebenezer\r\nHall, Jr., for L70; a dwelling house and yard bounded south on the great\r\nroad, to Thomas Patten for L295; 11/2 rods of land (part of the dower\r\nestate of his mother), with 3-16 of the dwelling house, 1-4 of an acre\r\nof mowing land, 20 rods of plow land, to Samuel Kidder for L24.15; a pew\r\nin the meeting house to Susanna Brooks, widow, for L10; 8 acres of land\r\nbounded south on the great road and west on Proprietor's Way, and\r\nsituated near the Hay Market, to Jonathan Foster for L252. 10, and about\r\n10 poles of land with a joiner's shop thereon, bounded north on the road\r\nto Malden, to Ebenezer Hall for L40.5, making a total of L692.5.\r\n\r\nA Mr. Thompson died in England during the war, probably the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       COLONEL JOHN ERVING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Erving family was one of the oldest and most respected families in\r\nBoston. Hon. John Erving, the father of the colonel, was one of the most\r\neminent merchants in America, and was a member of the Council of\r\nMassachusetts for twenty years. The Hon. Robert C. Winthrop, his\r\ngreat-grandson, in a public address in 1845, thus refers to him: \"A few\r\ndollars earned on a commencement day, by ferrying passengers over\r\nCharles River, when there was no bridge--shipped to Lisbon in the shape\r\nof fish, and from thence to London in the shape of fruit, and from\r\nthence brought home to be reinvested in fish, and to be re-entered upon\r\nthe same triangular circuit of trade--laid the foundations of the\r\nlargest fortunes of the day, a hundred years ago.\" Mr. Erving, by his\r\nwife Abigail, had a large family. He died in Boston in 1786, aged\r\nninety-three.\r\n\r\nCOLONEL JOHN ERVING, eldest son of the preceding, was born in Boston,\r\nJune 26, 1727, was a colonel of the Boston regiment of militia, a warden\r\nof Trinity church. He graduated at Harvard University in 1747. In 1760\r\nhe signed the Boston Memorial, and was thus one of the fifty-eight who\r\nwere the first men in America to array themselves against the officers\r\nof the Crown, but like many others that did not favor many acts of the\r\ngovernment, he could not tolerate mob rule, and therefore threw his lot\r\nin on the side that represented law and authority.\r\n\r\nWhen Hancock's sloop Liberty was seized for smuggling in 1768, by the\r\ncommissioners, the fury of the mob became great. They fell upon the\r\nofficers, several of whom barely escaped with their lives. Mr. Erving,\r\nbesides having his sword broken, was beaten with clubs and sticks, and\r\nconsiderably wounded. He was not concerned with the seizure of the\r\nsloop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAJOR GENERAL SIR DAVID OCHTERLONY.\r\n\r\nBorn in Boston Feb. 12, 1758. There is erected in Calcutta a monument to\r\nhim, which is one of the notable sights of that city. Died at Meerut,\r\nIndia in 1825.]\r\n\r\nIn 1774 he was an addresser of Hutchinson, and the same year appointed\r\nmandamus councillor. On the evacuation of Boston, he and his family\r\nof nine persons accompanied the army to Halifax, and from there he went\r\nto England. In 1778 he was proscribed and banished. He died at Bath,\r\nEngland, June 17, 1816, aged eighty-nine. His wife, Maria Catherina\r\n(youngest daughter of Governor Shirley), with whom he lived sixty years,\r\ndied a few months before him. A daughter of Mr. Erving married Governor\r\nScott of the island of Dominica and died at that island February 13,\r\n1768. His son, Dr. Shirley Erving, entered Harvard College in 1773, but\r\nhis education was cut short by the Revolution. He became a prominent\r\nphysician at Portland, Maine, and died at Boston in 1813, aged\r\nfifty-five. His widow survived him for many years. They left two sons\r\nand one daughter. The Erving mansion house was on Milk street, and was\r\nconfiscated.\r\n\r\nGEORGE ERVING was a prominent merchant of Boston. He was one of the\r\nfifty-eight memorialists who were the first men in America to array\r\nthemselves against the officers of the Crown, but he could not take part\r\nwith the mobs in their lawless and brutal actions. He was an Addresser\r\nof Hutchinson in 1774, was proscribed under the Act of 1778, and his\r\nestate was confiscated under the Conspiracy Act of 1779. He went to\r\nHalifax with his family of five persons, and thence to England. He died\r\nin London in 1806 at the age of seventy. His wife was a daughter of\r\nGeneral Isaac Royall of Medford.\r\n\r\n\r\n      CONFISCATED ESTATES BELONGING TO COLONEL JOHN ERVING AND TO\r\n                                 WHOM SOLD.\r\n\r\n     To James Lloyd, May 4. 1787; Lib. 160, fol. 105; Land and buildings\r\n       in Boston.

In 1226 the land of \"Othirlony\" was\r\nexchanged by his ancestors for those of Kenney in Forfarshire possessed\r\nby the Abbey of Aberbrothock. Kenney had been bestowed on the Abbey by\r\nits founder, King William, the Lion King of Scotland.\r\n\r\nDavid, was a captain in the merchant service, and resided for a while\r\nat Montrose. Boston was one of the many ports visited by him in his\r\nvoyages. Five years after his first appearance in Boston, June 4, 1757,\r\nintention of marriage was published, to Katherine, daughter of Andrew\r\nTyler of Boston, by his wife Miriam, a sister of Sir William Pepperell.\r\nOn 27th of June, 1762, he purchased a brick house with about 1500 square\r\nfeet of land on Back street, which at that time was that part of Salem\r\nstreet from Hanover to Prince street. Meanwhile three sons and daughter\r\nwere born. The eldest of these, MAJOR GENERAL SIR DAVID OCHTERLONY born\r\n12 Feb. 1758, who was to revive the name in a new locality. Captain\r\nOchterlony, the father, continued his career as a mariner but a few\r\nyears after locating in Boston, he died in 1765, at St. Vincent W. I.\r\nHis widow went to England, where she married Sir Isaac Heard of London,\r\nNorroy and Garter King of Arms, and gentleman of the Red Rod, to the\r\norder of the Bath.\r\n\r\nThe son David was a scholar at the Latin School in Boston, when his\r\nfather died. At the age of eighteen he entered the army and went to\r\nIndia, as a cadet, and in 1778 received an appointment as Ensign. In\r\n1781 he was Quartermaster to the 71st Regiment of Foot. During the\r\ntwenty years that succeeded, he was exposed to all the danger and\r\nfatigue of incessant service in the East. He attained the rank of Major\r\nin 1800 and of Lieutenant-Colonel in 1803, and Colonel in 1812. His\r\ncommission of Major General bears date June 1, 1814. In 1817 he received\r\nthe thanks of both Houses of Parliament. His health, after nearly fifty\r\nyears of uninterrupted military duty in a tropical climate, became\r\nimpaired and he resigned a political office in India with the intention\r\nof proceeding to Calcutta, and thence to England. This plan he did not\r\nlive to execute. He died at Meerut in 1825, while there for a change of\r\nair. He was Deputy-Adjutant-General at the Battle of Delhi, after which\r\nhe was sent as envoy to the Court of Sha Alum. For his conduct in the\r\nNepaulese war, he was created a Knight Commander of the Bath and May 7,\r\n1816, was made a baronet. After his death there was erected in Calcutta\r\na monument to him, which is one of the notable signs of the city. Sir\r\nDavid never married. His title descended to Charles Metcalf Ochterlony,\r\nand was succeeded in it by his son, the present baronet, Sir David\r\nFerguson Ochterlony. Gilbert Ochterlony, the second son of Captain\r\nDavid, died Jan. 16, 1780, aged 16, at the home of his step-father Isaac\r\nHeard, Esq., at the college of arms.[197] Alexander, the third son died\r\nin 1803, and Catherine in 1792.\r\n\r\n  [197] It was Sir Isaac Heard that took such pains in searching out the\r\n  pedigree of the Washington family.\r\n\r\nCaptain David's will, made at the time of his marriage, was probate\r\nMarch 7, 1766, and left everything to his wife Katrin, but his estate\r\nwas not settled till after the peace. 1791, and then it was insolvent,\r\nthe sum then obtained to close up the estate paid a dividend of only six\r\nand a half pence on the pound. The name of Ochterlony in New England\r\nbecame extinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           JUDGE AUCHMUTY'S FAMILY.\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert Auchmuty first of the American family of that name was descended\r\nfrom an ancient Scottish family, holding a barony in the north of that\r\ncountry. His father settled in England early in the eighteenth century,\r\nand Robert studied law at the Temple, London, and came to America and\r\nsettled in Boston about the year 1700. He was a profound lawyer and\r\npossessed remarkable talents and wit, but when he was admitted to\r\npractice does not appear. He was in practice soon after 1719 and the\r\nprofession owed much to his character and system and order which now\r\nbegan to distinguish its forms of practice. His talents were\r\nextraordinary, \"Old Mr. Auchmuty says a contemporary would sit up all\r\nnight at his bottle, yet argue to admiration next day, and was an\r\nadmirable speaker.\" He was sent to England to settle a boundary dispute\r\nbetween Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. His services\r\nwere so valuable, that on December 1738, he received from the former a\r\ngrant of two hundred acres of land. He was judge of the Court of\r\nAdmiralty for New England from 1733 until 1747. While he was in England\r\nhe advocated the expedition to Cape Breton in an ably written pamphlet\r\npublished in 1744. This tract probably gave to the historian Smollett\r\nthe erroneous impression that Auchmuty was the originator of that\r\nbrilliant enterprise, the credit of which belongs to Governor Shirley.\r\n\r\nJudge Auchmuty held his office until 1747 when he was superseded by\r\nChambers Russell. His home was in Roxbury, Massachusetts, and many\r\nanecdotes of him have been handed down from generation to generation. He\r\nwas \"greatly respected and beloved in public and private life.\" His\r\nmemory is held in high veneration by the bar in Massachusetts and his\r\nopinions are still respected.\r\n\r\nJudge Auchmuty died in April, 1750, leaving several children. His\r\ndaughter married Judge Pratt of New York and his son, Judge Robert\r\nAuchmuty, followed in his father's footstep, and became a noted lawyer\r\nin Massachusetts. Although he had not the advantage of a collegiate\r\neducation he became an able lawyer. As an advocate he was eloquent and\r\nsuccessful. \"Among his contemporaries were Otis, Quincy, Hawley, and\r\njudges Paine, Sargent, Bradbury, R. Sewall, W. Cushing and Sullivan and\r\nthough less learned than some of these he was employed in most of the\r\nimportant jury trials.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was when together with that class of lawyers above named that the\r\nprofession owed the respectability which since his day has characterized\r\nthe bar of Massachusetts.\"[198] He held the office of Advocate of the\r\nCourt of Admiralty from August 2, 1762, until his appointment as judge,\r\nhaving been originally appointed in the place of Mr. Bollan, to hold\r\nthe office during his absence. Chambers Russell was appointed in the\r\nplace of the elder Auchmuty as judge of the Admiralty for Massachusetts,\r\nNew Hampshire and Rhode Island in 1747. He held the office until his\r\ndeath in 1767, and Robert Auchmuty, the younger, was appointed by the\r\ngovernor to fill his place. This was in April, but on the sixth of July\r\nhe was duly commissioned as Judge of the Admiralty for all New England\r\nwith a salary of L300 a year. His commission was received in March,\r\n1760, when his salary was increased to L600 per annum. Judge Auchmuty\r\ncontinued to hold this office as long as the authority of the British\r\nwas recognized, as he was a zealous Loyalist.\r\n\r\n  [198] Updike History of Narrangansett church.\r\n\r\nRobert Auchmuty was one of the commissioners with Governor Wanton of\r\nRhode Island, Samuel Horsemanden, Chief Justice of New York, Frederic\r\nSmythe, Chief Justice of New Jersey, and Peter Oliver, Chief Justice of\r\nMassachusetts, to inquire into the destruction of the Gaspee, in\r\n1772.[199] He was a colleague of Adams and Quincy in defence of the\r\nBritish soldiers tried for participation in the \"Boston Massacre.\"[200]\r\nHe appeared once after his appointment in defence of Captain Preston and\r\nhis soldiers, and his argument was described as so memorable and\r\npersuasive, \"as almost to bear down the tide of prejudice against him,\r\nthough it never swelled to a higher flood.\"\r\n\r\n  [199] See page 52 for description of same.\r\n\r\n  [200] Ibid. 45.\r\n\r\nThe Auchmuty house in Roxbury stands at the corner of Cliff and\r\nWashington Streets. It was build about 1761 by the younger Judge\r\nAuchmuty, who resided there until the outbreak of the revolution. Here\r\nas a convenient halting place between the Province House and the\r\nGovernor's country seat at Jamaica Plain, and the Lieutenant Governor\r\nresidence at Milton, met the crown officers to make plans to stem the\r\nrising tide of disloyalty and lawlessness of the mobs, and their secret\r\nleaders. Here Bernard Hutchinson Auchmuty, Hallowell, and Paxton\r\ndiscussed the proposed alterations in the charter, and the bringing over\r\nof British troops to preserve the peace. Letters of Judge Auchmuty to\r\npersons in England were sent to America with those of Governor\r\nHutchinson by Franklin in 1773 and created much commotion.[201]\r\n\r\n  [201] See page 162.\r\n\r\nAt the Declaration of Independence in 1776 he left his native country\r\nand settled in England. At one period he was in very distressed\r\ncircumstances. He never returned to the United States and his estate was\r\nconfiscated. His mansion in Roxbury became the property of Governor\r\nIncrease Sunmer and was occupied by him at the time of his decease.\r\nAuchmuty Lane was that part of Essex Street between Short and South\r\nStreet in Boston. Robert Auchmuty died in London an exile from his\r\nnative land in November, 1778.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRITISH TROOPS PREVENTING THE DESTRUCTION OF NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nOn its evacuation by Washington; it was set on fire, it was saved by the\r\nsummary execution of all incendaries by the British.]\r\n\r\nHONORABLE JAMES AUCHMUTY, son of the elder Robert, was a storekeeper in\r\nthe Engineer Department. At the peace he removed to Nova Scotia where he\r\nbecame an eminent lawyer, and was appointed judge. He had a son, a\r\nvery gallant officer in the British Army, who was killed in the West\r\nIndies.\r\n\r\nREVEREND SAMUEL AUCHMUTY, another son of the elder Judge Auchmuty who\r\nsettled in New York, was born in Boston in 1725. He graduated from\r\nHarvard college in 1742 and was taken by his father to England, where he\r\nwas ordained a minister in the Episcopal church. The degree of D. D. was\r\nconferred on him by Oxford. He was appointed by the Society for the\r\nPropagation of the gospel, an assistant minister of Trinity church in\r\nNew York. He married in 1749 a daughter of Richard Nichols, governor of\r\nthat province. In 1764 at the death of the Rector of Trinity church he\r\nwas appointed to succeed him and took charge of all the churches in the\r\ncity, performing his arduous duties with faithfulness until the\r\nrevolution. In 1766 he received the degree of S. T. D. at Oxford. Dr.\r\nAuchmuty opposed the revolution and when the Americans took possession\r\nof New York City in 1777, it is said a message was sent him from Lord\r\nSterling by one of his sons, \"that if he read a prayer for the King the\r\nfollowing Sunday, he would send a band of soldiers and take him out of\r\nthe desk.\" His son, knowing his father's indomitable spirit did not\r\ndeliver the message, but with some of his classmates from Columbia\r\ncollege attended the church with arms concealed under their gowns and\r\nsat near the pulpit for his protection. His conscience would not allow\r\nhim to omit these prayers without violating his ordination vows. As soon\r\nas he commenced reading, Lord Sterling marched into the church with a\r\nband of soldiers and music playing Yankee Doodle. The Doctor's voice\r\nnever faltered and he finished his prayer and the soldiers marched up\r\none aisle and down another, and went out again without violence. After\r\nthe service Dr. Auchmuty sent for the keys of Trinity and its chapels,\r\nand ordered that they should not be opened again until the liturgy could\r\nbe performed without interruption, and took them to New Jersey. When the\r\nBritish took possession of New York he resolved at once to return to his\r\nloved flock and applied for leave to pass the American lines. This was\r\ndenied him. With the unfailing energy which marked his character he\r\ndetermined to return on foot through circuitous paths to avoid the\r\nAmerican lines. After undergoing great hardships, sleeping in the woods\r\nand great exposure, he reached the city. On its evacuation by\r\nWashington's Army it had been set on fire, and it was only by using the\r\nmost drastic means,--the summary execution of all incendaries by the\r\nBritish--that the city was saved from total destruction. Nearly one\r\nthousand buildings were burned in the western part of the city and among\r\nthem Trinity church, the Rector's home, and the Charity School. Through\r\nthe exertions of the British troops, St. Paul's and King's College\r\nbarely escaped. The Vestry of Trinity reported their loss at L22,000,\r\nbesides the annual rent of 246 lots of ground on which the buildings had\r\nbeen destroyed. After the fire, Dr. Auchmuty searched the ruins of his\r\nchurch and of his large and elegant mansion; all of his papers and\r\nrecords had been destroyed; he found no articles of value except the\r\nchurch plate and his own. His personal loss he estimated at upwards of\r\n$12,000.\r\n\r\nThe Sunday following Dr. Auchmuty preached in St. Paul's church for the\r\nlast time. The hardships which he had undergone terminated in an illness\r\nwhich resulted in his death after a few days. This venerable and\r\nconstant worker for mankind died March 4, 1777 in his fifty-second year,\r\nand was buried under the altar of St Paul's. Interesting notices of his\r\nlabors and sufferings and death may be found in Hawkins' \"Historical\r\nNotices of the Missions of the Church of England, in the North American\r\nColonies,\" London, 1845. By the old inhabitants of the city Dr. Auchmuty\r\nwas much respected and beloved and was spoken of as Bishop Auchmuty. He\r\nhad seven children. Jane, one of his daughters, married Richard Tylden\r\nof Milstead, of county Kent in England. One of her sons was Sir John\r\nMaxwell Tylden, who was in the army for twenty years in which he greatly\r\ndistinguished himself. Another, William Burton Tylden was a major in the\r\nRoyal Engineers. Dr. Auchmuty had two other daughters of which there is\r\nno account, save that they were married.\r\n\r\nSIR SAMUEL AUCHMUTY, the eldest son of the Rev. Dr. Auchmuty, was a\r\nLieutenant General in the British Army. At the beginning of the\r\nRevolution he was a student at Kings College and was intended by his\r\nfather for the ministry. His own inclinations were military from his\r\nboyhood and soon after he graduated he joined the Royal army under Sir\r\nWilliam Howe as an ensign in the 45th regiment and was present at most\r\nof the actions in that and the following year. In 1783 he commanded a\r\ncompany in the 75th Regiment, in the East Indies, and was with Lord\r\nCornwallis in the first siege of Seringaptarn. In 1801 he joined the\r\nexpedition to Egypt, and held the post of adjutant-general. He returned\r\nto England in 1803 and three years after was ordered to South America,\r\nwhere as brigadier-general, he assumed the command of the troops; and in\r\n1807 assaulted and reduced--after a most determined resistance--the city\r\nand fortress of Montevideo. In 1809 he was transferred to India.\r\nSubsequently he succeeded Sir D. Baird as chief of staff in Ireland. He\r\nwas knighted in 1812, his nephew, Sir John Maxwell Tylden,\r\nlieutenant-colonel of the 52 regiment being his proxy. He twice received\r\nthe thanks of Parliament, and was presented with a service of plate by\r\nthat body and by the East India Company. His seat was Syndale House, in\r\nKent, near Feversham. He died in Ireland suddenly in 1822 at the age of\r\n64.\r\n\r\nROBERT NICHOLAS AUCHMUTY, another son of the Rev. Dr. Auchmuty,\r\ngraduated at Kings College, New York and in the revolution served as a\r\nvolunteer in the British army. His wife was Henrietta, daughter of Henry\r\nJohn Overing and he died at Newport, Rhode Island in 1813. His daughter\r\nMaria M., widow of Colonel E. D. Wainwright of the United States\r\nMarines, died at Washington, D. C., Jan. 1861, aged 71.\r\n\r\nRICHARD HARRISON AUCHMUTY, brother of the above, was a surgeon in the\r\nBritish Army.

He had a son, Zachariah,\r\nborn in 1636, who was the ancestor of the subject of this sketch. Robert\r\nPaddock was probably a relative of Captain Leonard Peddock who was\r\nmaster of one of the ships that came to Plymouth in 1622, it being\r\nfrequently the case in those times that names were mis-spelled. This is\r\nthe origin of the name of Peddock's Island at the entrance of Boston\r\nHarbor. Branches of this family at the Revolutionary period were to be\r\nfound in various parts of New England, New Jersey, and South Carolina.\r\nAdino Paddock was the son of John and Rebecca (Thatcher) Paddock; was\r\nborn March 14, 1727, and was baptized in the First Church, Harwich,\r\nMarch 31, 1728.\r\n\r\nHis father died in 1732 and his mother removed soon after to Boston,\r\nwhere her name appears as a communicant in Brattle Square church \"from\r\nChurch East Yarmouth\" December 5, 1736. Adino Paddock was married in\r\nBoston, June 22, 1749, to Lydia Snelling, daughter of Robert and Lydia\r\n(Dexter). He settled in Boston, where he manufactured chaises and\r\ntransacted his business near the head of Bumstead Place. He lived\r\nopposite the burying ground, on the east side of Long-Acre Street. Adino\r\nPaddock was the first coach-maker of the town, and was a man of\r\nsubstance and character. His name is best known in connection with the\r\nfamous Paddock elms. Mr. James Smith, a prosperous sugar baker, whose\r\nhouse was on Queen Street,--now Court Street,--when in London, was\r\nstruck by the beauty of the elms in Brompton Park. The story goes that\r\nMr. Smith procured young trees of the same kind, and had them planted in\r\nhis nursery, on his beautiful farm, Brush Hill, in Milton. The fame of\r\nthese trees spreading, one of his friends, Mr. Gilbert Deblois, asked\r\nfor some, saying that he would in return name his newborn son for Mr.\r\nSmith. The bargain was struck, and James Smith Deblois, baptized May 16,\r\n1769, bore witness to its fulfilment. Other elms of this stock were also\r\nplanted, but those received by Mr. Gilbert Deblois became the most\r\ncelebrated. These were set out in front of the granary, just opposite\r\nMr. Deblois' house in Tremont Street. As Adino Paddock's shop window\r\nlooked out upon them, Mr. Deblois enjoined Mr. Paddock to have an eye to\r\ntheir safety.\r\n\r\nIt is related that on one occasion, Paddock offered the reward of a\r\nguinea, for the detection of the person who \"hacked\" one or more of the\r\ntrees. He guarded the infant elms very carefully and the \"Gleaner\" tells\r\nof his darting across the street upon one occasion and vigorously\r\nshaking an idle boy who was making free with one of the sacred saplings.\r\nThe elms were thought to have been planted in 1762. They grew to\r\nmagnificent proportions, and withstood the axe for more than a century.\r\nThey escaped in 1860, but were cut down a few years later. The largest\r\nwas one that stood near the Tremont House. Its circumference near the\r\nsidewalk was nearly seventeen feet. This was the largest of all the\r\ntrees belonging to the public walks of the city, excepting the great\r\nAmerican elm on Boston Common that was destroyed by the tornado of 1869.\r\n\r\nAdino Paddock was in 1774 captain of the train of artillery belonging in\r\nBoston of which John Erving was colonel. This company was particularly\r\ndistinguished for its superior discipline and the excellence of its\r\nmaterial. The gun house stood at the corner of West and Tremont Streets,\r\nseparated by a yard from the school house. In this gun house was kept\r\ntwo brass three-pounders, which had been recast from two old guns sent\r\nby the town to London for that purpose, and had the arms of the province\r\nengraved upon them. They arrived in Boston in 1768, and were first used\r\nat the celebration of the King's birthday, June 4th, when a salute was\r\nfired in King Street.\r\n\r\nWhen the mobs began to be in evidence Captain Paddock expressed an\r\nintention to turn them over to General Gage, for safe keeping, some of\r\nthe men that composed the company, resolved, that it should not be so,\r\nthey met in the school-room, and watching their opportunity they crossed\r\nthe yard, entered the building and, removing the guns from their\r\ncarriages, carried them to the school room where they were concealed in\r\na box in which fuel was kept. They were finally taken to the American\r\nlines, in a boat, and were in actual service during the whole war. The\r\ntwo guns were called the \"Hancock\" and \"Adams,\" and were in charge of\r\nthe Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company, until presented in 1825 by\r\nthe State to the Bunker Hill Monument Association. They are now\r\nsuspended in the chamber at the top of Bunker Hill Monument, with a\r\nsuitable inscription on each.\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Paddock's departure from Boston he was entitled to the higher\r\nmilitary appellation of Colonel. As an active officer, and for a time\r\ncommander of the Boston train of artillery, he felt himself particularly\r\nhonored, as he was then in a position of great usefulness, for, in fact\r\nhis lessons in military matters while in the Train, were productive of\r\nmuch good, as laying the foundation of good soldiership, in the\r\nProvince, by giving thorough instruction to many who afterwards became\r\ndistinguished officers in the revolutionary war.\r\n\r\nArdently attached to the interests of the government he was one of the\r\nforemost of the loyalist party. He left Boston at the evacuation, March\r\n17, 1776. There were nine in his family. They went to Halifax and in the\r\nfollowing June he embarked with his wife and children for England.\r\n\r\nIn 1778 he was proscribed and banished. From 1781 until his death he\r\nresided on the Isle of Jersey and for several years held the office of\r\nInspector of Artillery Stores with rank of Captain. Colonel Paddock\r\nreceived a partial compensation for his losses as a Loyalist, and died\r\nMarch 25, 1804, aged seventy-six years. Lydia, his wife died at the Isle\r\nof Jersey, in 1781, aged fifty-one.\r\n\r\nColonel Paddock's house was situated on the south corner of Bromfield\r\nand Tremont Streets, formerly Common Street and Ransom Lane. Thomas\r\nBumstead, a coach-maker, purchased the estate when it was confiscated\r\nand carried on the coach-making business there. Bumstead Place was laid\r\nout in 1807 on the site of the home, and was closed in 1868. Gilbert\r\nDeblois occupied the opposite corner, on which was built Horticultural\r\nHall, the trustees of the new office building recently erected there, at\r\nthe suggestion of Alex S. Porter, named the new building the \"Paddock\r\nBuilding\" who said \"I think that we ought to do all we can to preserve\r\nthe memory of those good old citizens who by their influence and hard\r\nlabor did so much in laying the foundation of our beloved city.\"\r\n\r\nAdino Paddock and Lydia Snelling had thirteen children, nine of them\r\ndied in infancy, and John a student at Harvard College was drowned while\r\nbathing in Charles River in 1773.\r\n\r\nADINO PADDOCK, the younger, accompanied his father to Halifax in 1776\r\nand in 1779 followed his father to England, where he entered upon the\r\nstudy of medicine and surgery. Having attended the different hospitals\r\nof London and fitted himself for practice, he returned to America before\r\nthe close of the Revolution, and was surgeon of the King's American\r\nDragoons. In 1784 he married Margaret Ross of Casco Bay, Maine, and\r\nsettling at St. John, New Brunswick, confined his attention to\r\nprofessional pursuits. In addition to extensive and successful private\r\npractice he enjoyed from Government the post of surgeon to the ordinance\r\nof New Brunswick. He died at St. Mary's, York County in 1817, aged 58.\r\nMargaret his wife died at St. John in 1815 at the age of 50. The fruit\r\nof this union was ten children, of whom three sons, Adino, Thomas and\r\nJohn were educated physicians. Adino commenced practice in 1808 at\r\nKingston, New Brunswick. Thomas married Mary, daughter of Arthur\r\nMcLellan, Esq., of Portland, Maine, and died at St. John, deeply\r\nlamented in 1838, aged 47.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LIST OF CONFISCATED ESTATES BELONGING TO ADINO PADDOCK IN SUFFOLK COUNTY\r\n                                AND TO WHOM SOLD.\r\n\r\n     To Thomas Bumstead.

As he was devoted to the Church of\r\nEngland, it may be presumed that he came from that country, and the date\r\nof his eldest child's birth makes it likely that he was born before\r\n1640. This branch of the Lillie family probably lived for a while in\r\nNewfoundland, and if so, they are likely to have been of the Devonshire\r\nor West-of-England stock, which supplied the first settlers for that\r\nProvince. They became possessed of real estate at St. John's during the\r\nlatter half of the seventeenth century, described as \"a plantation\"--a\r\nterm signifying full proprietorship.\r\n\r\nEdward Lillie married about 1661, Elizabeth, whose maiden name is\r\nunknown. He was one of the well known citizens of the town of Boston\r\nwhen its estimated population was from five to seven thousand\r\ninhabitants. In 1687 he was one of the sixty citizens whose property was\r\nrated at L50 or more,--taking rank with such contemporaries as Elisha\r\nand Eliakim Hutchinson, Adam Winthrop, Samuel and Anthony Checkley, and\r\nSimon Lynde.[202] Edward Lillie carried on a large business as \"cooper,\"\r\nat that period one of the most important industries of New England in\r\nits connection with commerce.\r\n\r\n  [202] Memorial Hist. of Boston, II. 8. Record Com. Report VII. 69.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1670 Edward Lillie had land \"in his tenure and occupation\" at\r\nthe North End. He purchased July 8, 1670, an estate at what was then the\r\nSouth End of the town,--a dwelling-house and land. This estate was\r\nsituated on the south-east corner of Washington and Bedford Streets, and\r\nit is in part now (1907) the site of R. H. White's dry-goods\r\nestablishment. In January 1674 he purchased of Captain Thomas Savage\r\nland on Conduit (now North) Street and erected thereon in 1684 a brick\r\ndwelling-house. The estate was valued in inventory at L1300.\r\n\r\nEdward Lillie's will was dated December 24, 1688, and proved January 7,\r\n1688-9. His wife was probably the \"Mrs. Lily\" whose death, according to\r\ntown records, took place January 4, 1705. They had six children.\r\n\r\nSamuel Lilly, born March 20, 1663, was the eldest child. June 4, 1683,\r\nhe married at the age of twenty Mehitable Frary, daughter of Captain\r\nand Deacon Theophilus Frary, one of the founders of the Old South\r\nChurch. Her mother was the daughter of Jacob Eliot, and the niece of\r\nJohn Eliot, the \"Apostle to the Indians.\" Mehitable, was born February\r\n4, 1665-6, and as her father had no sons, his estate was divided between\r\nthe daughters.\r\n\r\nSamuel Lillie, like his father, was a \"cooper,\" but early in life became\r\ninterested in commerce, sending as early as May 23, 1684, merchandise to\r\nthe island of Nevis. For the next twenty-three years he was widely\r\nengaged in commercial transactions, and was uniformly styled \"merchant\"\r\nin formal documents. After his father's death he bought and occupied the\r\nlatter's premises at the North End, enlarging them by other purchases.\r\n\r\nMrs. Royall, wife of Isaac Royall and mother of the Loyalist was a\r\ncousin of Mrs. Samuel Lillie. During his latter years Samuel Lillie was\r\nabsent from America quite frequently. It is not likely that he was in\r\nBoston from 1708 till shortly before his death.[203] Mrs. Lillie died\r\nMarch 4, 1723. They had eleven children, born in Boston and baptised\r\n(except one or two) in the Second church, each a few days after birth.\r\n\r\n  [203] \"The Lillie Family of Boston\" by Edward L. Pierce.\r\n\r\nTheophilus Lillie, the fourth child of Samuel and Mehitable Lillie, was\r\nbaptized August 24, 1690. He married July 8, 1725, Hannah Ruck (Rev.\r\nCotton Mather officiating). Seems to have done much in settling his\r\nfather's affairs, but was not engaged in active business.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of July, 1732, in Town Meeting, he with others, was\r\nappointed a committee to receive proposals, touching the demolishing,\r\nrepairing, or leasing out the old buildings belonging to the town in\r\nDock Square. The committee to give their attendance at Mr. William\r\nCoffin's the Bunch of Grapes tavern, on Thursdays weekly, from six to\r\neight o'clock in the evening. In 1736 he appears as one of the\r\nsubscribers to Prince's Chronological History of Boston, the list\r\ncontaining, according to Drake, the names of persons most interested at\r\nthat period in literary concerns.\r\n\r\nHannah Ruck, his wife, was born December 4, 1703 and was the daughter of\r\nJohn Ruck, a successful merchant, a citizen active in municipal affairs\r\nand holding municipal offices. Her mother was Hannah Hutchinson,\r\ndaughter of Colonel Elisha Hutchinson, and aunt of Thomas Hutchinson,\r\nthe last Royal Governor. A close friendship existed between the two\r\nfamilies, and their homes were near together at the North End. This\r\nfriendship was continued in Halifax, after the Loyalist exodus in 1776.\r\n\r\nTheophilus Lillie sold the family estate at the corner of Newbury and\r\nPond Streets March 9, 1754. Before this sale he had removed to the Ruck\r\nhomestead \"near the old North Meeting House.\" Mr. Lillie died late in\r\nMarch, 1760. He left but little property. His eldest son Samuel, died\r\nyoung and John and Theophilus Lillie were his father's sole heirs.\r\n\r\nTHEOPHILUS LILLIE, the youngest son, was born August 18, 1730. He\r\nmarried late in 1757 (intentions of marriage published October 27, 1757)\r\nAnn Barker, who had been a shop-keeper, in company with Abiel Page,\r\n\"near Rev. Mr. Mather's meeting-house.\" He was educated as a merchant\r\nand was in retail trade as early as 1758, as shown by the numerous\r\ncollection suits brought by him, and his advertisements in the Boston\r\n\"Gazette\" May 22 of that year. His store was on \"Middle (Hanover)\r\nStreet, near Mr. Pemberton's meeting-house.\" His stock was miscellaneous\r\nEnglish Dry Goods and Groceries.\r\n\r\nWhen it was determined to resist the tax on imports, a non-importation\r\nagreement was entered into in August, 1768, by the merchants of Boston,\r\nmany were forced to sign it through fear of offending the mob, the\r\nagreement ended in 1769, and some of those who had been forced into it\r\nwere determined to proceed in their regular business, and would pay no\r\nattention to a renewal of it, among these was Theophilus Lillie. They\r\nwere proscribed and persecuted for several weeks by the rabble\r\ncollecting to interrupt customers, passing to and from their shops, and\r\nhouses, by posts erected before their shops with a hand pointed towards\r\nthem, and by many marks of derision. At length on February 22nd, 1770, a\r\nmore powerful mob than common, collected before the house of Theophilus\r\nLillie and set up a post on which was a large Wooden Head, with a board\r\nfaced paper, on which was painted the figures of four of the principal\r\nimporters. One of the neighbors, Ebenezer Richardson, found fault with\r\nthe proceedings which provoked the mob to drive him into his home for\r\nshelter. Having been a custom house officer, he was peculiarly obnoxious\r\nto the mob. They surrounded his house, threw stones and brick-bats\r\nthrough the windows, and, as it appeared upon trial were forcing their\r\nway in, when he fired upon them, and killed a boy eleven or twelve years\r\nof age. He was soon seized, and another person, George Wilmot with him,\r\nwho happened to be in the house. They were in danger of being sacrificed\r\nto the rage of the mob, being dragged through the streets and a halter\r\nhaving been prepared, but some more temperate than the rest, advised to\r\ncarry him before a justice of peace, who committed him to prison.\r\n\r\nThe boy that was killed was Christopher Snider, the son of a poor\r\nGerman. The event was taken advantage of by Sam Adams, and other\r\nrevolutionary leaders to raise the passion of the people, and thereby\r\nstrengthen their cause. A grand funeral therefore was judged to be the\r\nproper course to pursue. In the _Evening Post_ of 26 Feb. is a very\r\nminute account of the affair, which had a very great deal to do with\r\nsubsequent events. The corpse was set down under 'Liberty Tree' whence\r\nthe procession began. About 50 school boys preceded, and there was \"at\r\nleast 2000 in the procession, of all ranks, amid a crowd of spectators.\"\r\nThe pall was supported by six youths chosen by the parents of the\r\ndeceased. On the Liberty Tree and upon each side and foot of the coffin\r\nwere inscriptions well calculated to excite sympathy for the deceased,\r\nand at the same time indignation against him, who occasioned his death.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of April following the two culprits were tried for their\r\nlives. Richardson was brought in guilty of murder, but Wilmot was\r\nacquitted. Drake says \"In this account of the case of Richardson and\r\nWilmot, it must be borne in mind that it is almost entirely made up from\r\nthe facts detailed by their enemies. Richardson was no doubt insulted\r\nbeyond endurance, which caused his rashness, in a moment of intense\r\nexcitement he fired on the mob. These facts doubtless had their weight\r\nwith the court, for the Chief Justice Thomas Hutchinson, viewed the\r\nguilt of Richardson as everybody would now, a clear case of justifiable\r\nhomicide, and consequently refused to sign a warrant for his execution,\r\nand, after lying in prison two years, was, on application to the King\r\npardoned and set at liberty.\"[204]\r\n\r\n  [204] Drake's History of Boston, p. 777.\r\n\r\nAfter the affair of the Wooden Figure at Lillie's, there was constant\r\ntrouble in Boston between the soldiers and roughs of the town, until the\r\n5th of March, when occurred the affray between the Mob and the Soldiers\r\nknown as the \"Boston Massacre.\"[205]\r\n\r\n  [205] See pages 43 and 44 for account of the \"Massacre.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lillie had taken no part in the affair that happened near his store,\r\nbut popular feeling was influenced by that occurrence against him. Mr.\r\nLillie's full statement of the interference with his business by the\r\nillegal committee of citizens, will be found in the \"Massachusetts\r\nGazette,\" January 11, 1770. An extract will show his attitude towards\r\nthe affair.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the whole, I cannot help saying--although I have never entered far\r\ninto the mysteries of government, having applied myself to my shop and\r\nmy business--that it always seemed strange to me that people who contend\r\nso much for civil and religious liberty should be so ready to deprive\r\nothers of their natural liberty: that men who are guarding against being\r\nsubject to laws [to] which they never gave their consent in person or by\r\ntheir representative should at the same time make laws, and in the most\r\neffectual manner execute them upon me and others, to which laws I am\r\nsure I never gave my consent either in person or by my representative.\r\nBut what is still more hard, they are laws made to punish me after I\r\nhave committed the offence; for when I sent for my goods, I was told\r\nnobody was to be compelled to subscribe; after they came, I was required\r\nto store them. This in no degree answered the end of the subscription,\r\nwhich was to distress the manufacturers in England. Now, my storing my\r\ngoods could never do this; the mischief was done when the goods were\r\nbought in England; and it was too late to help it. My storing my goods\r\nmust be considered, therefore, as punishment for an offence before the\r\nlaw for punishing it was made.\r\n\r\n\"If one set of private subjects may at any time take upon themselves to\r\npunish another set of private subjects just when they please, it's such\r\na sort of government as I never heard of before; and according to my\r\npoor notion of government, this is one of the principal things which\r\ngovernment is designed to prevent; and I own I had rather be a slave\r\nunder one master (for I know who he is, I may perhaps be able to please\r\nhim) than a slave to a hundred or more whom I don't know where to find,\r\nnor what they will expect of me.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1770 Mr. Lillie removed to Oxford in Worcester County,--a removal\r\ninduced probably by his recent experiences in Boston. His domicile is\r\nstated to be in that town in actions brought by him in Suffolk County.\r\nOn account of his political views his new residence did not prove to be\r\nany more congenial than Boston had been.\r\n\r\nIn 1772 he attached for a debt the house of Dr. Alexander Campbell and\r\nthe people of Oxford took umbrage, and threatened him with violence. In\r\nthe same year he sold his place in Oxford, and returned to Boston. He\r\nbought in 1774 an estate in Brookfield, but it does not appear that he\r\nlived upon it at any time. Until the political troubles Mr. Lillie seems\r\nto have been in good circumstances, and to have kept up in his manner of\r\ndress the fashions of the period, according to family traditions. He\r\nleft Boston in March, 1776 with the British troops for Halifax. His\r\nfamily thus embarking numbered four persons--himself and wife, and one\r\nof the other two being, doubtless, a negro servant.\r\n\r\nMr. Lillie's death occurred in Halifax two months after leaving Boston,\r\non May 12. His property in Massachusetts was confiscated. Jacob Cooper,\r\nof Boston, administered on his estate. Mrs. Lillie continued to live at\r\nHalifax, and notwithstanding the confiscation proceedings, she undertook\r\nto collect, by suits in Massachusetts in 1784-85, some of the debts due\r\nto her husband. The Confiscation Act however, was a bar to any recovery.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lillie survived her husband eighteen years. Her funeral is\r\nregistered on the records of St. Paul's church, Halifax, as being on\r\nSeptember 16, 1794, at the age of seventy-nine. Her will dated December\r\n10, 1791, and August 5, 1794 (appointing Foster Hutchinson, the younger,\r\nExecutor) was proved September 20, 1794, on the oath of John Masters and\r\nFoster Hutchinson, the younger. Certain provisions of the will show a\r\nparticular interest in a colored servant. The will provides: \"It is also\r\nmy will and intention that my black man Caesar be free, and that the sum\r\nof ten pounds be retained and left in the hands of my hereinafter named\r\nexecutor, to be applied to the use of said Caesar in case of sickness,\r\nor other necessity, at the discretion of said executor.\" She also\r\nbequeathed to him \"a suit of mourning cloths suitable for a man in his\r\nsituation in life\"; and in a later codicil, \"the feather-bed and\r\nbedstead whereupon he usually sleeps, and also the bedclothes and\r\nbedding belonging thereto.\" Mr. Lillie's confiscated personal effects\r\nindicate that he lived in a liberal style. At the time of his death.\r\nGovernor Hutchinson, then in England, wrote in his Diary, July 24, 1776:\r\n\r\nWhen I came home I heard of Mr. Lillie's death at Halifax. What numbers\r\nhave been brought to poverty, sickness, and death by refusing to concur\r\nwith the present measures of America!\r\n\r\nTheophilus Lillie died childless. Search was made in July, 1895, by\r\nEdward Lillie Pierce and his son George, in the old graveyard at\r\nHalifax, but no stone for him or his wife was discovered, although her\r\nfuneral had been duly recorded in the church register. The stones of\r\nFoster Hutchinson and his family were well preserved; and the Lillie\r\nstone if ever set up, would be likely to be found near them.\r\n\r\nMr. Lillie's personal property in Massachusetts was disposed of and his\r\nthree pieces of real estate were sold at public auction. His debts were\r\nsmall and the whole amount turned into the treasury, L595, valued at\r\nL446 in sterling money. The public gain was considerable.\r\n\r\nJOHN LILLIE, the only surviving brother of Theophilus was born August 8,\r\n1728. He is described as a \"mariner\" in public documents, but no details\r\nof his career on the sea have been transmitted. He married in Trinity\r\nchurch, August 16, 1754 Abigail Breck (born June 19, 1732.) She was the\r\ndaughter of John and Margaret Breck. John Lillie died April, 1765, and\r\nhis will was proved on the 19th. He left six children. John Lillie, his\r\nson, became a Major in the Continental Army and served in many\r\nengagements with great bravery during the war. General Washington\r\ncertified that Major Lillie \"conducted himself on all occasions with\r\ndignity, bravery, and intelligence.\" He was married to Elizabeth Vose,\r\nJanuary 20, 1785, and was survived by several children.\r\n\r\nMehitable and Ann Lillie, two of John Lillie's daughters (the mariner)\r\nhave always with their descendants been well known.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LIST OF CONFISCATED ESTATES BELONGING TO THEOPHILUS LILLIE IN SUFFOLK\r\n                        COUNTY AND TO WHOM SOLD.\r\n\r\n     To John Greenough, May 26, 1781; Lib. 132, fol. 216.

SYLVESTER GARDINER.\r\n\r\n\r\nSylvester Gardiner was born in South Kingston, Rhode Island, in 1707. He\r\nwas descended from the first emigrant of the name to the Narragansett\r\ncountry. His father was William Gardiner, the son of Benoni, the son of\r\nJoseph, an English emigrant. Sylvester was the fourth son of William\r\nGardiner and was educated by his brother-in-law, the Rev. Dr. McSparran,\r\nfor the medical profession. He studied eight years in England and\r\nFrance, and returning to Boston, entered and pursued a successful\r\nprofessional career. He established a store for the importation of drugs\r\nand acquired a fortune. He accumulated much real estate in Maine and\r\nbecame proprietor of one-twelfth part of the \"Plymouth Purchase,\"\r\nso-called, on the Kennebec River. At one time he owned 100,000 acres and\r\nwas grantor of much of the land in ancient Pittston. \"His efforts to\r\nsettle the large domain were unceasing from the year 1753 to the\r\nRevolution. He was made perpetual moderator of the proprietors at all\r\ntheir meetings; he executed their plans, built mills, houses, stores and\r\nwharves, cleared lands, made generous offers to emigrants; established\r\nan episcopal mission, and furnished the people of that region with their\r\nfirst religious instruction. And most of all this was accomplished with\r\nhis own money.\"[206] He erected houses and mills at Swan Island,\r\nPownalborough and other places, and was the author of the beginnings of\r\nmany settlements. He was a public spirited man of great zeal and energy,\r\nbroad and liberal in his views.\r\n\r\n  [206] Sabine's Loyalists, Vol. I. p. 459.\r\n\r\nDr. Gardiner was married three times. His first wife was Anne, daughter\r\nof Doctor John Gibbons of Boston; his second, Abigail Eppes of Virginia;\r\nhis third, Catharine Goldthwaite. In Boston he was respected by all\r\nclasses. Of the \"Government Party,\" he entertained as guests, Sir\r\nWilliam Pepperell, Governor Hutchinson, Earl Percy, Admiral Graves,\r\nMajor Pitcairn, General Gage, Major Small and others. He was an\r\nAddresser of the Royal Governors in 1774 and the year following he\r\nbecame identified with the Royal cause. In 1776, at the evacuation, he\r\nabandoned all and found temporary shelter at Halifax. When he left his\r\nnative country close to the age of three score and ten, he took only\r\nabout L400 with him. The vessel in which he embarked was destitute of\r\ncommon comforts, poorly supplied with provisions, and the cabin, which\r\nhe and several members of his family occupied, was small and crowded\r\nwith passengers. In 1778 he was proscribed and banished and settled in\r\nPoole, England. His property in Boston and Maine was confiscated and all\r\ngoods that could be found were sold at public auction. A library\r\ncontaining five hundred volumes, was sold in 1778-79 at auction by\r\nWilliam Cooper. His books and other personal effects amounted to\r\nL1658.18.\r\n\r\nThe estates on the Kennebec were confiscated but the Attorney-General\r\nfound that the action was illegally prosecuted and instituted new\r\nproceedings. Before they were brought to a close peace was declared and\r\nthe proceedings stayed. The heirs of Dr. Gardiner learned these facts\r\nand obtained the property. Had there not been a flaw in the first suit\r\nthis would not have been the case.\r\n\r\n\"In 1785 Doctor Gardiner returned to the United States. For a part of\r\nhis losses he petitioned Massachusetts for compensation. He had never\r\nborne arms, he said, nor entered into any association, combination or\r\nsubscription against the Whigs. When he quitted Boston, he stated, too,\r\nthat he had in his possession a valuable stock of drugs, medicines,\r\npaints, groceries and dye stuffs, which having a vessel fully equipped\r\nand entirely under his control, he could easily have carried off, but\r\nwhich he left, of choice, for the benefit of the country, which he knew\r\nwas in need. The claim was acknowledged to the extent of giving his\r\nheirs tickets in the State Land Lottery, by which they obtained nearly\r\nsix thousand acres in the county of Washington, Maine.\"[207]\r\n\r\n  [207] Sabine's Loyalists, Vol. I, p 460.\r\n\r\nWashington, on taking possession of Boston, ordered the medicines, etc.,\r\nin Doctor Gardiner's store, to be transferred to the hospital department\r\nfor the use of the Continental Army; but the State authorities\r\ninterfered and required delivery to the Sheriff of Suffolk county. The\r\nresult, however, was a vote of the council complying with the\r\nrequisition of the commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nAfter the peace Doctor Gardiner resided in Newport, Rhode Island, where\r\nhe still practiced medicine and surgery. There he died suddenly of a\r\nmalignant fever on August 8, 1786, in his eightieth year. His body was\r\ninterred under Trinity church and his funeral was attended by most of\r\nthe citizens. The shipping displayed its colors at half-mast, and much\r\nrespect was shown by the people. Dr. Gardiner had always been\r\nphilanthropic and a benefit to mankind. He seems to have been identified\r\nin church work wherever he lived and from the following extract appears\r\nto have been a member of King's chapel, while residing in Boston: \"April\r\n3, 1740.--Rec'd of Mr. Sylvester Gardiner Sixteen Pounds Two Shills, in\r\nfull for wine for the Chapple for the year past. John Hancock.\"[208]\r\n\r\n  [208] \"Dealings with the Dead,\" by a Sexton of the Old School.\r\n\r\nDr. Gardiner acted conscientiously in his course in remaining loyal and\r\nhis \"Christian fortitude and piety were exemplary as his honesty was\r\ninflexible and his friendship sincere.\"[209] In the Episcopal church in\r\nGardiner, Maine, near the pulpit, a beautiful cenotaph of black marble\r\nabout eight feet high enclosed in a fine oaken frame, is erected to the\r\nmemory of Dr. Gardiner, by Robert Hallowell Gardiner, his grandson and\r\nheir.\r\n\r\n  [209] Newport Mercury. Aug. 14, 1786.\r\n\r\nJOHN GARDINER, the eldest son of Dr. Sylvester Gardiner, was born in\r\nBoston in 1731, and was sent to England, to complete his education. He\r\nstudied law at Inner Temple and practiced in the courts of Westminster\r\nHall. He received the appointment of Attorney-General in the West Indies\r\nat St. Christopher's. He was denied promotion by the British Government\r\nbecause of his sympathy for the Whigs, and in 1783 he returned to\r\nBoston. On February 13, 1784, John Gardiner, his wife, Margaret, and\r\ntheir children were naturalized. John Gardiner was an ardent reformer\r\nand an active Unitarian. He was the principal agent in transforming the\r\nKing's Chapel into a Unitarian church. He wrote an able treatise in\r\ndefence of the theatre. Removing to Pownalborough, Maine, he represented\r\nthat town in the General Court from 1789 until his death in 1793-94. He\r\nwas drowned by the loss of a packet in which he was sailing to Boston to\r\nattend the session of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nJOHN SYLVESTER JOHN, son of John Gardiner, was born in Wales in 1765.\r\nHis father had left America in 1748 before he was of age and resided in\r\nEngland and South Wales until 1768, when he went to St. Christopher's,\r\nremaining in the West Indies until 1783. John Sylvester John, became an\r\nable theological and political writer. He was rector of Trinity church,\r\nBoston, from 1805 until his death, which occurred at Harrowgate Springs,\r\nEngland, in 1830, while traveling for his health.\r\n\r\nA tablet was erected in Trinity church to the memory of John Sylvester\r\nJohn Gardiner, who had first been an assistant and later the rector of\r\nthe church. At the time of the great Boston fire, November 9, 1872, when\r\nold Trinity church on Summer street was destroyed, this tablet was the\r\nonly relic saved from the interior of the church. It was rescued from\r\nthe flames by a great-grandson of John Sylvester John Gardiner, and is\r\nnow in Trinity church, Copley square. Boston.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM GARDINER, son of the rector, was an eminent Boston lawyer. He\r\nhad two daughters, Louisa, who married John Cushing of Watertown, and\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM GARDINER, the second son of Sylvester Gardiner, removed to\r\nGardinerston, Maine, soon after the settlement commenced. He employed a\r\nhousekeeper and entertained his friends and was famous for his fun\r\nmaking. He gave offence to the Whigs because he \"would drink tea\";\r\nbecause he refused to swear allegiance to their cause; and because he\r\ncalled them \"Rebels.\" \"Arrangements were made to take him from his bed\r\nat night, and tar and feather him, but a Whig, friendly to him, carried\r\nhim to a place of safety. He was, however, made prisoner, tried and sent\r\nto jail in Boston.\"[210] In March, 1778, he petitioned for release and\r\nwas soon after allowed to return home where \"he was regarded as a\r\nharmless man and was allowed for the most part to remain unmolested,\r\nexcept by petty annoyances.\" William Gardiner died, unmarried at\r\nGardiner, Maine, and was buried \"beneath the Episcopal vestry.\"\r\n\r\n  [210] Sabine's Loyalists, Vol. I, p. 462.\r\n\r\nANNE GARDINER, third child of Sylvester Gardiner, married the second son\r\nof the Earl of Altamont. HANNAH, a fourth child, was the wife of Robert\r\nHallowell. REBECCA, the fifth child, married Philip Dumarisque. Last,\r\nABIGAIL, married Oliver Whipple, counsellor-at-law, Cumberland, Rhode\r\nIsland, and subsequently of Portsmouth, New Hampshire.\r\n\r\nNearly the whole of the estate in Maine passed under the provisions of\r\nDoctor Gardiner's will, to Hannah's only son, Robert Hallowell, who, as\r\none of the conditions of that instrument, added the name of Gardiner.\r\nJohn on account of his political and religious opinions failed to become\r\nthe principal heir, and William \"was not an efficient man.\"\r\n\r\nSylvanus Gardiner's second wife was the widow of William Eppes of\r\nVirginia, daughter of Col. Benj. Pickman of Salem. She died at Poole,\r\nEngland, leaving a son, Wm. Eppes, who married Miss Randolph of Bristol,\r\nwhose son was a commissary general in the British Army. A daughter,\r\nLove Eppes, married Sir John Lester of Poole, and Abigail Eppes married\r\nRichard Routh, a loyalist.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LIST OF CONFISCATED ESTATES BELONGING TO SYLVESTER GARDINER IN SUFFOLK\r\n                           COUNTY AND TO WHOM SOLD.\r\n\r\n     To William Coleman, Benjamin Coleman, Dec 12. 1782.

In consequence, apparently of this circumstance, his\r\ntroubles soon began, after the attack and destruction of Mr.\r\nHutchinson's residence, of which the following outrage appears to have\r\nbeen an imitation, and the story has been handed down by no less a\r\nperson than John Adams: \"Taking advantage of the disorders occasioned by\r\nthe passage of the Stamp Act, a party disguised as Indians, on the night\r\nof the 16th of March, 1760, broke into his store, and his dwelling-home\r\nalso, and destroyed his books and papers, containing evidences of debts.\r\nNot content with this, they laid waste his property and threatened his\r\nlife if he should venture to seek legal mode of redress.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Adams was counsel for King, and he, who had no pity for Hutchinson,\r\nbut rather rejoiced in the impunity of his assailants, writes, \"The\r\nterror and distress, the distraction and horror of his family cannot be\r\ndescribed by words or painted on canvas. It is enough to move a statue,\r\nto melt a heart of stone to read the story.\"[211]\r\n\r\n  [211] John Adams' Letters to His Wife. Note to No. 9.\r\n\r\nThe popular bitterness then engendered did not, however, subside, and in\r\n1774, a slight incident occurred which soon caused it once more to break\r\nout. A vessel of Mr. King's was found to have delivered a load of lumber\r\nin Boston, by special license, after the port had been closed, and the\r\nmaterial had been purchased for the use of the troops. On this occasion\r\nforty men from the neighboring town of Gorham came over and compelled\r\nMr. King, in fear of his life, to make a disavowal of his opinion. These\r\nrepeated shocks seem to have been too much for Mr. King's constitution.\r\nHe became insane and died in the following March.\r\n\r\nSuch were the means adopted by the Sons of Despotism, to make patriots,\r\nto convert their fellow countrymen to their ways of thinking.\r\nIntimidation and oppression are the accompaniments of all successful\r\nrevolutions. The same holds true of the methods adopted at the present\r\ntime by the leaders of a strike. The leaders, like the revolutionary\r\nleaders, are unwilling to acknowledge that they are disturbers of the\r\npeace, or that acting under them their followers are brutally assailing\r\nthose who seek employment under other than union conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHARLES PAXTON.\r\n\r\n                        COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of this sketch was born at Boston, February 28, 1707.\r\nWentworth Paxton and Faith, his wife, were his parents. Charles Paxton\r\nwas a Commissioner of Customs and as such early incurred the ill will of\r\nthe so-called patriotic party. In 1769 he and his associates were posted\r\nin the \"Boston Gazette,\" by James Otis. It was this card of Otis which\r\nbrought on the altercation with Robinson, another commissioner, in the\r\ncoffee-house in State street, and which resulted in injuries to the head\r\nof the first champion of the revolution, from which he never recovered.\r\nOtis subsequently became insane and while confined in an asylum met his\r\ndeath, being struck by a bolt of lightning.\r\n\r\nCharles Paxton was a warden of King's Chapel in 1762, and was remarkable\r\nfor finished politeness and courtesy of manners. His office was\r\nunpopular and odious and the wags of the day made merry with qualities,\r\nwhich at any other time would have commanded respect. On Pope-day, as\r\nthe gun-powder plot anniversary, or the 5th of November was called,\r\nthere was usually a grand pageant of various figures on a stage mounted\r\non wheels and drawn through the streets with horses. The Pretender\r\nsuspended on a gibbet between the Devil and the Pope, with appropriate\r\nimplements and dress, were among the objects devised to make up the\r\nshow. Sometimes political characters, who in popular estimation should\r\nkeep company with personages represented, were added; and of these,\r\nCommissioner Paxton was one. On one occasion he was exhibited between\r\nthe figures of the Devil and the Pope in proper figure. As the disputes\r\nwhich preceded the war increased, the visits of Paxton to London became\r\nmore frequent. He went there as the authorized agent to the crown\r\nofficers, to complain of the merchants for resisting the Acts of\r\nParliament, and for the interest of the supporters of the Crown. After\r\nhe entered upon his duties he was efficient and active beyond his\r\nassociates. John Adams says of him that he appeared at one time to have\r\nbeen Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, Secretary and Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nPaxton and his fellow-commissioners seized one of Hancock's vessels for\r\nsmuggling wine which caused a fearful mob and the flight of the officers\r\nof the revenue to Castle William. Then came the hanging of Paxton in\r\neffigy on the \"Liberty Tree,\" then at the instance of the Commissioner\r\nthe first troops came to Boston; then the card of Otis, denouncing the\r\ncommissioners by name, the assault upon him in answer to it, and later\r\ncame the destruction of three cargoes of tea; then the shutting of the\r\nport of Boston; then the first continental congress; then war,--a war\r\nwhich cost England $500,000,000 and the Anglo-Saxon race 100,000 lives\r\nin battle, storm and in prison.\r\n\r\nIn 1776, with his family of five persons, Mr. Paxton embarked at Boston\r\nwith the British Army for Halifax, and in July of that year sailed for\r\nEngland in the ship Aston Hall. He came under the Confiscation Act and\r\nwas proscribed and banished. In 1780 he was a pallbearer at the funeral\r\nof Governor Hutchinson. In 1781 he was seen walking with Harrison Gray,\r\nthe last Colonial treasurer of Massachusetts, near Brompton. This able\r\nand determined supporter of the crown died in 1788 at the age of\r\neighty-four at the seat of William Burch (one of his fellow\r\ncommissioners) at Norfolk, England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           JOSEPH HARRISON.\r\n\r\n                         COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, after the close of the last war with France which\r\nended in the conquest of Canada, the Government decided on enforcing the\r\nrevenue laws.[212] The frigate Romney of fifty guns had arrived from\r\nHalifax and at the same time the sloop \"Liberty,\" owned by John Hancock,\r\narrived loaded with wine from Madeira; there was a duty of L7 per tun on\r\nsuch wines; several cargoes had been smuggled in without payment of the\r\nduty, and it seemed probable that there would either be a connivance by\r\nthe custom house officer in this case, as in others, or there would be a\r\ngreat disturbance by the mob. Harrison determined that there should be\r\nno connivance by the officers and that the laws against smuggling should\r\nbe enforced, even if the vessel did belong to one of the principal\r\nmerchants and a representative of Boston and an officer of the corps of\r\ncadets. Before the vessel arrived it had been frequently mentioned that\r\nthe duties would not be paid, and it was expected that an open refusal\r\nwould be made. When the vessel arrived and was lying at Hancock's wharf\r\non the tenth of June, 1768, the custom house officer, Thomas Kirk, went\r\non board, and was followed by Captain John Marshall,--who commanded Mr.\r\nHancock's ship, the London Packet,--with five or six others. These\r\npersons confined Kirk below and kept him some three hours, and in the\r\nmeantime the wine was taken out and no entry made of it at the Custom\r\nHouse or Naval Office. The cargo was landed in the night and carted\r\nthrough the streets of Boston under a guard of thirty or forty stout\r\nfellows armed with bludgeons, and though it was notorious to the\r\ngreatest part of the town, no officer of the customs thought fit to\r\nattempt a seizure, nor is it probable that he could have succeeded if he\r\nhad attempted it. On the liberation of the custom house officer, an\r\nentry was made the next morning by the master, Mr. Nathaniel Barnard,\r\nwho entered four or five pipes of wine, and made oath that that was all\r\nhe brought into port. This was as much a submission to the authority of\r\nthe act as if the whole cargo had been seized.\r\n\r\n  [212] Ibid. 33-4, Hutchinson, Vol. III, p. 189.\r\n\r\nIt was determined to seize the sloop upon a charge of false entry.\r\nAccordingly Mr. Joseph Harrison, the collector and Benjamin Hallowell,\r\nthe comptroller, repaired to Hancock's wharf and made the seizure, and\r\nfearing an attempt to rescue the vessel, made a signal to the Romney,\r\nwhich lay at a small distance from the shore, and a boat with armed men\r\ncame to their aid. To prevent a rescue the vessel was taken from the\r\nwharf into the harbor. This removal brought on a riot, a mob was soon\r\ngathered together and the officer, insulted and beaten, several of whom\r\nbarely escaped with their lives. Among the numerous missiles thrown at\r\nMr. Harrison was a brick or stone which struck him on the breast, from\r\nthe effects of which he was confined to his bed. His son, Mr. Richard\r\nAcklom Harrison, was thrown down, dragged by the hair of his head and\r\notherwise barbarously treated. Mr. Hallowell and Mr. Erving, inspectors,\r\ndid not fare much better. The former was confined to his home from the\r\nwounds and bruises he received and the latter besides having his sword\r\nbroken was beaten with clubs and sticks, and considerably wounded. The\r\nmob next proceeded to the home of Mr. John Williams, the\r\nInspector-General, broke his windows and also those of the Comptroller,\r\nMr. Hallowell. They then took Mr. Harrison's boat and dragged it to the\r\nCommon and there burned every fragment of it. Captain Marshall, the\r\ncaptain of the \"London Packet,\" died the same night as the riot, at\r\nHancock wharf, and it is said his death was caused by the over-exertion\r\nwhich he made in removing the wine from the sloop Liberty. The most\r\nconspicuous man on the part of the mob was Captain Daniel Malcolm, a\r\ntrader in Fleet street, who, it is said, was deeply interested in the\r\nwines attempted to be smuggled. The revenue officer knew him well and\r\nowed him no good will, for the reason that some time before they\r\nundertook to search his premises for contraband goods, but were obliged\r\nto retreat before deadly weapons, without effecting their object. On the\r\noccasion of the seizure of the Liberty he headed a party of men who\r\nexerted themselves to prevent her removal to the Romney, they said the\r\nsloop should not be taken into custody, and declared they would go on\r\nboard and throw the people belonging to the Romney overboard.[213] When\r\nthe ministry became advised concerning the riots which followed the\r\nseizure of the sloop Liberty, they gave orders for two regiments to sail\r\nfor Boston from Ireland.[214] They arrived September 30. The 29th\r\nregiment camped on the Common and the 14th was quartered in Faneuil\r\nHall. The revenue officers retired after the assaults upon them to the\r\nCastle until the arrival of the troops. Joseph Harrison and his wife and\r\nfamily went to England. He was succeeded in the collectorship by Edward\r\nWinslow, who held the office till the evacuation of Boston.\r\n\r\n  [213] Drake's History of Boston, pp. 735-6-7.\r\n\r\n  [214] See chapter on Boston Mobs, p. 40.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CAPTAIN MARTIN GAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Gay emigrated to America about 1630. He settled first at Watertown\r\nand was a grantee in the great Dividends and in Beaver Brook plowlands,\r\nowning forty acres. He was Freeman May 6, 1635 and a Selectman in 1654.\r\nHe died March 4, 1688, and his wife Joanna died August 14, 1691. He had\r\neleven children.\r\n\r\nNathaniel, third child of John Gay was born January 11, 1643. Was\r\nFreeman May 23, 1677, and Selectman in 1704 and other years. He married\r\nLydia Lusher. He died Feb. 20, 1712. His wife died August 6th, 1774,\r\naged ninety-two. He had ten children.\r\n\r\nRev. Ebenezer Gay, D. D., Minister of Hingham was born in 1696 graduated\r\nat Harvard University in 1714, and was ordained in 1718. He was a\r\ndevoted loyalist, and died 1787, at the age of ninety, and in the\r\nsixty-ninth year of his ministry. Rev. Doctor Chauncy \"pronounces him to\r\nhave been one of the greatest and most valuable men in the country.\" His\r\nson, MARTIN GAY, was Captain of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery\r\nCompany. He was born at Hingham on the 29 December, 1726. He married\r\nfirst, 13 December, 1750, Mary Pinckney, by whom he had seven children.\r\nAfter her death he married Ruth Atkins, by her he had two children. He\r\ncarried on the business of a brass founder, and copper smith, on Union\r\nStreet, Boston. He was also deacon in the West Church in Lynde Street.\r\nOn the thirtieth of April, 1775, shortly after the battle of Lexington,\r\nDeacon Gay, with Deacon Jones was requested to \"take care of the plate,\r\netc., belonging to this church, and Congregation.\" The church and\r\ncongregation were at this time dispersed and the meeting house occupied\r\nas a barrack by the troops, and the pastor had gone to Nova Scotia. Mr.\r\nGay was true to his trust, at the evacuation he took \"the plate and\r\nlinnen\" to Nova Scotia and afterwards returned it, for long years after\r\nin 1793 the church voted him their thanks for \"having taken care of the\r\nplate belonging to the church, while the town was in the hands of the\r\nBritish troops, and when it was evacuated.\" When the new church was\r\nbuilt in 1805 he subscribed three hundred dollars towards it. From 1758\r\nto 1774, he was yearly chosen one of the two Assay Masters, and for many\r\nyears he was chosen one of the sixteen Firewards of the Town, in which\r\noffice he had as associates John Hancock, Samuel Adams, and Adino\r\nPaddock, he was chosen one of the twelve Wardens of the Town in 1771,\r\nand occupied many other offices of importance, which shows the esteem in\r\nwhich he was held by his fellow townsmen. In June, 1774, he signed the\r\nAddress to Governor Hutchinson, and from that time, he was not elected\r\nto any town office, owing to his public avowal of Loyalist sentiments.\r\n\r\nMr. W. Allan Gay of West Hingham, a grandson of Martin Gay, has three\r\nletters written by the Captain, they have been published in the\r\nCollection of the Colonial Society of Mass., Vol. 3. They are\r\ninteresting as they bring us almost into personal contact with people\r\nwho were living in Boston more than a hundred years ago, and one of whom\r\nsaw the Battle of Bunker Hill. The first was written by Captain Martin\r\nGay to his brother Jotham, seven years his elder. He had been an officer\r\nin the French war of 1755 and had taken part in the expedition against\r\nNova Scotia under Gen. John Winslow. He afterwards settled in the\r\nprovince he had helped to conquer from the French and at the date of the\r\nletter had been for more than ten years a resident of Cumberland, Nova\r\nScotia. Within but three weeks after the battle, it gives one of the\r\nfirst authentic accounts published. The writer's loyalty to his \"King\r\nand Country\" is very apparent, as well as his detestation of all Rebels,\r\nand especially the \"famous Doctor Warren.\" The letter in part is as\r\nfollows: \"The victory obtained by about two thousand regular troops\r\ncommanded by General Howe, over a large body of the County Rebels, ('tis\r\nsaid about six thousand,) on the heights of Charlestown, on the 17ult,\r\nwas a remarkable Action. It proves that nothing the enemies to Great\r\nBritain can do, will daunt the courage of British troops. The Rebels had\r\nentrenched themselves on the top of a high hill, with two cannon mounted\r\nin the Redoubt, besides several field pieces, on the hill, which is\r\nabout a quarter of a mile from Charles River in approaching which, the\r\ntroops had to break through stone walls, and other difficulties, which\r\ngave the enemy every advantage they could wish for. However, after a\r\nmost violent hot fire, the brave soldiers forced the entrenchments to\r\nthe joy of all the spectators, (myself being one) and others on this\r\nside of the river, who are friends to King and Country. Immediately on\r\nthe King's troops appearing on the top of the Redoubt, the Rebels ran\r\noff in great confusion leaving their cannon, entrenching tools and a\r\nlarge number of their dead and wounded. The loss was great on both\r\nsides, the action lasted about an hour and a quarter. We have reason to\r\nlament the loss of so many valuable brave officers and men, of the\r\nKing's Army who were killed on the field of battle, and since dead of\r\nthe wounds they received. I have not seen any account of the transaction\r\nof that day made public by authority, therefore will not pretend to say\r\nwhich suffered most in the loss of men. Will mention one on the Rebel\r\nside, the famous Doctor Warren, who has for some years been a stirrer up\r\nof Rebellion, was killed in the action. Had some others of his\r\ndisposition which I could name been there, and meet the same fate with\r\nhim, it would have made the victory of that day the more glorious,\r\nthough the Rebels meet with a shameful defeat, they still continue in\r\ntheir opposition, in fortifying hills and others places near this town.\r\nI am not apprehensive of their ever being able to take or destroy this\r\ntown, but 'tis a melancholy consideration to be in this situation, which\r\nmust in time prove fatal to this town and province, if not soon\r\nprevented by that almighty being, whose providence preserves and governs\r\nthe world in all things.\"\r\n\r\nOn the evacuation of Boston in March, 1776, by the British troops, he\r\naccompanied them to Halifax. There went with him his son Martin, and his\r\ndaughter Mary, who afterwards married Rev. William Black of Halifax, and\r\nalso \"his man London.\" He remained in Nova Scotia during the whole\r\nperiod of the war. Mrs. Ruth Gay, second wife of Martin Gay, whose\r\nmaiden name as already stated was Atkins, remained in Boston during the\r\nwar, probably with her father's family. Her father, Thomas Atkins, was a\r\nbricklayer by trade, and a well-to-do citizen, his real estate having\r\nbeen appraised at his death in 1785 at L1,696. He, with his eldest son,\r\njoined the revolutionists, but his second son, Gibbs Atkins, was a\r\nloyalist. So were families divided in those days.\r\n\r\nThe second letter was from his wife in Boston and was sent to him at\r\nHalifax. It is interesting as showing some of the devices reported to by\r\nthe loyalists, their families and friends to save at least a portion of\r\ntheir estates for the original owners. The letter is as follows:\r\n\r\n                                               Boston, 24 June, 1786.\r\n\r\n     My Dear Mr. Gay:\r\n\r\n     My last of the 8th instant containing the melancholy account of the\r\n     death of my father, I make no doubt you have received. In that I\r\n     also informed you that the house was to be sold the 15 of this\r\n     month which was done accordingly. Mr. Whalley chose to bid it of\r\n     and Brother Timothy bought it at L380. He paid 129 Dollars Earnest\r\n     money, the rest is to be paid in 6 weeks. I wish you could settle\r\n     your affairs so as to come home before the time is up. Mr. Whalley\r\n     has sent you the account of the sale properly authentic, and has\r\n     directed them to be left at Mr. Pike's at Halifax. Do come home as\r\n     soon as you can. Our friends unite with me in love to you and\r\n     children. Father Gay has got quite well. Fanny is with me and\r\n     desires her duty to you. Love to her Brothers and Sisters. Believe\r\n     me to be your tender, affectionate Wife,\r\n\r\n                                                      R. GAY.\r\n\r\nThe sale mentioned by Mrs. Gay took place under the Confiscation Act of\r\n1777-1780. These estates were treated by the Probate Court as those of\r\ndeceased persons. As Martin Gay's wife was not an absentee she was\r\nentitled to her third or dower right in her husband's estate. The\r\nCommissioners appointed by the Probate Court assigned to Mrs. Gay as\r\n\"her third\" \"the two middle tenements of the house on Union Street,\r\nBoston, with the cellars chambers and upper rooms. Also the shop\r\nfronting Union Street and the land under same with the liberty to go\r\nthrough the great entry into the said shop, with the use and\r\nimprovements of the yard, Well, Pump, and Privy.\" This division was made\r\nat her request as a shrewd means of retaining for herself and eventually\r\nfor her husband, the _whole_ of the property, for it would be difficult\r\nto sell or to lease the two ends of the house so divided, with the\r\nmiddle taken out. The result was that the remainder of the house was\r\nunsaleable and as stated in the letter was bought in by her brother\r\nTimothy Atkins. As Mrs. Gay by her right of dower had only a life estate\r\non the property, it was necessary that she should require what is known\r\nas the \"remainder\" which was still vested in the Commonwealth. This was\r\nconveyed to her by Act of the Legislature, Feb. 7th, 1807, for the\r\nconsideration $1,680. In 1809, the widow, Ruth Gay, and her son Ebenezer\r\nGay, sold this property for fifteen thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThe third letter is dated at London, 7 July, 1788. In it he says \"I\r\ncannot pretend to say when my affairs will admit of my return to\r\nAmerica. By a late act of parliament a final settlement will (it is\r\nsayed) be made with the Loyalists within a few months. I must wait with\r\npatience this important event, then prepare to leave this both wonderful\r\nand delightful kingdom, and return to my family and friends in my native\r\ncountry, though an Alien when in it.\"\r\n\r\nHe remained two years in England and returned to Boston in 1792, when he\r\nresumed his business as a coppersmith at his old stand in Union Street,\r\nand soon after entered into business relations with Mr. James Davis, a\r\nbrass founder, then but twenty-two years of age, who had learned the\r\ntrade from a Hessian, who like many of his countrymen were obliged to\r\nremain in the country when Congress violated the terms of the Saratoga\r\nConvention.[215] Mr. Gay subsequently sold the business to Mr. Davis,\r\nwho incorporated it in 1828 under the name of the Revere Copper Company,\r\nMr. Joseph Warren Revere being one of the incorporators.\r\n\r\n  [215] See page 85 for further account of the Saratoga Convention.\r\n\r\nMartin Gay died in 1809, and he was buried in the Granary Burial Ground.\r\nSAMUEL GAY was the eldest son of Martin Gay who graduated at Harvard in\r\n1775. Owing to the disturbed state of the times, and the quarterings of\r\nthe rebel troops in the College buildings, he did not take his degree at\r\nthe College Commencement, which was not held this year. He became a\r\npermanent resident of New Brunswick, and was a member of the first House\r\nof Assembly organized in the Colony, and represented the County of\r\nWestmoreland several years. He was also a magistrate of that County, and\r\nChief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas. He died at Fort Cumberland\r\n(where his father had a grant of land from the Crown) January 21, 1847\r\nin the ninety-third year of his age.\r\n\r\nEBENEZER GAY was the youngest son of Martin Gay, and can hardly be\r\nclassed as a loyalist. He was a child when his father went to Halifax,\r\nand he remained in Boston with his mother during the war. He graduated\r\nat Harvard College in 1789, practiced law, and was a member of the State\r\nSenate, and resided at Hingham. Mr. Wickworth Allen Gay, the artist, is\r\nhis son. Martin Gay the younger, was fifteen years of age when he\r\naccompanied his father to Halifax. Three years later he was accidentally\r\nshot by a friend while hunting near Windsor, Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LIST OF CONFISCATED ESTATES BELONGING TO MARTIN GAY IN SUFFOLK COUNTY\r\n                              AND TO WHOM SOLD.\r\n\r\n     To John Davis.

The three sons were\r\nJames, Henry, and Philip, all of whom have left many descendants. The\r\nLeonards were interested in the first iron works established in this\r\ncountry at Lynn, Braintree, Rowley Village, and Taunton, and at a later\r\ndate at Canton, so that the observation \"where you can find iron works\r\nthere you will find a Leonard\" has been almost literally verified. They\r\nwere probably interested in most, if not all the iron works established\r\nin this country within the first century after its settlement, and it is\r\na remarkable fact that the iron manufacture has continued successively,\r\nand generally very successfully, in the hand of the Leonards or their\r\ndescendants, down to the present day.\r\n\r\nJames was the progenitor of the Leonards of Taunton, Raynham and Norton.\r\nHe and his sons often traded with the Indians, and were on such terms of\r\nfriendship with them, that when war broke out King Philip gave strict\r\norders to his men never to hurt the Leonards. Philip resided in winter\r\nat Mount Hope, but his summer residence was at Raynham, about a mile\r\nfrom the forge. The family was noted throughout Plymouth County in\r\nColonial times for its wealth, and the number of able men it produced in\r\nsuccessive generations, who were entrusted by the public with offices of\r\nhonor and importance. To this family belonged Daniel Leonard, the third\r\nTaunton lawyer, a man who was no unconspicuous actor in the affairs of\r\nhis time. He was the only son of Ephraim Leonard, a judge of the Court\r\nof Common Pleas, a colonel in the militia, and the possessor of a large\r\nproperty, who resided on a homestead of five hundred acres connected\r\nwith which were extensive iron works, situated in that part of the town\r\nof Norton now known as Mansfield. There, in a house on this estate the\r\nsubject of this sketch was born May 29, 1740. His boyhood was passed\r\ntranquilly amid comforts which usually wait on an only child of wealthy\r\nand influential parents. Entering Harvard College at an early age, he\r\ngraduated in 1760 in the class of John Lowell, the celebrated lawyer. He\r\ntook up law as a profession, and had not been long at the bar before he\r\nwas engaged in a fair practice, his generous disposition and affable\r\nmanners having established his popularity, while his acquirements won\r\nfor him reputation as an orator and a scholar. In 1770 he received from\r\nYale College the degree of M. A.; in 1769 he was appointed as King's\r\nAttorney of Bristol County. Having become possessed of a fortune by a\r\nBoston heiress, he adopted what for that age and vicinity was considered\r\ngreat style, and display of dress, and mode of living. He set up a\r\nchariot, and pair of horses with which he travelled to Boston several\r\ntimes a week, something no lawyer in the Province had ever ventured to\r\ndo before. In 1769 he began his political career by entering the\r\nLegislature where he represented Taunton during the year's of 1770-71-73\r\nand 74. At first he made the most ardent speeches, which had been up to\r\nthat time delivered in the House against Great Britain in favor of the\r\ncolonists, but in the latter years of his service as a representative,\r\nhe, like many more of his countrymen, became alarmed at the mob\r\noutrages, and the drifting of the country towards rebellion, he slowly\r\nchanged his opinions and became a Loyalist and a supporter of the\r\ngovernment that represented law, and authority. The revolutionists\r\nattributed this change to the influence of Governor Hutchinson and\r\nAttorney-General Sewall with whom he was on terms of intimacy, although\r\nthis friendship formed some cause of distrust; the change in his views\r\nwas not known publicly, or with certainty until the summer of 1774, as\r\nis evidenced by his being a member of the Committee of Nine on the state\r\nof the Province in the Legislature of that year, a committee made up of\r\nthose only who were believed to be against the government. In June of\r\nthat year he became an \"addresser\" to Governor Hutchinson. A few weeks\r\nlater he was appointed Mandamus Councellor by the King. When it became\r\nknown that he had taken the oath for qualifications for this office a\r\nmob of upward of two thousand men gathered on the \"green\" near his home,\r\nuttering oaths and angry threats and menacing him with personal\r\nindignities, which they would undoubtedly have proceeded to put into\r\nexecution if they could have found him, but being informed by his father\r\nthat he had gone to Boston and that he would use his influence to induce\r\nhis son to resign his office, they were mollified for the time and\r\nrefrained from pulling the house down, and gradually dispersed. They,\r\nhowever, assembled again the following evening, and seeing a light in\r\nthe south chamber where Mrs. Leonard lay sick in bed, and thinking that\r\nLeonard was there, they fired through the window into the room; the\r\nbullets passed through the upper sash and shutter, and lodged in the\r\npartition of the next chamber.[216] Friends had acquainted Mr. Leonard\r\nof the mob's intention to attack his home. He therefore went to Boston\r\nwhere his family soon joined him, and was protected from further\r\nviolence by the presence of the troops. This outrage upon his home\r\ngreatly embittered him against the revolutionists and their cause, and\r\nwas undoubtedly the cause of his writing his celebrated letters, which\r\nso ably championed those principles of civil liberty, for which the\r\nloyalists so nobly contended.\r\n\r\n  [216] Mrs. Leonard was confined to bed with childbirth. Charles, their\r\n  only son, was born an idiot, due no doubt to this outrage. The mother of\r\n  Curtis Guild, the present governor of Massachusetts, was born in this\r\n  room, she being a descendant of the Leonard family.\r\n\r\nDaniel Leonard was the author of the famous letters signed\r\nMassachusettensis, mis-attributed by the first President Adams to\r\nJonathan Sewall. These letters that appeared in the Massachusetts\r\nGazette \"reviewed with much ingenuity with the purpose of showing that\r\nthe course of the government was founded in law and reason; that the\r\ncolonies had no substantial grievance; that they were a part of the\r\nBritish Empire and properly subject to its authority.\" From the great\r\nskill in which they were written they were attributed to Jonathan\r\nSewall, a man of much talent. It was more than a generation before the\r\nauthorship was assigned to Daniel Leonard. John Adams answered these\r\npapers as \"Novanglus.\" \"Massachusettensis\" bears dates between December,\r\n1774, and April, 1775, and was published three times in a single year:\r\nfirst, in the \"Massachusetts Gazette and Post Boy,\" next in a pamphlet\r\nform; and last, by Rivington, in New York. Still another edition\r\nappeared in Boston in 1776. The replies were numerous. \"Novanglus\" bears\r\ndates between January and April, 1775. Both were printed in 1819, with a\r\npreface, by Mr. Adams, who remarks of \"Massachusettensis,\" that \"these\r\npapers were well written, abounded with wit, discovered good\r\ninformation, and were conducted with a subtlety of art and address\r\nwonderfully calculated to keep up the spirits of their party, to depress\r\nours,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThe following are a few brief extracts from these letters.\r\n\r\n\"The press when opened to all parties and influenced by none, is a\r\nsalutary engine in a free state, to preserve the freedom of that state,\r\nbut when a party has gained the ascendancy, so far as to become the\r\nlicensers of the press, either by act of government, or by playing off\r\nthe resentment of the populace against printers, and authors, the press\r\nitself becomes an engine of oppression or licentiousness, and is as\r\npernicious to society as otherwise it would be beneficial. It is too\r\ntrue that ever since the origin of our controversy with Great Britain,\r\nthe press of this town have been indulged in publishing what they\r\npleased, while little has been published on the part of the government.\r\nThe effect this must have had upon the minds of the people in general is\r\nobvious. In short, the changes have been so often rung upon oppression,\r\ntyranny, and slavery, that, whether sleeping or waking, they are\r\ncontinually vibrating in our ears, and it is now high time to ask\r\nourselves whether we have not been deluded by sound only. Should you be\r\ntold that acts of high treason are flagrant through the country, that a\r\ngreat part of the province is in actual rebellion, would you believe it\r\ntrue? Nay, you would spurn it with indignation. Be calm, my friends, it\r\nis necessary to know the worst of a disease, to enable us to provide an\r\neffectual remedy. Are not the bands of society cut asunder and the\r\nsanctions that hold man to man trampled upon? Can any of us recover a\r\ndebt, or obtain compensation for an injury by law? Are not many persons,\r\nwhom once we respected, and revered, driven from their homes, and\r\nfamilies, and forced to fly to the army for protection, for no other\r\nreason but their having accepted commissions under our king? Is not\r\ncivil government dissolved?\r\n\r\n\"Reader, apply to an honest lawyer (if such a one can be found) and\r\ninquire what kind of an offence it is for a number of armed men to\r\nassemble, and forcibly to obstruct the courts of justice, to pass\r\ngovernmental acts, to take the militia out of the hands of the king's\r\nrepresentatives to form a new militia, to raise men and appoint officers\r\nfor public purposes, without order or permission of the king or his\r\nrepresentatives, or for a number of men to take to their arms, and march\r\nwith a professed design of opposing the king's troops. Ask, reader, of\r\nsuch a lawyer, what is the crime, and what the punishment, and if,\r\nperchance, thou art one that has been active in these things, and art\r\nnot insensibility itself, his answer will harrow up thy soul.\r\n\r\n\"The shaft is already sped, and the utmost exertion is necessary to\r\nprevent the blow. We already feel the effects of anarchy, mutual\r\nconfidence, affection, and tranquility, those sweeteners of human life\r\nare succeeded by distrust, hatred, and wild uproar; the useful arts of\r\nagriculture and commerce are neglected for caballing, mobbing this or\r\nthe other man, because he acts, speaks or is suspected of thinking\r\ndifferent from the prevailing sentiment of the times, in purchasing\r\narms, and forming a militia. O height of madness! Can you indulge the\r\nthought one moment that Great Britain will consent to this? For what has\r\nshe protected and defended the colonies against the maritime powers of\r\nEurope, from their first British settlement to this day? For what did\r\nshe purchase New York of the Dutch? For what was she so lavish of her\r\nbest blood and treasure in the conquest of Canada, and other territories\r\nin America? Was it to raise up a rival state, or to enlarge her own\r\nempire? I mention these things, my friends, that you may know how people\r\nreason upon this subject in England, and to convince you that you are\r\ndeceived, if you imagine, that Great Britain will accede to the claims\r\nof the colonies. And now, in God's name, what is it that has brought us\r\nto this brink of destruction? Has not the government of Great Britain\r\nbeen as mild and equitable in the colonies, as in any part of her\r\nextensive domains? Has she not been a nursing mother to us from the days\r\nof our infancy to this time. Has she not been indulgent almost to a\r\nfault?\r\n\r\n\"I have as yet said nothing of the difference in sentiment among\r\nourselves. Upon a superficial view we might imagine that this province\r\nwas nearly unanimous; but the case is far different. A very considerable\r\nbody of men of property in this province are at this day firmly attached\r\nto the cause of government, bodies of men compelling persons to disavow\r\ntheir sentiments, to resign commissions or to subscribe leagues, and\r\ncovenants, has wrought no change in their sentiments. It has only\r\nattached them more closely to government and pray more devoutly for its\r\nrestoration.\r\n\r\n\"A new, and until lately unheard of mode of opposition, has been devised,\r\nsaid to be the invention of the fertile brain of one of our party\r\nagents, called a committee of correspondence. This is the foulest,\r\nsubtlest, and most venomous serpent that ever issued from the eggs of\r\nsedition. These committees when once established, think themselves\r\namenable to none, they assume a dictatorial style, and have an\r\nopportunity under the apparent sanction of their several towns, of\r\nclandestinely wreaking private revenge on individuals by traducing their\r\ncharacters, and holding them up as enemies of their country, wherever\r\nthey go, also of misrepresenting facts and propagating sedition through\r\nthe country. Thus a man of principle and property in travelling through\r\nthe country would be insulted by persons whose faces he had never seen\r\nbefore. He would feel the smart without suspecting the hand that\r\nadministered the blow. These committees, as they are not known in law,\r\nand can derive no authority from thence. They frequently erect\r\nthemselves into a tribunal where the same persons are at once\r\nlegislators, accusers, witnesses, judges, and jurors and the mob the\r\nexecutioners. The accused has no day in court, and the execution of the\r\nsentence is the first notice he receives. It is chiefly owning to these\r\ncommittees, that so many respectable persons have been abused and forced\r\nto sign recantations and resignation though so many persons, to avoid\r\nsuch reiterated insults, as are more to be deprecated by a man of\r\nsentiment than death itself, have been obliged to quit their houses,\r\nfamilies and business, and fly to the army for protection. That husband\r\nhas been separated from wife, father from son, brother from brother, and\r\nthe unfortunate refugee forced to abandon all the comforts of domestic\r\nlife. Have not these people that are thus insulted, as good a right to\r\nthink and act for themselves in matters of the last importance. Why\r\nthen, do you suffer them to be cruelly treated for differing in\r\nsentiment from you? Perhaps by this time some of you may inquire who it\r\nis, that suffers his pen to run so freely. I will tell you; it is a\r\nnative of this province that knew it before many that are now basking in\r\nthe rays of political sunshine, had a being. He was favored not by\r\nwhigs, or tories, but the people. He is now repaying your favors, if he\r\nknows his own heart, from the purest gratitude. I saw the small seed of\r\nsedition when it was implanted; it was as a grain of mustard. I have\r\nwatched the plant until it has become a great tree; the vilest reptiles\r\nthat crawl upon the earth are concealed at the root, the foulest birds\r\nof the air rest upon its branches.\r\n\r\n\"At the conclusion of the late war Great Britain found that the national\r\ndebt amounted to almost one hundred and fifty million, and heavy taxes\r\nand duties were laid. She knew that the colonies were as much benefited\r\nas any part of the empire, and indeed more so, she thought it reasonable\r\nthat the colonies should bear a part of the national burden, as that\r\nthey should share in the national benefit. For this purpose the stamp\r\nact was passed. At first we did not dream of denying the authority of\r\nparliament to tax us, much less legislate for us. We had paid for\r\nestablishing a post office, duties imposed for regulating trade, and\r\neven for raising a revenue to the crown without questioning the right.\r\nSome resolves in Virginia denying the right of parliament made their\r\nappearance. We read them with wonder, they savoured of independence. It\r\nnow became unpopular to suggest the contrary, his life would be in\r\ndanger that asserted it. The newspapers were open to but one side of the\r\nquestion and the inflammatory pieces that issued weekly from the press,\r\nworked up the populace to a fit temper to commit the outrages that\r\nensued. It has been said that several thousands were expended in\r\nEngland, to ferment the disturbance there. However that may be,\r\nopposition to the ministry was then gaining ground, from circumstances\r\nforeign to this. The ministry was changed and the stamp act repealed.\r\nWhen the statute was made imposing duties upon glass, paper, India teas,\r\netc. imported into the colonies, it was said this was another instance\r\nof taxation. We obtained a partial repeal of this statute which took off\r\nthe duties from all articles except teas. We could not complain of the\r\nthree-penny duty on tea as burdensome, for a shilling which had been\r\nlaid upon it for the purpose of regulating trade, and therefore was\r\nallowed to be constitutional, was taken off; so that we were, in fact,\r\ngainers nine pence on the pound by the new regulation. The people were\r\ntold weekly that the ministry had formed a plan to enslave them that the\r\nduty upon tea was only a prelude to a window tax, hearth tax, land tax\r\nand poll tax, etc. What was it natural to expect from a people bred\r\nunder a free constitution, jealous of their liberty, credulous, even to\r\na proverb when told their privileges were in danger. I answer outrages,\r\ndisgraceful to humanity itself. What mischief was not an artful man, who\r\nhad obtained the confidence and guidance of such an enraged multitude,\r\ncapable of doing? He had only to point out this or that man, as an enemy\r\nof his country, and no character or station, age or merit could protect\r\nthe proscribed from their fury. Happy was it for him, if he could\r\nsecrete his person, and subject his property only to their lawless rage.\r\nBy such means acts of public violence has been committed as will blacken\r\nmany a page in the history of our country. They have engrossed all the\r\npower of the province into their own hands. A democracy or republic it\r\nhas been called, but it does not deserve the name of either. It was,\r\nhowever, a despotism cruelly carried into execution by mobs, and riots,\r\nand more incompatible with the rights of mankind than the enormous\r\nmonarchies of the East. The government under the British Constitution\r\nconsisting of kings, lords, and commons, is allowed both by Englishmen\r\nand foreigners to be the most perfect system that the wisdom of ages has\r\nproduced. The distributions of power are so just, and the proportions so\r\nexact, as at once to support and control each other. An Englishman\r\nglories in being subject to and protected by such a government.\r\n\r\n\"Let us now suppose the colonies united and moulded into some form of\r\ngovernment, in order to render government operative and salutary,\r\nsubordination is necessary. This our patriots need not be told of, and\r\nwhen once they had mounted the steed and found themselves so well seated\r\nas to run no risk of being thrown from the saddle, the severity of their\r\ndiscipline to restore subordination would be in proportion to their\r\nformer treachery in destroying it. We have already seen specimens of\r\ntheir tyranny, in the inhuman treatment of persons guilty of no crime\r\nexcept that of differing in sentiment. What then must we expect from\r\nsuch scourges of mankind when supported by imperial powers?\r\n\r\n\"I do not address myself to whigs or tories, but to the whole people. I\r\nknow you well, you are loyal at heart, friends to good order, and do\r\nviolence to yourselves in harboring one moment, disrespectful sentiments\r\ntowards Great Britain, the land of our forefathers' nativity, and sacred\r\nrepository of their bones, but you have been most insidiously induced to\r\nbelieve that Britain is rapacious, cruel and vindictive, and envies us\r\nthe inheritance purchased by the sweat and blood of our ancestors. Could\r\nthat thick mist be but once dispelled that you might see our Sovereign,\r\nthe provident father of all his people, and Great Britain a nursing\r\nmother to the colonies, as they really are. Long live our gracious king,\r\nand happiness to Britain would resound from one end of the province to\r\nthe other.\"[217]\r\n\r\n  [217] Extracts from Massachusettensis. Letter addressed to the\r\n  Inhabitants of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, Dec. 12th, 1774.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1775, Daniel Leonard was appointed Solicitor General of the\r\nCommission of Customs with a salary of L200 sterling, a body exercising\r\npowers similar to those of a court of admiralty. Thirteen months after\r\nthis time, March, 1776, he accompanied the British Army to Halifax with\r\nhis family of eight persons and thence to London, where he practiced as\r\na barrister in the Courts of Westminster.\r\n\r\nIn 1780, William Knox, Under Secretary of State for the American\r\nDepartment suggested the division of Maine, and a province of the\r\nterritory between the Penobscot and St. Croix rivers, with Thomas Oliver\r\nfor Governor, and Daniel Leonard for Chief Justice. The plan was\r\napproved by the King and Ministry, but was abandoned because Wederburne,\r\nthe Attorney-General, gave the opinion that the whole of Maine was\r\nincluded in the charter of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nMr. Leonard was in Massachusetts in 1799 and again in 1808. He was\r\nincluded in the Banishment Act of 1778 and the Conspiracy Act of 1779.\r\nHe received the appointment of Chief Justice to Bermuda. After filling\r\nthis office for many years, he again in his last days took up his\r\nresidence in London, where he died June 27, 1829, aged 89. His death was\r\nthe result of an accident while withdrawing the charge from a pistol, he\r\naccidentally discharging it so as to cause almost instant death.\r\n\r\nThe generous temper and affable manners of Mr. Leonard seemed to have\r\nfascinated those who were in his household. The nurse who was entrusted\r\nwith the care of the infant daughter of his first wife, would never\r\nleave him. She went with his family in all their wanderings, first to\r\nBoston, then to Halifax, London, and Bermuda, then to the United States,\r\nback again to the West Indies, then to London, and died in their\r\nservice. His Deputy Sheriff, who had been a Captain in the Provincial\r\nservice, a person of great address, wit, and accomplishments, followed\r\nhis fortunes and was killed in the battle of Germantown, then a Major in\r\nthe British Army. A young gentleman educated at Harvard College, and in\r\nhis office, went with him to London where he died.\r\n\r\nDaniel Leonard married twice. His first wife was Anna, daughter of Hon.\r\nSamuel White of Taunton, his second Sarah Hammock of Boston, who died on\r\nthe passage from Bermuda to Providence, R. I., aged 78. He left a\r\ndaughter Anna, who married a Mr. Smith of Antigua, Harriet who died in\r\nLondon in 1849, Sarah who married John Stewart, a captain in British\r\narmy and afterwards Collector of the Port of Bermuda. Sarah had four\r\nchildren. The eldest Duncan Stewart, on the death of an uncle who died\r\nchildless, succeeded to an ancient Lairdship in Scotland. His brother,\r\nLeonard Stewart, was an eminent physician in London. His sister Emily\r\nmarried a Captain in the service of the East India Company, the other\r\nsister, Sarah, married a Mr. Winslow, descended from the ancient\r\ngovernor of Plymouth, and a relative of Lord Lyndhurst, (Copley) whose\r\nprivate Secretary he was during his Chancellorship.[218] Mr. Leonard had\r\nan only son Charles, who was born when the mob attacked his house, and\r\nwas feeble-minded. He entered Harvard College in 1791, but did not\r\ngraduate. He was subsequently under the guardianship of Judge Wheaton,\r\nand was found dead in the road in Barrowsville, near Taunton in 1831.\r\nCol. Ephraim Leonard, who lived till the close of the Revolution devised\r\nhis large estate to his grandson Charles. It was understood, however,\r\nthat the father and sisters of Charles were to participate in the\r\nenjoyment of the property. Had Daniel Leonard returned from banishment\r\nand taken the oath of naturalization and allegiance to the new\r\ngovernment, he would have inherited this large estate, but this he would\r\nnot do, nothing could swerve him from his loyalty to the old flag.\r\n\r\n  [218] Genealogical Memoir of the Leonard Family, by William R. Deane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            JUDGE GEORGE LEONARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor George Leonard was the third in descent from James, the immigrant.\r\nHe removed in 1690 to Norton, then a part of Taunton, where he became\r\nthe proprietor of very large tracts of land, and was in fact the founder\r\nof that town. Here this family, as possessors of great wealth and of the\r\nlargest landed estate probably of any in New England, have lived for\r\nover two hundred years. Major George was Judge of the Court of Common\r\nPleas. His eldest son George, the subject of this sketch, was born March\r\n4, 1698. He was in office from early manhood until old age. He served\r\nhis town in nearly every capacity and was appointed a judge of the Court\r\nof Common Pleas, in 1725; a member of the Council in 1741; and Judge of\r\nProbate in 1747; while in the Militia he rose to rank of Colonel. In\r\n1740 he was dismissed from the bench, in consequence of his connection\r\nwith the famous Land Bank scheme, but was restored six years afterwards,\r\nand became Chief Justice. He was called a \"neutral\" by Clark the\r\nhistorian of Norton, and he remarks that though the most influential man\r\nin town he took no active part in public affairs during the war. A\r\n_neutral_ in the Revolution was a Loyalist, the Revolutionists did not\r\nallow such a thing as a \"neutral\" to exist. The fact was that he was an\r\nold man, whom all classes respected, and on that account they did not\r\nmolest him, and drive him out.\r\n\r\nHe died in 1778, in his eighty-first year. \"Tradition,\" says Clark, \"has\r\nuniversally given him a character above reproach, and of sterling\r\nworth.\" He married Rachel Clap, of Scituate, who bore him four children\r\nand who died in 1783, in her eighty-second year.\r\n\r\nGeorge Leonard, son of the former, was born in 1729, and graduated at\r\nHarvard University in 1748. He held several important offices under the\r\nColonial government, and after the adoption of the Federal Constitution,\r\nwas a member of Congress. It is said \"he was a genuine specimen of an\r\nAmerican country gentleman,\" that \"he was a kind and considerate\r\nlandlord, who never raised his rents, and who regarded his old tenants\r\nas his friends,\" that \"he was tenaciously attached to old customs, and\r\nwore the short breeches and long stockings to the day of his death.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        COLONEL GEORGE LEONARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nWas the son of Rev. Nathaniel Leonard the brother of Judge Leonard and\r\nfifth in descent from James the immigrant. He was driven forth from his\r\nnative land and settled in New Brunswick in 1783, and was much employed\r\nin public affairs. The year after his arrival, he was appointed one of\r\nthe agents of government to locate lands granted to Loyalists, and was\r\nsoon after made a member of the Council, and commissioned as a Colonel\r\nin the militia. He died at Sussex Vale in 1826, at an old age. His wife\r\nSarah, died a year before aged eighty-one. He had several children. His\r\ndaughter Caroline married R. M. Jarvis, Esq., in 1805, and his daughter\r\nMaria married Lieutenant Gustavus Rochfort of the Royal Navy in 1814.\r\nHis son, Colonel Richard Leonard of the 104th Regiment of the British\r\narmy and Sheriff of the District of Niagara, died at Lundy's Lane in\r\n1833.\r\n\r\nGEORGE LEONARD, JR., son of George Leonard, accompanied his father to\r\nNew Brunswick in 1783. He was a grantee of the city of St. John. He was\r\nbred to the law, and devoted himself to his profession. He died at\r\nSussex Vale in 1818.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            HARRISON GRAY.\r\n\r\n                   RECEIVER GENERAL OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHarrison Gray, was the son of Edward Gray and his wife Susanna. He was\r\nborn in Boston, 24 February, 1711.\r\n\r\nEdward Gray was from Lancashire, England, was an apprentice in Boston in\r\n1686, and married Susanna Harrison in 1699, by whom he had several\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nHarrison Gray was bred a merchant. His patrimonial inheritance, aided by\r\nindustry, enabled him to acquire a handsome fortune. In June 1753, he\r\nwas chosen Treasurer of the province by the General Court and continued\r\nin that office till October, 1774. He was an ardent loyalist, and\r\nadhered to government from the beginning of the controversy, but the\r\nmodification of his conduct, his superior fitness for the office and the\r\nconfidence in his integrity secured him public favor through the stormy\r\nperiod which commenced soon after his first election, and continued\r\nuntil his appointment to, and acceptance of, the office of mandamus\r\ncounsellor in 1774. But this was an unpardonable offence in the eyes of\r\nthe \"sons of despotism.\" It was however unsolicited, unexpected, and\r\naccepted with great reluctance, being strongly pressed upon him by the\r\nleaders of the loyalist party; and as most of those who had been\r\nappointed his colleagues living in the country were compelled by the\r\nmobs to decline the office, he was led to believe that residing in\r\nBoston then garrisoned by the troops, he had no such apology for\r\nshrinking from the service, and accordingly sacrificed inclination to a\r\nconscientious sense of duty. This brought upon him the ill will and\r\nmalice of his political opponents, among these was John Adams, who said,\r\n\"I went in to take a pipe with brother Cranch and there I found Zab\r\nAdams. He told me he heard that I had made two very powerful enemies in\r\nthis town, and lost two very valuable clients--Treasurer Gray, and\r\nEzekiel Goldthwaite; and that he had heard that Gray had been to me for\r\nmy account, and paid it off, and determined to have nothing more to do\r\nwith me. O the wretched, impotent malice! they show their teeth--they\r\nare eager to bite--but they have not strength. I despise their anger,\r\ntheir resentment, and their threats; but I can tell Mr. Treasurer that I\r\nhave it in my power to tell the world a tale which will infallibly\r\nunhorse him, whether I am in the house or out. If this province knew\r\nthat the public money had never been counted these twenty years, and\r\nthat no bonds were given last year, nor for several years before, there\r\nwould be so much uneasiness about it that Mr. Treasurer would lose his\r\nelection another year.\" This was one of the meanest and most\r\ncontemptible statements John Adams ever made. It was a reckless\r\naccusation, and insinuation, and was ably answered by his grandson,\r\nHarrison Gray Otis, who prepared a clear refutation of the unjust\r\naccusation in Russell's Centinel, June, 1830. It was also refuted by\r\nsubsequent events. In October, 1774, the royal government was\r\nsuperseded by the revolutionary congress who resolved \"_that no more\r\ntaxes be paid to him_,\" and made choice of Henry Gardner for his\r\nsuccessor. This authority he could not be expected to recognize. He\r\ntherefore retained the books and files at his office till the evacuation\r\nof Boston, and then left them in exemplary order. They are still in the\r\npublic archives of Massachusetts and show the model of a faithful state\r\ntreasurer. He might have been justified in retaining a lien upon these\r\nas a security against loss and damage to his very valuable real, and\r\npersonal estate, which he left, and which was soon confiscated, but his\r\nhigh sense of official duty forbade his recourse to any such precaution,\r\nand he withdrew from a country which he loved, not less than those who\r\nstayed at home, taking nothing which belonged to the public, but\r\nsurrendered all his property into the keeping of the public that treated\r\nhim so basely. He was also a creditor to many of the \"sons of\r\ndespotism,\" at the head of whom was John Hancock, who owed him a large\r\nsum for borrowed money, no part of which would he pay in his lifetime,\r\nand of which a small part was received from his executors.[219]\r\n\r\n  [219] This was the same as he did towards Harvard college, when\r\n  treasurer of same. History of Harvard College by Josiah Quincy.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives, August 8, 1775, \"Ordered, that Mr.\r\nHopkins be directed to inquire how the Committee of Supplies have\r\ndisposed of the horse and chaise formerly Harrison Gray's which was used\r\nby the late Dr. Warren, and came to the hands of the said Committee\r\nafter Dr. Warren's death.\" The next day, \"Ordered, that Dr. William\r\nEustis be, and hereby is directed, immediately to deliver to the\r\nCommittee of Supplies the horse and chaise which were in the possession\r\nof the late Doctor Warren, and which formerly belonged to Harrison\r\nGray.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Boston was evacuated, Mr. Gray, urged by a sense of duty, with the\r\nmale members of his family, tore himself away from his adored and only\r\ndaughter, Mrs. S. A. Otis, which so preyed upon her peace of mind that\r\nit finally caused her death.\r\n\r\nHe went to Halifax with his family of four persons where he stayed a\r\nshort time. \"He was passenger in one of the six vessels that arrived at\r\nLondon from Halifax, prior to June 10, 1776, laden with Loyalists and\r\ntheir families.\"\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Gray's house in London about the year 1789, Arthur Savage gave\r\nthe Rev. Mr. Montague a bullet taken from the body of General Warren the\r\nday after his death. Mr. Montague after his return to Boston, became\r\nrector of Christ Church. Harrison Gray, in a letter to him, dated\r\nLondon, August 1st, 1791, remarks to him in a spirit of loyalty to the\r\ncrown of Britain as follows: \"The melancholy state in which you\r\nrepresent religion to be in Boston and New England is confirmed by all\r\nwho come from thence. Is this one of the blessings of your independence\r\nto obtain which you sacrificed so many lives? I am glad your federal\r\nconstitution 'has had a very great and good effect', but very much\r\nquestion whether you will ever be so happy as you were under the mild\r\nand gentle government and protection of Great Britain; for,\r\nnotwithstanding the freedom my countrymen boast of, if in order to\r\nobtain it they have sacrificed their religion, they have made a poor\r\nbargain. They cannot, in a religious sense, be a free people till the\r\nSon of God has made them free. It is very surprising, considering the\r\nestablishment of the Roman Catholic religion at Quebec was one of the\r\nheavy grievances the American Congress complained of[220] that your\r\ngovernor and other great men in your town should attend the worship of\r\nGod in a Roman Catholic church, to hear a Romish bishop on a Sunday; and\r\nthat he should be one of the chaplains who officiated at a public\r\ndinner. I cannot at present account for their inconsistency any\r\notherwise than by supposing the part they took in the late unhappy\r\ncontests lays so heavy upon their consciences that they imagine no one\r\ncan absolve them but a Romish priest.\"\r\n\r\n  [220] See Chapter III. in relation to this matter.\r\n\r\nMr. Gray lived in England upon a pension granted by the British\r\ngovernment. In 1794 at the advanced age of eighty-four, this excellent\r\nand virtuous man sunk to rest. Perhaps no man among the many excellent\r\npersons who went into exile at this time was more beloved and regretted\r\nby his political enemies, for a more genuine model of nature's nobleman\r\nnever lived.\r\n\r\nJOHN GRAY, son of Harrison Gray and his wife Elizabeth, born in Boston,\r\n18th of May, 1755. He went to Ireland soon after the battle of\r\nLexington. Hearing that the difficulties would probably be adjusted, he\r\nembarked for Massachusetts, the vessel was taken off Newburyport. He was\r\nin Newbury Jail, February, 1776, when at the solicitation of his sister,\r\nthe mother of Harrison Gray Otis, an order was passed to allow his\r\nremoval to the Otis homestead in Barnstable on condition of his giving a\r\nbond with security in L1,000 not to pass without the limits of that\r\ntown, or deal or correspond with the enemy. Mr. Gray was in London,\r\nJanuary, 1781.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH GRAY was descended from an old Boston family, his grandfather\r\nJoseph Gray, was married by Rev. Samuel Williard to Rebecca Sears, June\r\n27, 1706. Their son Joseph Gray was born April 9, 1707, and married\r\nRebecca, daughter of John West of Bradford, or Haverhill of\r\nMassachusetts. The old people were displeased with the match and cut\r\nRebecca off with \"one pine tree shilling.\" Their son Joseph, the subject\r\nof this sketch, was born July 19, 1729. He was a loyalist and settled at\r\nHalifax, Nova Scotia, and was a member of the firm of Proctor & Gray,\r\nmerchants. His wife was Mary, daughter of Hon. Joseph Gerrish. His son,\r\nthe Rev. Benjamin Gerrish Gray, D. D., was born in 1768, married Mary,\r\ndaughter of Nathaniel Roy Thomas a Loyalist, and was many years rector\r\nof St. George's parish, Halifax, and afterwards of an Episcopal church\r\nin St. John, N. B. Died at the latter city in 1854. Another son of\r\nJoseph Gray was William, born in 1777. Was British Consul for Virginia\r\nfor a long time and died in England in 1845.\r\n\r\nJoseph Gray died at Windsor, N. S., in 1803 at the age of seventy-four,\r\nleaving a large number of descendants.\r\n\r\nJohn Gray of Boston, another brother of Joseph Gray. He was bred to\r\nbusiness in that town by Caleb Blanchard. About the year 1768 he went to\r\nEngland, but returned previous to hostilities, and was appointed Deputy\r\nCollector of Customs, in which office he was popular. In 1776 he\r\nembarked for Halifax with the Royal Army, and before the close of that\r\nyear was at Charleston, S. C., and in prison. He was still in that city\r\nas late as 1780, when he was an Addresser of Sir Henry Clinton. Before\r\nthe last mentioned date, however, he had engaged in business as a\r\ncommission merchant, and had purchased a plantation on account of\r\nhimself and of John Simpson, a fellow Loyalist of Boston. But involved\r\npolitically beyond the hope of extrication he sold his interest in the\r\nplantation, and invested the proceeds in indigo and in a ship with the\r\nintention of sailing for London. The Revolutionists not only defeated\r\nthis plan, but seized his vessel and his cargo, and the result was that\r\nof both he barely saved one hundred guineas. With this sum he fled to\r\nhis brother Joseph at Halifax, who provided him a passage to England in\r\na ship of war. Without any accession to his fortune yet, with letters to\r\nthe agents of the East India Company, he soon embarked for India, and,\r\non his arrival there, was well received. The family account is that he\r\nwrote a treatise on the Cultivation of Indigo, which the Governor and\r\nCouncil considered so valuable as to grant him L4,000 sterling, and\r\njointly with a Mr. Powell, an extensive tract of land. These two\r\ngrantees, assisted by the Company, established a factory, and began the\r\nculture of indigo, which was said to be the first attempt to cultivate\r\nthis beautiful dye in India. Both died suddenly in 1782 on the same day.\r\nGray was at the plantation, and Powell was two hundred miles away at the\r\nfactory, and the supposition was that they had incurred the jealousy of\r\nthe natives, who had caused their death by poison. Powell's brother told\r\nJoseph Gray, prior to 1799 that the estate of our Loyalist and his\r\nassociate had become \"the greatest indigo plantation in the known\r\nworld.\"[221]\r\n\r\n  [221] Sabine, Vol. I., Pp. 490-1.\r\n\r\nSamuel Gray was also a brother of Joseph Gray. He died at Boston in 1776\r\nleaving issue, male and female. His wife was a daughter of Captain Henry\r\nAtkins of Boston.\r\n\r\nThomas Gray of Boston was a merchant, a Protester against the\r\nRevolutionists, and one of the Addressers of Hutchinson.

His family were originally of Lancashire, England, and were of\r\ngentle blood. He died before the year 1698.\r\n\r\nREV. NEHEMIAH WALTER, son of the former, was born in Ireland, December,\r\n1663, and came to America with his father. He early distinguished\r\nhimself by proficiency in his studies at school, and by the age of\r\nthirteen was a master of the Latin tongue. It soon became evident that\r\nhis genius pointed to a professional life, and he was sent to Harvard\r\nUniversity where he graduated with honors in 1684. Shortly thereafter he\r\nremoved to Nova Scotia where he resided some months for the purpose of\r\nacquiring the French language. He became a distinguished scholar and\r\nbecame noted among the literati of the day. After a careful and\r\nimpartial examination and great deliberation, \"he fell in the way of the\r\nChurches of New England, as thinking their constitution practice in\r\ngeneral, with respect to worship, discipline and order, most comfortable\r\nto gospel institution and primitive practice.\" He was ordained a\r\ncolleague of the Rev. John Eliot October 17, 1688 at the age of\r\ntwenty-five. The first church at Roxbury had, at the earnest request of\r\nthe venerable Apostle Eliot, been seeking a colleague to share the\r\nduties which increasing infirmity rendered irksome to him; and Nehemiah\r\nWalter was chosen. Mr. Eliot died soon after this after a life crowned\r\nwith glory, honors, and labor, and it was a great consolation to him in\r\nhis latter days to see his people so happily settled under Mr. Walter.\r\nFor more than sixty years his successor faithfully discharged the duties\r\nof his office always to the acceptance of his people. He married Sarah,\r\nthe daughter of Rev. Increase Mather by Maria, daughter of the\r\ndistinguished Rev. John Cotton. Nehemiah Walter died September 17, 1750,\r\nand he was buried in the ministerial vault in the old burial ground,\r\ncorner of Washington and Eustis Streets, Roxbury.\r\n\r\nREV. THOMAS WALTER, second son of Nehemiah Walter, was born in Roxbury,\r\nDecember 13, 1696, and early gave evidence of most extraordinary genius.\r\nHe graduated from Harvard University in 1713 and was ordained October\r\n29th, 1718, and December 25th of the same year was married to Rebeckah,\r\ndaughter of Rev. Joseph Belcher. He was a man who combined great wit and\r\nhumor with infinite learning and excelled in the science of harmony. He\r\npublished works on music, and one of his sermons upon the 2nd Samuel\r\nXXIII 1 \"The Sweet psalmist of Israel\" which was delivered at the Boston\r\nLecture, has been pronounced \"the most beautiful composition among the\r\nsermons which have been handed down to us by our fathers.\" Others of his\r\nsermons were also published. Thomas Walter was one of the most\r\ndistinguished scholars and disputants of the day. \"He had all his\r\nfather's vivacity and richness of imagination with more vigor of\r\nintellect.\" For his genius and powers he was reckoned to be one of the\r\nablest clergymen that New England up to that time had produced. His\r\ndeath occurred on Sunday, January 10, 1724-5, and he expressed his hope\r\nthat he might die on that day, when lying prostrate with consumption.\r\nHis tomb is in the old burying ground, Roxbury. His daughter Rebeckah,\r\nwho was born in 1722, died unmarried January 11, 1780.\r\n\r\nRev. William Walter, the subject of this sketch, was a nephew of Thomas\r\nWalter. He was born in 1739, and graduated at Harvard College in 1756.\r\nUp to the time of the Revolution the preachers in the Episcopal church\r\noccupied the position of missionaries in the American colonies. They\r\nwere sent here and were in the pay of the \"Society for the Propagation\r\nof the Gospel in Foreign Parts.\" The following extracts are from letters\r\nwritten to the Secretary of the Society, and they explain themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Copy of a letter written to the Reverend Mr. Hooper of Trinity church\r\nin Boston, by Mr. Barnard, an eminent dissenting clergyman, in answer to\r\none from the former desiring the latter would be so good as to send him\r\na just and honest character of Mr. William Walter, who was talked of as\r\na fit person to be assistant Minister at said church.\"\r\n\r\n\"He came out of our College with the reputation of one of the best\r\nclassical scholars of his class. He lived first in this town in the\r\nbusiness of a Grammar Schoolmaster, which trust he executed for several\r\nyears to universal acceptance, faithful, and careful. I have reason to\r\nbelieve, in forming the tender minds of his pupils to virtue and\r\nreligion, as well as forwarding them in their scholastic exercise. When\r\nto the sorrow of the town, he quitted that employ, he became connected\r\nwith the Custom House. This business naturally raised complaints against\r\nhim among trading people. But all I have heard were of his not being so\r\nflexible in some matters as they wished, none of oppression, much less\r\nof mean fraudulent ways of filling his own pockets.\r\n\r\n\"His temper is innocently cheerful, open, and friendly. He has a tender\r\nand delicate sense of honor, a just idea of the truest honor. He is kind\r\nand compassionate, etc.\" This letter had the desired effect. It was\r\nwritten Oct. 15, 1763. He was ordained by the Bishop of London the\r\nfollowing year and became an assistant to the Rev. Mr. Hooper, whom he\r\nsucceeded as rector of Trinity church, the third Episcopal church in\r\nBoston, being opened in 1735. It stood on the corner of Summer and\r\nHawley Streets. It was a plain wooden structure without steeple or\r\ntower.\r\n\r\nIn 1767 he joined with the Clergy of Massachusetts and Rhode Island in\r\nsending a letter to England requesting that a Bishop be sent to\r\nAmerica. The letter says, \"We are too remote and inconsiderable to\r\napproach the Throne, yet could His Majesty hear the voice of so distant\r\na people the request for American Bishops would appear to be the crye of\r\nmany of his most faithful subjects.\"\r\n\r\n\"We do, however, think ourselves happy in this, that the Society will\r\nomit no favorable opportunity of representing the advantage that may\r\naccrue to these Colonies, to religion and to the British Interests, by\r\ncondescending to this one request.\"[222] The Episcopal form of worship\r\nwas always disagreeable to the Congregationalists, and when they\r\ndiscovered that the ministry entertained the design of sending over a\r\nbishop to the colonies, a controversy for years ran high on the subject.\r\nSo resolute was the opposition to this project that it was abandoned.\r\nThis controversy John Adams says contributed as much as any other cause\r\nto arouse attention to the claims of Parliament. The spirit of the times\r\nis well represented in a cartoon in the Political Register of 1769 which\r\nis here reproduced.\r\n\r\n  [222] Papers relating to the church in Massachusetts, Pp. 506-7, 531-2.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. William Walter was a firm Loyalist. At the evacuation of Boston\r\nhe was obliged to leave his house and accompanied by his family he went\r\nto Halifax. In 1776 he went to England, then returned and went to New\r\nYork, and acted for some time as Chaplain of a British regiment. While\r\nin New York he sent a letter to the Secretary of the S. P. G. F. P.,\r\ndated Dec. 8, 1781. It is interesting as it shows the trials and\r\ndifficulties of the ministers of the Church of England during the\r\nRevolution. It is in part as follows: \"I disbelieve that Mr. Bass ever\r\npreached a sermon for cloathing a rebel battalion, or ever read the\r\nDeclarative Act for independence in his church, or has altered his\r\nsentiments since his dismission, but that he opens his church on the\r\ndays appointed by Congress as Public days, is most certain, and if this\r\nis to be criminal, then every clergyman within the rebel lines is\r\ncriminal, and among others, Dr. Inglis, of this city, who did the same\r\nwhen Mr. Washington's army was here, yet no clergyman stands higher in\r\nthe esteem of the Society for his loyalty.\" The occasion of this letter\r\nwas the stopping of Mr. Bass's salary by the Society, as it had been\r\nreported to it that Mr. Bass had gone over to the rebels.\r\n\r\nAt the peace, accompanied by his family of six persons and by three\r\nservants, he went from New York to Shelburne, N. S., where the Crown\r\ngranted him one town and one water lot. His losses in consequence of his\r\nloyalty were estimated at L7,000. In 1791 he returned to Boston and the\r\nnext year was chosen Rector of Christ church.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANDING A BISHOP.]\r\n\r\nWilliam Walter was a zealous supporter of the church and crown, and\r\nvindicated his sincerity by the sacrifices he made for them. His\r\ndiscourses are described as rational and judicious, \"recommended by an\r\neloquence, graceful and majestical.\" He was no knight errant, but while\r\nadhering to his own convictions with quiet persistency, he exercised a\r\nlarge charity towards all forms of faith and Christian worship. The\r\ndegree of D. D. was conferred on him by Kings College, Aberdeen, in\r\n1784. In 1796 he was invited to deliver the Dudleian lecture at Harvard\r\nCollege and in 1798 he pronounced the anniversary discourse before the\r\nMassachusetts Humane Society, which was published. Dr. Walter was a\r\nremarkably handsome man; tall and well proportioned. When in the street,\r\nhe wore a long blue coat over his cassock and gown, wig dressed and\r\npowdered, a three-cornered hat, knee breeches of fine black cloth, and\r\nwith silk hose, and square quartered sleeves with silver buckles. His\r\ncountenance was always serene, his temper always cheerful; happy\r\nhimself, he communicated happiness to all around him. In the desk he\r\nread the glorious service like one inspired; his voice was clear,\r\nmusical and well modulated. In his family he was loved, reverenced and\r\nadmired. His heart, his house, his purse, were ever open to the needy.\r\nHe married Lydia, daughter of Benjamin Lynde, the younger, of Salem, and\r\nby her had seven children. Her death occurred in 1798.\r\n\r\nDr. Walter continued his rectorship at Christ church until his death in\r\n1800, at the age of sixty-one. The Rev. Dr. Parker, who preached his\r\nfuneral sermon, delineated his character as ornamental to religion and\r\nto the church, to literature and humanity. Dr. Walter's grandson, Lynde\r\nMinshall Walter, born in 1799, graduated at Harvard University in 1817.\r\nHe established the Boston Evening Transcript in 1830, and was the first\r\neditor of the paper. His death occurred in 1842. Another grandson,\r\nWilliam Bicker was born in Boston, April 19, 1796, and graduated at\r\nBowdoin College in 1818. He studied divinity at Cambridge but did not\r\npreach. He became best known as an author, possessing an active fancy\r\nand a great faculty of versification. He contributed odes and sonnets\r\nand translations to the newspapers and in 1821 in Boston, he published\r\n\"Poems\" and \"Sukey\" a poem. In 1822 he went to the southern states to\r\ngive lectures on poetry, but he died shortly after his arrival in\r\nCharleston, South Carolina, April 23, 1822.\r\n\r\nThis family so distinguished in ecclesiastical history of New England is\r\nbelieved now to be extinct. There were others of the name in Boston at\r\nan early period, who have perhaps left descendants, but they are not\r\nknown to have any connection with this family.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF CONFISCATED ESTATES BELONGING TO REV. WILLIAM WALTER IN SUFFOLK\r\n                        COUNTY AND TO WHOM SOLD.\r\n\r\n     To Leonard Jarvis, Sept. 27, 1784; Lib. 145, fol. 32; Land and\r\n       buildings in Boston, South St. W.; Samuel Quincy, an absentee, S.;\r\n       Robert Robbins and heirs of Benjamin Clark, deceased, E; Samuel\r\n       Connant N. and E.; Nathaniel Taylor, an absentee, N.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THOMAS AMORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nHugh Amory was living in the year 1605 at Wrington in Somersetshire,\r\nunder the northern side of Mendip Hills, this town and Shepton Mallett\r\nwas noted at this time for its broad cloth manufactures which, within\r\nfifty years had transformed England's industry and commerce in Somerset\r\nand Devon. Hugh and one of his sons was a merchant the other was a\r\nwoolen-draper, the latter, Thomas Amory, was the ancestor of the\r\nAmerican branch of the family, his career was the troubled one of a\r\nBristol merchant in the middle of the seventeenth century, when the city\r\nwas besieged and taken by both the Parliamentary and the King's army.\r\nHis son Jonathan was born in the county of Somerset in the year 1654,\r\nhis father owned the estate of St. Anne and other lands in the county\r\nwhich in the next century went to his descendants in this country, but\r\ntoo heavily encumbered to be of any value. Jonathan was brought up under\r\nthe care of his elder brother Thomas, who married Elizabeth Fitzmaurice\r\na daughter of the 19th Lord of Kerry, ancestor of the present Marquis of\r\nLandsdowne. In consequence of this connection he removed to Ireland,\r\ntaking his younger brother Jonathan with him, who in time became a\r\nmerchant at Dublin, where he is recorded in 1675 as the purchaser from\r\nthe city of the north bank of the Liffy. Dublin, hitherto, had lain\r\nwholly on the south side of the river. As late as 1816, L2, 10s. annual\r\nrent for it from \"Jonathan Armory\" still formed an item of the city's\r\nincome. It is now as other crowded city districts, which have wharves at\r\none end and a railway station at the other, with streets of\r\nage-blackened tenements and workshops between.\r\n\r\nJonathan Amory married Rebecca Houston in 1677, he went to the West\r\nIndies with his brother Robert in 1682, and his wife died at Barbados in\r\n1685. Jonathan Amory then went to South Carolina taking with him his\r\ninfant son Thomas. He married again, and invested largely in lands and\r\nhouses. He was elected speaker of the Colonial Legislature, and\r\nsubsequently treasurer of the Province. He died in the fall of 1699 of\r\nyellow fever.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS AMORY, son of the former, was born in Limerick, Ireland, in 1682\r\nand accompanied his father to South Carolina. In the year 1696 he was\r\nsent with his sister Anne to their relatives in England to be educated.\r\nHe was placed under the care of his cousin, Counsellor Amory, and was\r\nsent to the Westminster school. After his father's death he entered the\r\ncounting-house of Mr. Ozell, a French merchant in London who in the year\r\n1709 sent him to the Azores as supercargo. Here he established himself\r\nas a merchant and was appointed Dutch and English consul, and making\r\nonly an occasional visit to Europe. Here he remained many years. About\r\n1719 he embarked for Boston, and spent the following winter with his\r\nsister in Carolina. Returning to Boston he met Rebecca Holmes, daughter\r\nof Frances Holmes, and married her in May, 1721.\r\n\r\nThomas Amory bought lands at the South end of Boston, built a house and\r\nwharves, hired a counting-house of his friend, Governor Belcher, on the\r\nLong wharf and engaged in commerce with England, the Azores and\r\nCarolinas. He died in 1728, but his widow long survived him, dying in\r\nBoston in 1770 at the age of seventy. He left three sons and two\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS AMORY, son of the former, was born in Boston April 23, 1722, and\r\nentered the Latin school in 1735, and graduated at Harvard College in\r\n1741. He studied Divinity, but never took orders. As eldest son he\r\ninherited a double share of his father's estate. He married Elizabeth,\r\nthe daughter of William Coffin and by her had Rebecca, afterwards the\r\nwife of Dr. Aron Dexter. He purchased the house built by Governor\r\nBelcher at the corner of Harvard and Washington streets, the gardens of\r\nwhich extended to the water, and this was his principal residence for\r\nthe rest of his life. Thomas Amory was one of the Addressers of Gage but\r\nhe did not take an active part in controversies preceding the\r\nrevolution. He is described in a deed in 1769 as \"Thomas Amory\r\ngentleman\" in 1772 as \"Distiller\" and at other times as merchant. It was\r\nsaid that as the Revolution drew near he and his brother John planned to\r\nwithdraw to England, leaving in the care of their brother Jonathan, who\r\nwas childless, their combined families, to the number of twenty-three.\r\nHe was on terms of friendship with the British officers and when the\r\ntroops garrisoned the town, his house was attacked by the mob. He was\r\nentertaining some of the officers at his home, when bricks were thrown\r\nat his windows. One of these missiles waked his little daughter, by\r\nsmashing the pane and falling on her bed. He spoke to the mob from the\r\nporch and it dispersed, but he had first hastily sent his guests by the\r\ngarden way, to his boat, by which they were enabled to get to their\r\nquarters. His wife's family, the Coffins, were all Loyalists, and Thomas\r\nAmory therefore was regarded with some suspicion, especially as he was\r\nan \"Addresser\" of Gen. Gage.\r\n\r\nWhen General Washington entrenched Dorchester Heights, March 1776, in\r\norder to command Boston with his guns, the inhabitants saw danger from\r\nboth sides. Washington's assault would do great damage and the British\r\ntroops as they withdrew might fire the town. On March 8th Deacon\r\nNewhall, chairman of the selectmen, requested Thomas and Jonathan Amory,\r\nand their friend, Peter Johonnot, to carry to General Washington a paper\r\nprepared by four Selectmen, proposing that the British troops should be\r\nallowed to retire unmolested, on condition of doing no harm. The offer\r\nwas really authorized by General Robertson, acting for General Howe, but\r\nthis could not be put in writing, nor was the person named to whom the\r\npaper was addressed. The messengers, however, delivered it to General\r\nWashington, whereupon Colonel Learned on his behalf wrote them an answer\r\nto the effect that no notice could be taken of a letter neither\r\naddressed to himself, nor authenticated by General Howe. Nevertheless\r\nthe agreement was kept, as if it had been formally made. Ministers were\r\ntherefore able to deny to an angry opposition in Parliament that there\r\nhad been any compromise, or stipulation between General Howe and the\r\nrebels, although the Duke of Manchester affirmed that he had private\r\ninformation of it.[223]\r\n\r\n  [223] The descendants of Hugh Amory, London. 1901. The Amory Family,\r\n  Boston, 1856.\r\n\r\nOn the evacuation Thomas Amory withdrew to Watertown, where he lived\r\nsome years. He died shortly after the peace in 1784. His widow survived\r\nuntil 1823. He left nine children, seven of whom were married and\r\nresided in Boston. It is interesting to consider how the blood of the\r\nloyal and the disloyal afterwards became mixed. At the battle of Bunker\r\nHill June 17, 1776, Captain Linzee of the Kings ship-of-war Falcon\r\ncannonaded the works which Prescott the \"rebel\" defended, but the\r\ngranddaughter of Linzee was the wife of Prescott the historian who was a\r\ngrandson of the rebel, and this lady is a daughter of Thomas C. Amory,\r\nthe eldest son of this notice. Jonathan, the second son of our Loyalist,\r\nmarried Hettie, daughter of James Sullivan, governor of Massachusetts,\r\nwhile the wife of John Amory, another son, was near of kin to Henry\r\nGardner, the \"rebel\" who succeeded Harrison Gray, the last royal\r\ntreasurer of the same state. Again Nathaniel, another son, married a\r\nniece of Commodore Preble, and her sister was the wife of Admiral\r\nWormley of the Royal Navy. Once more, William, a fifth son, born in\r\n1774, was an officer in the British navy and after the war entered the\r\nU. S. navy and distinguished himself in the war with Tripoli, being one\r\nof the party that burnt the Philadelphia. He also distinguished himself\r\nin an attack under Hull on a fort in South America during the French\r\nwar. But \"loyalty\" as understood in olden time, is still represented in\r\nthe family by the union of Mr. Amory's grandson Charles with Martha\r\nGreene and of his grandson, James Sullivan, with Mary Greene, nieces of\r\nthe late Lord Lyndhurst. Mr. Amory's grandson, Thomas C., married Esther\r\nSargent, and William of the same degree of consanguinity married Anna,\r\ndaughter of David Sears of Boston. Of the sons here mentioned, Thomas C.\r\nAmory, was a successful merchant and died in 1812. Thomas C., Jr., also\r\na descendant, is the author of the Life of Governor Sullivan, his\r\ngrandfather on his mother's side.[224]\r\n\r\n  [224] Sabin's Loyalists of the American Revolution.\r\n\r\nJonathan Amory, brother to Thomas, was born in Boston December 19, 1726.\r\nHe married Abigail Taylor, and resided on what is now the opening of\r\nTemple Place into Washington street. His garden is said to have extended\r\ntwo or three hundred feet in either direction, joining his brother\r\nJohn's home which formerly had been Rufus Greene's in Newbury street, at\r\nthe corner of West street.\r\n\r\nJonathan Amory died in 1797, leaving a large estate to his brother John\r\nand John's children.\r\n\r\nJOHN AMORY, another brother of Thomas, was born in Boston in 1728. He\r\nmarried Catherine, daughter of Rufus Greene. He was the father of nine\r\nchildren who grew up and settled in his native town. He built a house\r\nat the corner of Beacon and Tremont streets, opposite King's chapel, and\r\nlived there, and in Washington street on the site where Amory hall\r\nafterwards stood. He engaged in commerce with his younger brother. The\r\nletters of this business house from 1760 during the Stamp Act excitement\r\nand the Tea troubles give many interesting particulars of that period.\r\nParts of this correspondence were published in English papers and to one\r\nletter a member of Parliament ascribed influence in the repeal of the\r\nStamp act. In 1757 the store of Jonathan and John Amory was \"the sign of\r\nthe Horse at the head of Dock Square,\" they afterwards (before 1762)\r\nremoved into King street \"just below the town house.\" Their store was\r\nprobably the last of the \"old stores\" in State street. The house,\r\ndistill-house stores and wharf were Thomas Amory's share of his father's\r\nproperty. Amory's wharf was at the east end of Castle street, on which\r\nin 1777 he had a still-house.\r\n\r\nIn 1774 John Amory left with his family for England. It was necessary\r\nthat one of the partners should go on business. At the beginning of\r\nhostilities his house owed their English creditors L23,000 sterling\r\nwhich they remitted without delay, while their countrymen who owed them,\r\nfrom inability, or taking advantage of the times paid, if at all, in a\r\ndepreciated currency.\r\n\r\nThe illness of his wife, which terminated in her death in 1778,\r\nprevented his return to Boston. Shortly before the peace he embarked for\r\nAmerica and landing at New York he took the oath of allegiance to the\r\nCrown. He was not permitted to live in Boston in consequence of the\r\n\"Banishment Act.\" His name had been placed upon the list of the\r\nproscribed, and preliminary measures were taken to confiscate his\r\nproperty. His brother wrote him should this be done he would always\r\nshare what he had with him. He resided in Providence till 1783, some of\r\nhis family being with him then through the influence of his friends in\r\nBoston, and upon his petition to the Legislature, declaring his\r\nallegiance to the new government, he was allowed to return to Boston. He\r\ndied in 1805, leaving six sons and four daughters. One of his daughters\r\nmarried John Lovell, widely known as a political writer, and another was\r\nthe wife of John McLean, who liberally endowed the Massachusetts General\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             REV. HENRY CANER.\r\n\r\n                         RECTOR OF KING'S CHAPEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Caner, D. D., was graduated at Yale College in 1724, and was the\r\n\"son of Mr. Caner who built the first college and rector's house\" at New\r\nHaven, Connecticut. For three years after leaving college he lived under\r\nthe theological teaching of Mr. Johnson of Stratford, who had the\r\ngeneral supervision of the Episcopal students of divinity, and who had\r\nbeen his college tutor. Though too young to be ordained, he assisted Mr.\r\nJohnson as a catechist and schoolmaster at Fairfield. In 1727 he went to\r\nEngland for ordination. For some years, subsequently, his ministry was\r\nconfined to Norwalk and Fairfield, Connecticut, and he became a great\r\nworker among the missions. His health became impaired by his severe\r\nlabors and in 1736 he sought relief by a voyage to England, where on the\r\nrecommendation of Archbishop Potter he had been created M. A. by a\r\ndiploma at Oxford March 8, 1735. His father died in 1731 at the age of\r\nsixty. The name was long preserved in New Haven by \"Caner's Pond.\" The\r\nname is also written sometimes Canner, or Conner.\r\n\r\nIn 1747 the successful missionary was inducted into office as rector of\r\nthe First Episcopal church (King's Chapel) Boston. On being invited to\r\nKing's Chapel he received a deserved promotion to the most conspicuous\r\nEpiscopal pulpit in America; after a laborious ministry of twenty-two\r\nyears in the mission at Fairfield, Connecticut. On his removal to Boston\r\nhe left behind him two hundred and three communicants, a large number of\r\nthose days, in a mission where he had found but twelve. Also a handsome\r\nchurch and a large convenient parsonage nearby.\r\n\r\nThe old chapel in Boston was built between 1687-1689. In 1710 it was\r\nrebuilt to twice its original size under Governor Shirley. After the\r\nlapse of nearly half a century King's Chapel was found to be in a\r\nruinous condition and measures were taken to rebuild, which resulted in\r\nthe well known King's Chapel now standing upon the spot. The erection of\r\nthis building in 1749 is largely due to the efforts of Dr. Caner, who\r\nwas then rector.\r\n\r\nThere is no trace of his printed discourses later than 1765, but the\r\ntraditions of his preaching give him a high rank as a man of learning\r\nand fine intellectual endowments. The first Episcopal church in New\r\nEngland was, prior to the revolution, in a flourishing state. Later,\r\nwhile the British ships were in the harbor and the British troops in the\r\ntown, many of their officers regularly worshipped at the chapel. When\r\nbecoming quite infirm in his seventy-seventh year, his age and position\r\nplaced Dr. Caner at the head of the Church of England clergy in this\r\npart of the country. Records show abundantly the pastoral labor which\r\ndevolved upon him, especially in his military congregation. The last\r\nburial records by his trembling hand are those of three soldiers of his\r\nMajesty's 65th Regiment of Foot. The Register of burials also notes the\r\nfuneral, on March 18, 1752, of Ann, \"the Pious and Virtuous Consort of\r\nRev. Henry Caner, aged forty-six.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a devoted Loyalist, and when it was evident he could no longer be\r\nuseful in Boston, he went with the British troops to Halifax. In one of\r\nthe record books of King's Chapel, Dr. Caner made the following entry:\r\n\"An unnatural rebellion of the colonies against his Majesty's government\r\nobliged the loyal part of his subjects to evacuate their dwellings and\r\nsubstance and take refuge in Halifax, London and elsewhere; by which\r\nmeans the public worship at King's Chapel became suspended, and it is\r\nlikely to remain so until it shall please God, in the course of his\r\nprovidence, to change the hearts of the rebels, or give success to his\r\nMajesty's arms for suppressing the rebellion. Two boxes of church plate\r\nand a silver christening basin were left in the hands of the Rev. Dr.\r\nBreynton at Halifax, to be delivered to me or my order, agreeable to his\r\nnote receipt in my hands.\" After being a rector in Boston for\r\ntwenty-eight years this aged clergyman was driven from his home and\r\nnative land. Dr. Caner's escape from Boston is thus described by himself\r\nin a letter dated Halifax, May 10, 1776: \"As to the clergy of Boston,\r\nindeed they have for eleven months past been exposed to difficulty and\r\ndistress in every shape; and as to myself, having determined to maintain\r\nmy post as long as possible, I continued to officiate to the small\r\nremains of my parishioners, though without support, till the 10th of\r\nMarch, when I suddenly and unexpectedly received notice that the King's\r\ntroops would immediately evacuate the town. It is not easy to paint the\r\ndistress and confusion of the inhabitants on the occasion. I had but six\r\nor seven hours allowed to prepare for this measure, being obliged to\r\nembark the same day for Halifax, where we arrived the first of April.\r\nThis sudden movement prevented me from saving my books, furniture, or\r\nany part of my interest, except bedding, wearing apparel, and a little\r\nprovision for my small family during the passage.\r\n\r\n\"I am now at Halifax with my daughter and servant, but with no means of\r\nsupport, except what I receive from the benevolence of the worthy Dr.\r\nBreynton.\"\r\n\r\nNo less than eighteen Episcopal clergymen from Boston and its\r\nneighborhood sailed away with the fleet that bore Dr. Caner, and the\r\ntown of Boston would have been left without any Episcopal clergymen at\r\nall, only for Dr. Andrew Eliot, the pastor of the New North church, who\r\ncalled upon Rev. Samuel Parker, assistant to Rev. William Walter of\r\nTrinity church. Mr. Parker was packing up his library preparing to\r\ndepart when called upon by Dr. Eliot, who with true Christian candor,\r\nrepresented to him the destitute situation in which the Episcopalians\r\nwould be left who should remain in the country, with all their ministers\r\ngone, that although it might be prudent for the elder gentlemen to go,\r\nwho had made known their sentiments, that he, a young man, who had done\r\nnothing to render himself obnoxious to the rebels, would be perfectly\r\nsafe, that it was a duty he owed to that part of the community to stand\r\nby them, finally he prevailed upon him to stay, a circumstance that\r\nBishop Parker always acknowledged with gratitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REV. HENRY CANER.\r\n\r\nBorn in New Haven, Conn, 1700. Rector of King's Chapel, Boston, 1747-76.\r\nDied in England Feb. 11, 1793.]\r\n\r\nFrom Halifax Dr. Caner went to England. An extract from the diary of\r\nThomas Hutchinson in 1776 says, \"I went with Dr. Caner to Lambeth, to\r\nintroduce him to the Archbishop who was very gracious to him, and gave\r\nhim an order for One Hundred Pounds on the Treasurer of the moneys\r\nreceived for the clergy of America.\" He was proscribed and banished,\r\nunder the statute of Massachusetts, in 1778, and his estate\r\nconfiscated. A fellow Loyalist wrote in 1785: \"By letters from London,\r\nI am informed that Dr. Caner had retired with his young wife to Cardiff,\r\nin Wales.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Caner died in England at the close of the year 1792 in his\r\nninety-third year. One of his daughters married a Mr. Gove of Boston.\r\nThe Boston Gazette (No. 2002) of February 11, 1793, contains the\r\nfollowing: \"At Long-Ashton, Somersetshire, England, aged ninety-three,\r\nthe Rev. Dr. Henry Caner, a very respectable character, many years\r\nminister of the Chapel church in this town.\" Foote in his \"Annals of\r\nKing's Chapel\" says, \"I am informed by Mr. Henry O. B. O'Donoghue of\r\nLong-Ashton, near Bristol, that there is no tombstone in the churchyard\r\nwith Dr. Caner's name, nor any trace to be found of such a person ever\r\nhaving lived in the Parish.\" It has been said, also, that Dr. Caner died\r\nin London in 1792.\r\n\r\nDr. Caner's house stood close to King's chapel on the north side of the\r\nold burying-ground, and was a rough wooden structure. This spot was\r\nafterwards occupied by the Boston Athenaeum, and later by a Savings\r\nBank. It next was occupied by the Massachusetts Historical Society, who\r\nsold it to the city of Boston, and it is now used as an annex to City\r\nHall.\r\n\r\nOn the evacuation of Boston the church vestments, plate, registers and\r\nrecords were taken from the church, a part of which last was recovered\r\nfrom Dr. Caner's heirs in 1805. King's Chapel and Christ church are now\r\nwithout doubt the only historical buildings remaining unchanged from\r\nbefore the revolution of all those in which Boston was once so rich.\r\n\r\nThe vestry of the chapel in 1784 applied to Rev. Dr. Caner to have\r\nrestored to them the \"Church Plate and Linnen which he carried away.\"\r\nThis he refused to do as his estate was taken from him by the public. He\r\nhowever turned it over to the \"Society for Propagation of the Gospel in\r\nForeign Parts,\" who afterwards disposed of it in the Provinces that\r\nremained loyal. In 1787 a silver flagon and covered cup which was\r\npresented to the chapel by Governor Hutchinson, having the name of King\r\nWilliam and Queen Mary engraved on it, was claimed by Dr. Thomas\r\nBulfinch, Warden, as the property of the King's Chapel, it then being in\r\nthe hands of Rev. Dr. Parker of Trinity church for safe-keeping. It is\r\nnow the property of the chapel.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF CONFISCATED ESTATES BELONGING TO REV. HENRY CANER IN SUFFOLK\r\n                         COUNTY AND TO WHOM SOLD.\r\n\r\n     To Samuel Henly, Sept. 30, 1793; Lib. 177, fol. 82; Land and\r\n       dwelling-house in Boston.

Some of the family came very early to Boston. The name is\r\nfirst mentioned in Boston Town Records 1690, when William Gayer married\r\nMaria Guard. In her will recorded with Suffolk Probate Records, Vol. 17,\r\np. 80, 1710, she described herself as the wife of William Gayer, Mariner\r\nof Nantucket. In 1692 Damaris Gayer, the daughter of William Gayer,\r\nmarried Nathaniel Coffin. Their son William Coffin removed to Boston and\r\nwas the ancestor of the Boston family of Coffins.\r\n\r\nThe Geyers were prominent merchants in Boston. They did not interest\r\nthemselves in political matters or held office. The records mention that\r\nin 1765 Mr. Henry Christian Geyer was paid L173. 4. 1. for repairs done\r\non Faneuil Hall.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the Revolution, Frederick William Geyer was one of\r\nthe principal merchants of Boston. He was proscribed and banished in\r\n1778, but not being an Addresser, or having taken any active part in\r\npolitics, he was allowed to come back in 1789 and was restored to\r\ncitizenship by Act of the Legislature. He was in business with his son\r\nat No. 13 Union street, Boston, in 1794. Died at Walpole, N. H., in\r\n1803. A daughter who died near London in 1855 at the age of 81, married\r\nMr. Joseph Maryatt, a West Indian merchant. She was the mother of\r\nCaptain Maryatt of the British Navy, the well known author of sea tales.\r\n\r\nMr. Geyer's estate was on Summer street, formerly Seven Star Lane, and\r\nwas one of the finest in Boston. In the inventory of his estate made by\r\nthe commissioner after his departure, the mansion house is valued at\r\nL6,000. It was confiscated and sold to Nathan Frazer, whose daughter\r\nafterwards married Frederick W. Geyer, Jr., and the property was once\r\nmore restored to the family.\r\n\r\nThe estate once belonged to Leonard Vassall, and contained one of the\r\nbest gardens in Boston. It was planted as early or before 1642 by\r\nGamaliel Wayte, for we find by the _Book of Possessions_ that this land\r\nis described as Wayte's Garden. Judge Sewall in his diary states that he\r\nlived to the age of 87, and not long before his death was blessed with\r\nseveral new teeth, which shows that he not only had the ability to\r\nplant, but to eat his fruits. Mrs. Maryatt, whose gardens at Wimbleton\r\nwere at one time the finest in England, and we may reasonably conjecture\r\nthat the taste and skill that produced such marvels, were nurtured and\r\nfostered in her younger days among the flower beds of Summer street.\r\nThis garden occupied the site of the store of C. F. Hovey & Co., and as\r\nlate as 1870 there was an old pear tree in the yard in a thrifty\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEONARD VASSALL AND FREDERICK W. GEYER MANSION, SUMMER\r\nSTREET.\r\n\r\nSite now occupied by C. F. Hovey & Co. The mother of Captain Marryatt\r\nwas born in this house.]\r\n\r\nNancy Geyer married Rufus Amory, February 13th, 1794. He was the second\r\nson of John Amory the Loyalist, and a very successful lawyer. The\r\nwedding is described as \"a very gay and brilliant affair.\" It gained an\r\nunexpected distinction in consequence of a heavy snowstorm by which\r\nPrince Edward, afterward Duke of Kent and father of Queen Victoria,\r\ntravelling from Canada to take command of the troops at Halifax, was\r\njust then detained at Boston. He accepted Mr. Geyer's invitation to the\r\nwedding, and came with his aides. \"His Royal Highness\" it is recorded,\r\nwas complaisant and affable in his deportment, and claimed the customary\r\nprivilege of kissing the bride, and bridesmaids. His host's son who was\r\nmarried the year before to Rebecca Frazer, the daughter of Nathan\r\nFrazer, who bought the Geyer mansion when it was confiscated, was an\r\nardent sympathizer with revolutionary France, who disapproved of titles.\r\nHe put their marriage notice in this form in the Boston Gazette of Jan.\r\n21, 1793. \"By Citizen Thatcher, Citizen Frederick W.

He\r\nwas the son of John Apthorp and Susan his wife, whose maiden name was\r\nWard, of the family of Lord Ward of Bexley.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of his father Charles Apthorp came to New England, and\r\nbecame one of the most distinguished merchants of Boston. He was\r\npaymaster and commissary under the British Government of the land and\r\nnaval forces quartered in Boston. On the 13th January, 1726, he married\r\nGrizzel, daughter of John Eastwicke. She was born August, 1708, at\r\nJamaica and came to Boston in 1716. Her mother was Griselda Lloyd,\r\ndaughter of Sir John Lloyd of Somersetshire, England, who assisted in\r\nconveying King Charles II to France after the battle of Worcester.\r\n\r\nCharles Apthorp was one of the first Wardens of Trinity church, and one\r\nof the committee that waited on Peter Faneuil, and in the name of the\r\ntown to render him their \"most hearty thanks for so beautiful a gift.\"\r\nTo King's Chapel he was a bountiful benefactor, having given L1,000\r\ntowards its rebuilding.\r\n\r\nCharles Apthorp had eighteen children, of whom fifteen survived him and\r\neleven married. He died in Boston suddenly in 1758 at the age of sixty.\r\nHis funeral took place at King's Chapel twelve days later and his\r\nremains were therein deposited. He was reputed as the \"greatest and most\r\nnoble merchant on the continent.\" He was also characterized as \"a truly\r\nvaluable member of society,\" and that \"he left few equals behind him.\" A\r\nmarble monument with a Latin inscription was placed in King's Chapel to\r\nhis memory by his sons, \"which monument covers the tomb of the\r\ntruly-noble-minded race of Apthorp.\"\r\n\r\nHe was very proficient in and a great admirer of the Fine Arts,\r\nespecially in painting and architecture; talents which have been\r\ntransmitted to his descendants as Charles Bulfinch, Esq., the architect\r\nof the State House and other edifices. The original mansion in Brighton,\r\nMassachusetts, formerly the Charles Apthorp place, still remains and is\r\nof great antiquity.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Charles Apthorp he possessed the whole of Long Island,\r\nthe largest island in Boston Harbor. Calf island also was formerly known\r\nas Apthorp's Island. The Apthorp heirs subsequently sold their interest\r\nin Long Island to their sister Grizzell's husband, Barlow Trecothick,\r\nLord Mayor of London. After the death of Trecothick the island passed on\r\nthe 11th June, 1790, into the possession of his brother-in-law Charles\r\nWard Apthorp of New York.\r\n\r\nCHARLES WARD APTHORP, the eldest son of Charles Apthorp, married in New\r\nYork Mary McEvers. He had three sons and three daughters. Of his\r\ndaughters, Charlotte Augusta was the only one who left descendants. Her\r\nhusband was John Cornelius Vanden Heuvel, a Dutch gentleman of fortune,\r\nwho had been Governor of Demerara and afterwards settled in New York.\r\nMaria Eliza, their eldest daughter, married John C. Hamilton, a son of\r\nthe celebrated Alexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\nCharles Ward Apthorp was a member of the Council of New York in 1763 and\r\nserved until 1783. He had lands in Maine and a large amount of property\r\nin Boston, Brookline, and Roxbury, all of which was confiscated. He died\r\nat his seat, Bloomingdale, in 1797.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"BISHOP'S PALACE,\" RESIDENCE OF REV. EAST APTHORP.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams says, \"It was thought to be a splendid palace and intended\r\nfor the residence of the first royal bishop.\"]\r\n\r\nJOHN APTHORP, the second son, went to England, and became connected in\r\nbusiness with the house of Tomlinson & Trecothick. He married Alicia\r\nMann of Windsor, sister of Sir Horace Mann, many years resident British\r\nminister at Florence. Mr. Apthorp embarked for Italy with his wife who\r\nwas in a very hazardous state of health, and who died at Gibraltar,\r\nleaving two daughters under the care of their grandmother at Windsor. He\r\npursued his travels in Italy, and afterwards returned to Boston, where\r\nhe married Hannah Greenleaf, daughter of Stephen Greenleaf, the last\r\nRoyal high sheriff of Suffolk County. He lived about four years at\r\nBrighton, when he embarked, with his wife, from New York for Charleston,\r\nS. C, to enjoy a warmer winter climate, and they were lost at sea. The\r\nchildren, one son and two daughters, were left under the care of their\r\ngrandfather who attended most faithfully to their interests and\r\neducation. One daughter married Charles Bulfinch his cousin, and the\r\nother Charles Vaughn, son of Samuel Vaughn, Esq., of London. The son,\r\nCol. John T. Apthorp, married Grace Foster, who lived only one year,\r\nleaving an infant. In another year he married her twin sister Mary by\r\nwhom he had a numerous family.\r\n\r\nREV. EAST APTHORP, D. D., was born in Boston in 1733 and was educated at\r\nCambridge, England. He took orders and returned, and became the founder\r\nand rector of Christ church in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Here he\r\npublished a pamphlet in defence of the conduct of the society for\r\n\"Propagating the gospel\" which was attacked by Dr. Mayhew, who was\r\nanswered by the Archbishop of Canterbury. This controversy rendered his\r\nsituation irksome and after only six years ministry in this country, he\r\nleft for England. It was thought by many that the establishment of the\r\nEpiscopal church at Cambridge was for the purpose of converting the\r\nstudents who were generally dissenters and with ulterior views, which\r\nexcited the most acrimonious jealousy.\r\n\r\nWhile General Burgoyne's army was detained at Cambridge, Lieutenant\r\nBrown, who was out on parole according to the terms of the Convention,\r\nwas riding with two ladies in a chaise when he was killed in cold blood\r\nby a sentinel, a boy scarcely fourteen years old, who levelled his gun\r\nat him and shot him through the head. \"His remains were interred in\r\nChrist's church. The people, during the time the service was being\r\nperformed, seized the opportunity of the church being open, which had\r\nbeen shut since the commencement of hostilities, to plunder, ransack,\r\nand deface everything they could lay their hands on, destroying the\r\npulpit, reading desk, and communion table, and ascending the organ loft\r\nthey destroyed the bellows and broke all the pipes of a very handsome\r\ninstrument.\"[226] Rev. East Apthorp was afterwards successively vicar of\r\nCroydon where Governor Hutchinson resided, and rector of Bow church,\r\nLondon, which he exchanged for the prebendary of Finsbury; he had many\r\nfriends among the dignitaries of the church and was greatly beloved and\r\nrespected. By his wife, the daughter of Foster Hutchinson, and niece of\r\nThomas Hutchinson, he had several children. His only son became a\r\nclergyman, and his daughters married Dr. Cary and Dr. Butler, heads of\r\ncolleges, and a third daughter married a son of Dr. Paley.\r\n\r\n  [226] Travels through the interior parts of America by Thomas Aubury.\r\n  Vol. II, pp. 232, 234.\r\n\r\nHe published two volumes of Discoveries on the Prophecies, delivered at\r\nWarburton lecture, Lincoln's Inn, and a volume in answer to Gibbon. The\r\nlast twenty-six years of his life were passed at Cambridge, England,\r\nwith almost total loss of sight, and he died in April, 1816, at the age\r\nof eighty-three, closing a life of great usefulness.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS APTHORP, born 19 October, 1741, continued paymaster of the\r\nBritish forces after his father's death from 1758 to 1776, when he was\r\nproscribed, and banished. He went to England and lived several years at\r\nLudlow, Wales. He visited Lisbon for health, where he married. He\r\nreturned to Ludlow, where he died, leaving a widow and one son.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM APTHORP, born Feb. 26, 1748, married Mary Thompson. He was a\r\nmerchant, and was proscribed and banished in 1778. The year after, he\r\ncame from New York to Boston. He was arrested, and occupied for awhile a\r\nprivate room in the deputy jailer's house, but letters were received to\r\nhis disadvantage, and he was committed to a close prison by order of the\r\nCouncil, his countrymen would show him no mercy.\r\n\r\nSUSAN APTHORP the second daughter of Charles Apthorp, married Thomas the\r\nson of Dr. Bulfinch. She had several children, three only that arrived\r\nat a marriageable age. Charles Bulfinch, the only son was born in\r\nAugust, 1763, and graduated at Harvard College in 1781, and after living\r\nabroad for some time returned to Boston in 1786. He inherited talents\r\nfrom his grandfather and became a great architect. He was chairman of\r\nthe board of Selectmen for twenty-one years during which official\r\nservice many of the great improvements in the town were executed,\r\nincluding the State House, City Hall, the General Hospital and the\r\nbuilding of Franklin Street. After the capitol of the United States was\r\nburnt, in 1814, Mr. Bulfinch was appointed by President Munroe to\r\nsuperintend its re-erection. His wife died in 1841, and his death\r\nfollowed three years later on April 15, 1844.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LIST OF CONFISCATED ESTATES BELONGING TO CHARLES WARD APTHORP, IN\r\n                 SUFFOLK COUNTY AND TO WHOM SOLD.\r\n\r\n     To Joseph Hall, April 27, 1782; Lib. 134, fol. 187; Land and moiety\r\n       of dwelling-house in Boston, Cole Lane S.W.; Joseph Hall E.; Samuel\r\n       Barrett N.; Jonathan Williams W.\r\n\r\n     To Edward Smith, June 10, 1782; Lib. 135, fol. 12; Land and\r\n       buildings in Boston.

The original home is supposed to be what is now\r\nGowthwaite manor, three miles from Pateley Bridge, Yorkshire, West\r\nRiding.\r\n\r\nHe probably came with Governor Winthrop's fleet to America. His first\r\nappearance in the Boston records appeared June 14, 1631. Thomas\r\nGoldthwaite settled in Roxbury where his name appears as \"Thomas\r\nGouldthwaight\" in Rev. John Eliot's list of his church members, Eliot\r\nhaving begun his pastorate there in 1632. Thomas was made a freeman in\r\nMassachusetts, May 14, 1634. In 1636 he appears in Salem where, as an\r\ninhabitant he was granted ten acres of land. His first house lot has\r\nbeen located by some of the best antiquarian authority, as on the\r\nsouthwest corner of Essex and Flint Streets in Salem. In 1636 he married\r\nhis first wife. Her death occurred some time before 1671 and he then\r\nmarried Rachel Leach, of Salem. He was called \"Constable Gouldthwaight\"\r\nat a meeting of the selectmen, December 14, 1659. Thomas died in March,\r\n1683, at about the age of seventy-three, his wife Rachel surviving him.\r\nHe left three children, Samuel, Mehitable, and Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL GOLDTHWAITE, (of the second generation) like his father, was a\r\ncooper, and lived in Salem. For many years during his lifetime and that\r\nof his immediate descendants, four family homesteads lay side by side on\r\nthe original Goldthwaite farm, opposite the site where the Peabody\r\nchurch afterwards was built. He died about the year 1718, leaving ten\r\nchildren and perhaps more.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN JOHN GOLDTHWAITE (of the third generation), son of the former,\r\nwas born in Salem in 1677. By trade he was a mason and early settled in\r\nBoston where he married, March 13, 1701, Sarah Hopkins. They were\r\nmarried by the Rev. Cotton Mather of whose church John Goldthwaite was a\r\nmember. After the death of Cotton Mather he was one of three who took\r\ninventory July 22, 1728. His home was in Boston until 1725, and the\r\nbirthplace of all his children was on the north side of Charter Street,\r\nnear Copp's Hill burying-ground, on the property given to his wife and\r\nher sisters by their uncle, Major Thomas Henchman. He sold this place\r\nMay 17, 1725, and removed to another estate he had purchased on the\r\nsoutheast side of Mill pond. Here he passed the remainder of his life.\r\nHis son Ezekiel inherited the estate after his father's death, and sold\r\nit to Thomas Sherburn, his brother-in-law.\r\n\r\nSarah Goldthwaite died Oct. 31, 1715, at the age of thirty-five and is\r\nburied in Copp's Hill. John Goldthwaite married Mrs. Jane Halsey of\r\nBoston as his second wife. From 1708 to 1758 his name is often mentioned\r\nin Boston records. He is one of seventeen named as the founders of the\r\nNew North church in 1714. His name appears in records of the Ancient and\r\nHonorable Artillery Company, and in the town records with the title of\r\ncaptain, in 1741. In his old age he had a barbecue for descendants on\r\nNorth Square. It was held under a tent because they were too numerous to\r\nassemble in a house. He died June 25, 1766, and is probably buried in\r\nthe tomb of his son Ezekiel on Copp's Hill. He had nine children by his\r\nfirst wife and five by his second.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN JOSEPH GOLDTHWAITE (fourth generation) fourth child of John, was\r\nborn November 11, 1706, in Boston. He married February 8, 1727, Martha\r\nLewis, who was born in Boston and baptized in the second church, Feb.\r\n29, 1707, the daughter of Martha (Burrell) and Philip Lewis. Joseph\r\njoined the Artillery Company in 1730 and in 1738 was First Sergeant. In\r\n1745 he joined the Colonial army for the siege of Louisburg and\r\naccording to records in the British war office, being commissioned\r\nadjutant in the first Massachusetts regiment, Honorable William\r\nPepperell, colonel, March 12, 1744-(5) and captain (brevet) March 20,\r\n1744-(5). After his return from the war he became a private citizen, and\r\nis seldom spoken of in records by his military title, being rather\r\ncalled esquire, or gentleman. In 1728 he appears as a goldsmith, and\r\nlater as a merchant, licensed as a retailer at his store on Marlboro\r\nStreet (part of Washington) in 1737 and again in 1742. He held several\r\nappointments and later became constable. His home in 1744 was on Fish,\r\nafterwards North Street. In 1773 he and his family retired to a farm\r\npurchased by him in western Massachusetts, July 10, 1773, ten acres and\r\nmansion house. Here Joseph Goldthwaite died March 1, 1780, aged\r\nseventy-two. His widow died October 26, 1783, aged seventy-five, and a\r\ndouble stone marks their graves in Weston. He had ten children.\r\n\r\nEZEKIEL GOLDTHWAITE (fourth generation) son of John, born at Boston,\r\nJuly 9, 1710. Married Nov. 2, 1732, Elizabeth Lewis of Boston. For the\r\ngreater part of his life he was Registrar of Deeds for the County of\r\nSuffolk. His first signature as registrar was Nov. 6, 1740. He was an\r\nAddresser of Hutchinson in 1774, and a protester against the\r\nRevolutionist the same year, although like many other loyalists he was\r\none of the 58 Boston memorialists in 1760 who arrayed themselves against\r\nthe Crown officials, and having sowed the seeds of sedition, afterwards\r\nbecame alarmed at its results, mob rule.\r\n\r\nHis last signature as registrar is said to have been written Jan. 17,\r\n1776, two months before the evacuation of Boston. He died seven years\r\nlater, Dec. 4th, 1782, in his 73rd year. His widow died Feb. 6, 1794,\r\naged 80.\r\n\r\nCOLONEL THOMAS GOLDTHWAITE (fourth generation) son of John, born in\r\nBoston Jan. 15, 1717, married August 26, 1742, Esther Sargent. He became\r\nan influential citizen of Chelsea, acting as selectman, moderator of\r\ntown meetings, and from May, 1757, till his removal from the town, seven\r\nyears in succession, was its deputy to the House of Representatives,\r\nwhere he was active in introducing important legislation.\r\n\r\nHe was given many important positions under the Colonial government. In\r\n1763 he was appointed to the command of Fort Pownal, removing his\r\nfamily there from Chelsea. This was an important frontier post,\r\ncommanding the entrance to the Penobscot River, and offered the\r\nadvantage, also of a rich trade with Indians, then numerous in those\r\nparts. Not long after succeeding to this command in company with Francis\r\nBernard, son of the Governor he purchased a large tract of land, 2,700\r\nacres in the neighborhood of the fort, on condition of their settling\r\nthereon thirty families, of building an Episcopal church, and employing\r\na minister. The enterprise was interrupted by the Revolution, in which\r\neach side endeavored to get control of all the arms and ammunition\r\npossible, and to take into its possession, or render defenceless, such\r\nposts as could be held by the enemy. With such an object in view, in\r\nApril, 1775, Capt. Mowatt, who afterwards burned Falmouth, now Portland,\r\nanchored before Fort Pownal, and a letter containing Governor Gage's\r\norders having been delivered to Col. Goldthwaite he carried away the\r\ncannon belonging to the fort. The attitude taken by its commander in\r\nallowing the fort to be thus disarmed, was never forgiven by the\r\nRevolutionists, and he ever after was regarded as a Loyalist. His\r\nexplanation of his conduct on that occasion is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"On the 27th of last month about 20 armed men arrived here from St.\r\nGeorge's who came in the name, and as a committee from the people of St.\r\nGeorge's, and others, who they say had assembled there to the amount of\r\n250; and this party in their name demanded of me the reason of my\r\ndelivering the cannon belonging to this fort to the King's forces. I\r\nwent into the fort and got the Governor's letter to me, and it was read\r\nto them. I then informed them that this was the King's fort, and built\r\nat his expense, that the Governor was commander in-chief of it; that I\r\ncould not refuse to obey his orders.\"\r\n\r\nLittle is known of Col. Goldthwaite between the surrender of Fort Pownal\r\nin the spring of 1775 and his arrival in England early in 1780. Gov.\r\nHutchinson mentions in his diary that, \"T. Goldthwaite arrived at\r\nPortsmouth Feb. 15, 1780.\" In an entry of the previous Dec. 4, the\r\nGovernor mentions a call from \"young Goldthwaite, son of J. Goldthwaite\r\nnow at New York.\" It must have been quite soon after his arrival that\r\nColonel Goldthwaite settled at Walthamstow, Essex, a few miles north of\r\nLondon. Samuel Curwen in his journal speaks of dining with him there\r\nJuly 29, 1782. His son Thomas married Mrs. Primatt, a lady of fortune,\r\nin the summer of 1780, and also lived in the town. The houses of both\r\nfather and son are still there and easily identified, and are in\r\nexcellent preservation. The Colonel's residence is of brick or stone\r\ncovered with stucco, the main portion three stories high, and an\r\nentrance with Ionic pillars. The grounds are ample and handsomely laid\r\nout with well kept walks and planted with trees and shrubbery.\r\n\r\nAfter a life of nearly twenty years spent in retirement in England, Col.\r\nGoldthwaite died Aug. 31, 1799, in his 82 year. Mrs. Catharine, his\r\nwife, died Dec. 16, 1796, aged 81. They lie buried in Walthamstow church\r\nyard.\r\n\r\nMAJOR JOSEPH GOLDTHWAITE, (fifth generation), the eldest of Joseph's\r\nchildren, was born in Boston, October 5, 1730. He entered the Boston\r\nLatin school in 1738, and probably commenced his military career, which\r\nhe afterwards followed near the commencement of the French and Indian\r\nwar, when about twenty-five years old. He married October 5, 1730,\r\nHannah Bridgham, said to have been of Barre, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nIn 1759 he appears as Major in the regiment from Boston under the\r\ncommand of Col. John Phillips, January 1, 1760 to January 10, 1761, on\r\nthe roll of field and staff officers in Colonel Bagley's regiment in\r\nservice at Louisburg, in which he acted also as paymaster. He served\r\nduring the campaign of 1762 as Lieut. Colonel of the regiment commanded\r\nby Colonel Richard Saltonstall, roll dated Boston, Feb. 19, 1763, in\r\nwhich he is called \"of Roxbury.\" He was addressed at that time as\r\ncolonel.\r\n\r\nOctober 5, 1768, Joseph Goldthwaite was appointed as Commissary to the\r\nBritish troops who had been quartered in Boston on account of the\r\nresistance the inhabitants had shown to the custom officials. In\r\nMassachusetts Historical Society's collections, Vol. X, p. 121, is\r\nprinted a list of the different nations of Indians that met Sir William\r\nJohnson at Niagara, July, 1764, to make peace in behalf of their tribes\r\nwhich was \"inclosed in a letter from Colonel Joseph Goldthwaite of\r\nBoston, to Dr. Stiles, A. D. 1766.\"[227]\r\n\r\n  [227] Dr. Ezra Stiles, afterwards President of Yale College, and at this\r\n  time a settled minister at Newport.\r\n\r\nAmong the Goldthwaites who remained loyal to the crown, Major Joseph was\r\none of the strongest. He was an Addresser of Hutchinson in 1775, and\r\nduring the siege he passed the winter in Boston. At the evacuation he\r\naccompanied the British army to Halifax, and thence to Quebec. Nine days\r\nbefore his departure from Boston he wrote a letter to his uncle Ezekiel\r\nGoldthwaite, Esq., of Boston, acquainting him with his property and the\r\nhousehold goods he had left behind. \"In short, I leave behind me at\r\nleast three thousand pounds sterling. You give the enclosed to my wife,\r\nif you can meet her. When I shall see her God only knows. Don't let her\r\nwant for anything.\"[228]\r\n\r\n  [228] Goldthwaite Genealogy compiled and published by Charlotte\r\n  Goldthwaite.\r\n\r\nSome experiences of Major Joseph's wife, Mrs. Hannah, while her husband\r\nwas shut up in Boston with the British army, appear in the Journal of\r\nthe Massachusetts House of Representatives.[229]\r\n\r\n  [229] See Forces American Archives. Vol. III, pp. 312, 314, 355.\r\n\r\nAugust 4, 1775, Mrs. Goldthwaite with her sister-in-law and a Mrs.\r\nChamberlain, left Boston with a horse and chaise and crossed the\r\nWinnisimmet Ferry. She was arrested and taken under guard to the general\r\ncourt at Watertown. It appeared on her examination that her health was\r\nimpaired, and an order was passed to allow her to visit Stafford for the\r\nbenefit of the waters there, but under the care of the Selectmen, and\r\nafterwards to retire to the house of her brother Joseph Bridgham at\r\nRehoboth, and to be under the committee of correspondence. It was\r\nColonel Loammi Baldwin who had them arrested and taken to Watertown and\r\naccording to his account, it was an act on their part which must have\r\nrequired considerable courage \"no such instance having happened before,\"\r\nthe city being then closely besieged.\r\n\r\nMrs. Goldthwaite petitioned the court to allow her to use the waters in\r\nNewton instead of at Stafford, her health being very delicate, and the\r\npetition was accompanied by her physician's certificate. This was\r\ngranted to her and she probably remained through the siege at Newton\r\nwhere the family of Mr. Benjamin Goldthwaite had also taken refuge.\r\nAfter the siege she returned to Boston where she died, probably never\r\nseeing her husband again.\r\n\r\nMajor Goldthwaite from Quebec, went to New York, and his death occurred\r\nthere October 3, 1779. He had been proscribed and banished in 1778. It\r\nwas at this time he drew up his will, which is at Somerset House,\r\nLondon, dated Feb. 11, 1778. As he died childless, he bequeathed his\r\nproperty to his brother's and sister's children \"provided that none of\r\nthem are Rebels, and have borne arms against their King, otherwise to go\r\nto the next eldest son of the same family who is loyal, and true to his\r\nKing, and country.\" Of the several Goldthwaite Loyalists, Major Joseph\r\nwas one of the most uncompromising in his devotion to his King and\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN PHILIP GOLDTHWAITE, (fifth generation), brother to Major Joseph\r\nGoldthwaite, was born in Boston, March 27th, 1733. He was a member of\r\nthe Boston Latin School in 1741. He married June 7, 1756, Mary Jordan of\r\nBiddeford. His title of captain seems to have come from his command of\r\nvessels, and it is interesting to note that in every generation of his\r\ndescendants to the present day there have been more or less who have\r\nchosen the same occupation.\r\n\r\nCaptain Philip was an officer of the Customs at Winter Harbor, and\r\nremained loyal when the war broke out. Sabin says he was one of the two\r\npersons of Saco and Biddeford dealt with by the Revolutionists of that\r\nsection for their loyal principles and that as soon as the war commenced\r\nhe placed himself under British protection at Boston. An earlier record\r\nin regard to him says: \"Captain Philip Goldthwaite was brought before\r\nthe New Hampshire Committee of Safety at Portsmouth, Nov. 23, 1775, on\r\nsuspicion of being unfriendly to the liberties of America. Upon\r\nexamination nothing appearing against him, ordered that he be\r\ndismissed.\"\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt however, as to Captain Philip's real sentiments.\r\nThe atmosphere in which he was living must soon have become unendurable\r\nto one holding his opinions, and therefore we soon find him in England,\r\nwhere he appears as early as 1780, at that date taking out his brother's\r\nadministration papers. He bought an annuity in the king's household and\r\nbecame one of the Gentlemen of the bed chamber. In October, 1786, it\r\nappears from the probate records at Boston, that he had died probably at\r\nsea, for Edward Daws of Boston, trader, is administrator of the estate\r\nof Philip Goldthwait, late of Boston, mariner. His inventory contained\r\nclothes, a quadrant, books and chest, and amounted to L7, 10 s. He left\r\nseveral sons and daughters, whose descendants are now quite numerous.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL GOLDTHWAITE, (fifth generation), brother of the aforesaid Philip,\r\nwas born in Boston, March 20th, 1735, and married Amy Borden of Newport,\r\nR. I., where he became a prominent merchant. He very early came under\r\nsuspicion as having loyalist sentiments. After the death of his brother,\r\nMajor Joseph, in New York, October, 1779, he petitioned the Rhode Island\r\nGeneral Assembly representing that his brother had lately died in New\r\nYork, leaving a large estate there in the hands of persons who were\r\nwasting it, also that he had been authorized to settle it if he could\r\nobtain permission to go to New York, asking to be allowed to do so, and\r\nto return with the effects when obtained, which petition the Council,\r\nafter consideration, granted.\r\n\r\nHe did not, however, return, and in July 1780, an act was passed by the\r\nRhode Island Assembly, proscribing persons that had left the state and\r\njoined the enemy, ordered if they returned they should be apprehended,\r\nand imprisoned or transported. \"Samuel Goldthwaite, merchant, late of\r\nNewport,\" was included in the list. Orders were also given under the\r\nsame date that such property as he left in Newport should be inventoried\r\nand taken into possession of the Sheriff. About this time Samuel had\r\ngone to England on business connected with the settlement of his\r\nfather's and brother's estates, for in the same year he was\r\nadministrator on them in London. One year later he had returned to his\r\nwife Amy, at that time preferring a petition to the Rhode Island\r\nAssembly, stating that her husband was then in New York, and had\r\nrequested her, with her family, to come to him, and praying the Assembly\r\nto permit her with her family, furniture, and effects, to go to him\r\nthere by the first opportunity. The petition was granted and she went in\r\na cartel vessel under the direction of William Taggart. The family\r\nsettled in Baltimore after the Revolution, and have left many\r\ndescendants there.\r\n\r\nDR. MICHAEL B. GOLDTHWAITE, (fifth generation), son of Joseph, of\r\nBoston, born there Jan. 5th, 1740, married Sarah Formon, March 8th,\r\n1759. He was an eminent surgeon and attended the army at the taking of\r\nLouisburg. Like most physicians of that day, he kept an apothecary shop,\r\nwhich was in 1774 on Hanover Street. He was an Addresser of both\r\nHutchinson and Gage. He died in 1776. He was an ardent sympathizer with\r\nthe loyalists.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT HENRY GOLDTHWAITE, (fifth generation) son of Colonel Thomas,\r\nof Walthamstow, England, born at Chelsea, March 29, 1759, married in\r\nEngland, Sarah Winch of Brampton, Oxon. Henry's name is found as one of\r\nthe garrison of Fort Pownal Oct. 23, 1775. He afterwards entered the\r\nBritish Army remaining in America, in that service, for some years after\r\nmost of his family had taken up their abode in England. The records of\r\nthe British War Office show that he was ensign, Independent Co.\r\nInvalids, Nov. 13, 1793. Lieutenant Royal Garrison Battalion, Sept. 9,\r\n1795, and lieutenant half pay Oct. 31, 1796. He died at sea, in the\r\nMediterranean early in 1800. He left two sons, Charles, born 1796, and\r\nHenry Barnes, born 1797, whose descendants are living in England.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF CONFISCATED ESTATES BELONGING TO JOSEPH GOLDTHWAIT IN SUFFOLK\r\n                      COUNTY AND TO WHOM SOLD.\r\n\r\n     To Perez Morton, Sept. 24, 1782: Lib. 136, fol. 9: One undivided\r\n       half of land, distill house and other buildings in Boston.

His son Isaac Howe, was baptized in Roxbury\r\nin 1655. Isaac had a son Isaac, born in Dorchester, July 7, 1675. He had\r\na son Joseph, born in Dorchester, March 27, 1716, who was the father of\r\nJohn Howe, born in Boston, October 14, 1754. Joseph Howe was a reputable\r\ntradesman in Marshall's Lane. He apprenticed his son to learn the\r\nprinting business.\r\n\r\nRichard Draper, the publisher of the _Massachusetts Gazette_, and\r\n_Boston News Letter_ died June 5, 1774. He left no children. His wife\r\nconducted the business for several months, and then formed a business\r\nconnection with John Howe.\r\n\r\nHowe had recently become of age, and was a sober, discreet young man.\r\nMrs. Draper, therefore, was induced, a short time before the\r\ncommencement of the war, to take him into partnership, but his name did\r\nnot appear in the imprint of the Massachusetts Gazette till Boston was\r\nbesieged by the Continental Army.\r\n\r\nHowe remained with his partner until they were obliged to leave Boston\r\nin consequence of the evacuation of the town by the British troops,\r\nMarch 17, 1776, when they went to Halifax, from there he went to\r\nNewport, R. I., when the British took possession of the town December\r\n8th.\r\n\r\nJohn Howe was married at Newport by Rev. George Bisset, Rector of\r\nTrinity Church, to Miss Martha Minns. Mr. William Minns accompanied his\r\ndaughter from Boston, and was present at the ceremony. William Minns was\r\nborn at Great Yarmouth, England, December 16, 1728. In 1737 he\r\naccompanied his uncle, Robert Ball, and his widowed mother, and came to\r\nBoston. Miss Martha Minns was sixteen years of age when she married John\r\nHowe. She was noted for her beauty and her portrait is still in\r\npossession of her family. The issue of this marriage was three sons and\r\nthree daughters.\r\n\r\nMr. Howe commenced the publication of a newspaper for the British at\r\nNewport; it was called The Newport Gazette, and the first paper was\r\nissued January 16, 1777.\r\n\r\nThe last number of a bound volume of this paper in possession of the\r\nRedwood Library at Newport, is dated January 15, 1778, but the\r\npublication of the paper probably continued till the evacuation of\r\nNewport by the British, October 25, 1779.\r\n\r\nThe paper was published in a house on the opposite side of the Parade,\r\nthe Vaughn estate, now a market. A recent writer says:\r\n\r\n\"During the time the British were in possession of Newport, it was the\r\noffice of the Newport 'Gazette,' the paper printed by the British on the\r\npress and type of the Newport 'Mercury.' Before that the 'Mercury' was\r\nprinted by Solomon Southwick, in Queen Street, but when the island fell\r\ninto the hands of the enemy, Southwick, as is well-known, buried his\r\ntype in the rear of what was the old Kilburn House on Broad Street (now\r\nBroadway) and left the town. The loyalists recovered the type, and a\r\nprinter named Howe began the printing of the 'Gazette.'\"\r\n\r\nA bound file of the newspaper published by Mr. Howe is in the possession\r\nof the Redwood Library. It runs, with a few numbers missing, from No. 1,\r\nto No. 52, January 15, 1778.\r\n\r\nThe first number was issued Jan. 16, 1777, with the following\r\nintroduction.\r\n\r\n     \"The Favours which the Subscriber has received from the Gentlemen\r\n     of the _Army and Navy_, in Boston and elsewhere, joined with the\r\n     Importunities of many of the Inhabitants of this Town, has induced\r\n     him, as speedily as possible, to gratify them with a _Newspaper_.\r\n     He can only say, that his best endeavors shall not be wanting to\r\n     render it as entertaining as possible: And he has nothing to wish\r\n     for, but the Exercise of that Candour he hath so often before been\r\n     indebted to. Its _size_ is at present contracted, owing to the\r\n     Impossibility of procuring larger printing Paper; but if more\r\n     Intelligence should at any Time arrive, than this can contain, the\r\n     Deficiency will be supplied with a _Supplement_. No Subscriptions\r\n     are received; but if any Gentlemen choose to have the Paper weekly\r\n     the Boy shall leave it at their houses. Articles of intelligence\r\n     will be thankfully received and every favor gratefully\r\n     acknowledged, by their\r\n\r\n                               Obedient humble servant,\r\n                                                 JOHN HOWE.\"\r\n\r\nThe British evacuated Newport, October 25, 1779, and Mr. and Mrs. Howe\r\naccompanied them to New York, and thence removed to Halifax and took up\r\ntheir permanent abode there, on the corner of Sackville and Barrington\r\nStreets. Here on Friday, January 5th, 1781, he published the first issue\r\nof the Halifax Journal, a paper that continued to be published regularly\r\nuntil 1870. It is said that Mr. Howe brought with him the printing press\r\nthat had once belonged to Benjamin Franklin, and the first that the\r\nphilosopher had ever possessed. It did the printing for the Howe family\r\nfor years. Mr. Howe was for many years King's printer for the Province,\r\nwhich secured to him all the government printing, including the\r\npublishing of the official gazette. For some years previous to his\r\ndeath, he held the office of postmaster-general and justice of the\r\npeace, and was living at the time of his death, December 29, 1835, at\r\nhis beautiful residence on the Northwestarm, in good circumstances, and\r\nhad the respect of the whole community.\r\n\r\nMr. Howe was a Sandemanian, that is, a follower of Robert Sandeman, who\r\ncame to Boston from Glasgow in 1764; they held their first meetings at\r\nthe Green Dragon Tavern, and afterwards had a meeting-house in the rear\r\nof Middle or Hanover street. This society rejected the belief in the\r\nnecessity of spiritual conversion, representing faith as an operation of\r\nthe intellect, and speculative belief as quite sufficient to insure\r\nfinal justification. This sect continued till 1823, when the last light\r\nwas extinguished in Boston. Many of the Sandemanians were Loyalists, and\r\nwent to Halifax. They may have built on a sandy foundation, but judging\r\nfrom their fruits, we may charitably conclude that in the main they were\r\ncorrect. Probably they did not like a church and state religion; and\r\nthat may have been all. The few who were in Halifax met every Lord's day\r\nin an upper room, in the building lately used by Baxter as a furniture\r\nwarehouse on Prince Street. The members, male and female, sat together\r\naround a table and took the Lord's Supper. This was weekly. There was\r\nsinging and prayers, and Mr. Howe would afterward stand up, read a\r\nchapter of the Bible, and give an address. No doubt it was very good and\r\nsimple and delivered with a calm, quiet sort of eloquence. When the\r\nmeeting was over the brothers and sisters in fellowship, (only the more\r\nelderly members) rose and kissed one another, and seemed to be\r\nremarkably happy. It is said that in the afternoon of every Sunday the\r\nold gentlemen members went down to the room below and dined together,\r\nand probably edified one another with religious conversation. Those now\r\nliving who have ever been with these Sandemanians in that upper room\r\nwill never forget the calm godly faces of such men as old Mr. Howe, Mr.\r\nGreenwood and Mr. Mansfield. Strange to say, none of the Howes, and very\r\nfew, if any, of the other families have followed in the track of these\r\ngood men and women as to creed. It is to be hoped that many have been\r\ninfluenced for good by what they may have recalled of such worthy\r\nancestors. Old Mr. Greenwood fell dead in the room while reading, and\r\nMr. Mansfield died the same day from some accidental cause.\r\n\r\nIn a speech delivered by his son JOSEPH HOWE, in Boston July 4, 1858, he\r\nspoke of his father as follows: \"The loyalists who left these States\r\nwere not, it must be confessed, as good republicans as you are, but they\r\nloved liberty under their old forms, and their descendants love it too.\r\nMy father, though a true Briton to the day of his death, loved New\r\nEngland, and old Boston especially, with filial regard. He never lost an\r\nopportunity of serving a Boston man, if in his power. At the close of\r\nyour railway banquet, one gentleman told me that my father had, during\r\nthe last war, taken his father from the military prison at Melville\r\nIsland, and sent him back to Boston. Another, on the same evening,\r\nshowed me a gold watch, sent by an uncle, who died in the West Indies,\r\nto his family. It was pawned by a sailor in Halifax, but redeemed by my\r\nfather, and sent to the dead man's relatives. And so it was all his\r\nlife. He loved his sovereign, but he loved Boston too, and whenever he\r\ngot sick in his latter days, we used to send him up here to recruit. A\r\nsight of the old scenes and a walk on Boston Common were sure to do him\r\ngood, and he generally came back uncommonly well.\" Elsewhere the same\r\nson remarked: \"For thirty years he was my instructor, my playfellow,\r\nalmost my daily companion. To him I owe my fondness for reading, my\r\nfamiliarity with the Bible, my knowledge of old colonial and American\r\nincidents and characteristics. He left me nothing but his example, and\r\nthe memory of his many virtues, for all that he ever earned was given to\r\nthe poor. He was too good for this world. But the remembrance of his\r\nhigh principle, his cheerfulness, his childlike simplicity, and truly\r\nChristian character, is never absent from my mind.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Martha Howe died Nov. 25, 1790, aged 30 years, and was buried in\r\nSt. Paul's churchyard, Halifax.\r\n\r\nA few years after the death of his first wife, Mr. Howe married Mrs.\r\nAustin, a widow with several children, wife of Captain Austin. By her he\r\nhad two children, Sarah and Joseph. Mrs. Howe died in 1837. He had eight\r\nchildren, and at the present time there are eighty-five of his\r\ndescendants, out of all these the survivors who bear the name of Howe\r\nonly number sixteen. Many of his descendants were men of great\r\nprominence. His son William Howe, Assistant Commissary-General, who died\r\nat Halifax, January, 1843, aged fifty-seven. John Howe, Queen's Printer,\r\nand Deputy Postmaster-General, who died at the same place the same year,\r\nand David Howe, who published a paper at St. Andrew, N. B., Joseph, born\r\nDecember 13, 1804, became Hon. Joseph Howe, Governor of Nova Scotia in\r\nMay, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SAMUEL QUINCY.\r\n\r\n                             SOLICITOR-GENERAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdmund Quincy, the first of the name in New England, landed at Boston on\r\nthe 4th of September, 1633. He came from Achurch in Northamptonshire,\r\nwhere he owned some landed estate. That he was a man of substance may be\r\ninferred from his bringing six servants with him, and that he was a man\r\nof weight among the founders of the new commonwealth appears from his\r\nelection as a representative of the town of Boston in the first General\r\nCourt ever held in Massachusetts Bay. He was also the first named on the\r\ncommittee appointed by the town to assess and raise the sum necessary to\r\nextinguish the title of Mr. Blackstone to the peninsula on which the\r\ncity stands. He bought of Chickatabut, Sachem of the Massachusetts tribe\r\nof Indians, a tract of land at Mount Wollaston, confirmed to him by the\r\nTown of Boston, 1636, a portion of which is yet in the family.\r\n\r\nEdmund Quincy died the year after making this purchase, in 1637, at the\r\nage of 33. He left a son Edmund and a daughter Judith. The son lived, in\r\nthe main, a private life on the estate in Braintree. He was a magistrate\r\nand a representative of his town in the General Court, and\r\nLieutenant-Colonel of the Suffolk Regiment.\r\n\r\nPoint Judith was named after his daughter. She married John Hull, who,\r\nwhen Massachusetts Bay assumed the prerogative of coining money, was her\r\nmint-master, and made a large fortune in the office, before Charles II.\r\nput a stop to that infringement of the charter. There is a tradition\r\nthat, when he married his daughter to Samuel Sewall, afterwards Chief\r\nJustice, he gave her for her dowry, her weight in pine-tree shillings.\r\nFrom this marriage has sprung the eminent family of the Sewalls, which\r\nhas given three Chief Justices to Massachusetts and one to Canada, and\r\nhas been distinguished in every generation by the talents and virtues of\r\nits members.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Quincy, who was a child when brought to New England,\r\ndied in 1698, aged seventy years, having had two sons, Daniel and\r\nEdmund.\r\n\r\nDaniel died during his father's lifetime, leaving an only son John, who\r\ngraduated at Cambridge in 1708, and was a prominent public man in the\r\nColony for nearly half a century. He was a Councillor, and for many\r\nyears Speaker of the Lower House.\r\n\r\nHe died in 1767, at the time of the birth of his great-grandson, John\r\nQuincy Adams, who therefore received the name which he has made\r\nillustrious. Edmund, the second son, graduated in 1690, and was also in\r\nthe public service almost all his life, as a magistrate, a Councillor,\r\nand one of the Justices of the Supreme Court. He was also colonel of the\r\nSuffolk Regiment, at that time a very important command, since the\r\ncounty of Suffolk then, and long after, included what is now County of\r\nNorfolk, as well as the town of Boston. In 1737, the General Court\r\nselected him as their agent to lay the claims of the Colony before the\r\nhome government, in the matter of the disputed boundary between\r\nMassachusetts Bay and New Hampshire.\r\n\r\nHe died, however, very soon after his arrival in London, February 23,\r\n1737, of the smallpox, which he had taken by inoculation. He was buried\r\nin Bunhill Fields, where a monument was erected to him by the General\r\nCourt, which also made a grant of land of a thousand acres in the town\r\nof Lennox to his family, in further recognition of his public services.\r\n\r\nJudge Edmund Quincy had two sons, Edmund and Josiah.\r\n\r\nThe first named, who graduated at Cambridge in 1722, lived a private\r\nlife at Braintree and in Boston.\r\n\r\nOne of his daughters married John Hancock, the first signer of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, and afterwards Governor of Massachusetts.\r\nJosiah was born in 1709, and took his first degree in 1728. He\r\naccompanied his father to London in 1737, and afterwards visited England\r\nand the Continent more than once.\r\n\r\nFor some years he was engaged in commerce and ship-building in Boston,\r\nand when about forty years of age he retired from business and removed\r\nto Braintree, where he lived for thirty years the life of a country\r\ngentleman, occupying himself with the duties of a county magistrate, and\r\namusing himself with field sports. Game of all sorts abounded in those\r\ndays in the woods and along the shore, and marvellous stories have come\r\ndown, by tradition, of his feats with gun and rod. He was Colonel of the\r\nSuffolk Regiment, as his father had been before him; he was also\r\nCommissioner to Pennsylvania during the old French war to ask the help\r\nof that Colony in an attack which Massachusetts Bay had planned upon\r\nCrown Point. He succeeded in his mission by the help of Doctor Franklin.\r\n\r\nColonel Josiah Quincy, by his first marriage, had three sons, Edmund,\r\nSamuel, Josiah, and one daughter, Hannah. His first wife was Hannah\r\nSturgis, daughter of John Sturgis, one of his Majesty's Council, of\r\nYarmouth. His eldest son, Edmund, graduated in 1752, after which he\r\nbecame a merchant in Boston. He was in England in 1760 for the purpose\r\nof establishing mercantile correspondences. He died at sea in 1768, on\r\nhis return from a voyage for his health to the West Indies.\r\n\r\nThe youngest son of Colonel Josiah Quincy bore his name, and was\r\ntherefore known to his contemporaries, and takes his place in history,\r\nas Josiah Quincy, Junior, he having died before his father, he was born\r\nFebruary 23, 1744, and graduated at Harvard College, 1763. He studied\r\nlaw with Oxenbridge Thacher, one of the principal lawyers of that day,\r\nand succeeded to his practice at his death, which took place about the\r\ntime he himself was called to the bar. He took a high rank at once in\r\nhis profession, although his attention to its demands was continually\r\ninterrupted by the stormy agitation in men's minds and passions, which\r\npreceded and announced the Revolution, and which he actively promoted by\r\nhis writings and public speeches. On the 5th of March, the day of the so\r\ncalled \"Boston Massacre\" he was selected, together with John Adams, by\r\nCaptain Preston, who was accused of having given the word of command to\r\nthe soldiers that fired on the mob, to conduct his defence and that of\r\nhis men, they having been committed for trial for murder. At that moment\r\nof fierce excitement, it demanded personal and moral courage to perform\r\nthis duty. His own father wrote him a letter of stern and strong\r\nremonstrance against his undertaking the defence of \"those criminals\r\ncharged with the murder of their fellow citizens,\" exclaiming, with\r\npassionate emphasis, \"Good God! Is it possible? I will not believe it!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Quincy in his reply, reminded his father of the obligations his\r\nprofessional oath laid him under, to give legal counsel and assistance\r\nto those accused of a crime, but not proved to be guilty of it; adding:\r\n\"I dare affirm that you and this whole people will one day rejoice that\r\nI became an advocate for the aforesaid criminals, _charged_ with the\r\nmurder of our fellow citizens. _To inquire my duty and to do it, is my\r\naim._\" He did his duty and his prophecy soon came to pass.\r\n\r\nThere is no more honorable passage in the history of New England than\r\nthe one which records the trial and acquittal of Captain Preston and his\r\nmen, in the midst of the passionate excitements of that time, by a jury\r\nof the town maddened to a rage but a few months before by the blood of\r\nher citizens shed in her streets.\r\n\r\nIn 1774 he went to England, partly for his health, which had suffered\r\nmuch from his intense professional and political activities, and also as\r\na confidential agent of the Revolutionary party to consult and advise\r\nwith the friends of America there. His presence in London coming as he\r\ndid at a most critical moment excited the notice of the ministerial\r\nparty, as well as of the opposition. The Earl of Hillsborough denounced\r\nhim, together with Dr. Franklin, in the House of Lords, \"as men walking\r\nthe streets of London who ought to be in Newgate or Tyburn.\" The precise\r\nresults of his communications with the English Whigs can never be known.\r\nThey were important enough, however, to make his English friends urgent\r\nfor his immediate return to America, because he could give information\r\nwhich could not safely be committed to writing. His health had failed\r\nseriously during the latter months of his residence in England, and his\r\nphysicians strongly advised against his taking a winter voyage.\r\n\r\nHis sense of public duty, however, overbore all personal considerations,\r\nand he set sail on the 16th of March, 1775, and died off Gloucester,\r\nMassachusetts, on the 26th of April.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Gloucester buried him with all honor in their graveyard;\r\nafter the siege of Boston, he was removed and placed in a vault in the\r\nburying ground in Braintree. Josiah Quincy was barely thirty-one years\r\nof age when he thus died.\r\n\r\nHis father, Colonel Quincy lived on at Braintree during the whole of the\r\nwar. He died on March 3rd, 1784.\r\n\r\nHis passion for field sports remained in full force till the end, for\r\nhis death was occasioned by exposure to the winter's cold, sitting upon\r\na cake of ice, watching for wild ducks, when he was in his seventy-fifth\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL QUINCY, the subject of this memoir, was the second son of Colonel\r\nJosiah Quincy, and the brother of Josiah, Junior, and Edmund. He was\r\nborn in that part of Braintree now Quincy, April 23, 1735. He graduated\r\nat Harvard College in 1754, and studied law with Benjamin Pratt.\r\n\r\nEndowed with fine talents, Mr. Quincy became eminent in the profession\r\nof the law, and succeeded Jonathan Sewall as Solicitor-General of\r\nMassachusetts. He was the intimate friend of many of the most\r\ndistinguished men of that period, among whom was John Adams. They were\r\nadmitted to the bar on the same day, Nov. 6, 1758.\r\n\r\nAs Solicitor for the Crown, he was engaged with Robert Treat Paine in\r\nthe memorable trial of Capt. Preston, and the soldiers in 1770; his\r\nbrother was opposed to him on that occasion, and both reversed their\r\nparty sympathies in their professional position. It was plain to all\r\nsagacious observers of the signs of the times, that the storm of civil\r\nwar was gathering fast; and it was sure first to burst over Boston. It\r\nwas a time of stern agitation, and profound anxieties. In their emotion\r\nMr. Quincy and his wife shared deeply, and passionately. The shadows of\r\npublic and private calamity were already beginning to steal over that\r\nonce happy home. The evils of the present and the uncertainties of the\r\nfuture bore heavily on their prosperity. The fierce passions which were\r\nsoon to break out into revolutionary violence and mob rule, had already\r\nbegun to separate families, to divide friends, and to break up society.\r\nSamuel Quincy was a Loyalist and remained true to his oath of office,\r\nwherein he swore to support the government. His father and brother were\r\nrevolutionists; as previously stated his brother died on shipboard off\r\nGloucester, seven days after the hostilities had commenced at Lexington,\r\nand when his father saw from his house on Quincy Bay, the fleet drop\r\ndown the harbor, after the evacuation of Boston on March 17, 1776, it\r\nmust have been with feelings of sorrow that the stout-hearted old man\r\nsaw the vessels bear away his only surviving son, never to return again.\r\nSuch partings were common griefs then, as ever in civil wars, the\r\nbitterest perhaps that wait upon that cruelest of calamities.\r\n\r\nSamuel Quincy was an addressor of Governor Hutchinson, and a staunch\r\nLoyalist. His wife, the sister of Henry Hill, Esq., of Boston, was not\r\npleased with her husband's course in the politics of the times, and he\r\nbecame a Loyalist against her advice, and when he left Boston, a\r\nrefugee, she preferred to remain with her brother, and never met her\r\nhusband again. The following letter written to his brother by Mr.\r\nQuincy, during the siege of Boston, will explain his position at that\r\ntime.[230]\r\n\r\n  [230] This letter and the following ones are extracts from original\r\n  papers, copies of which were communicated by Miss Eliza S. Quincy, and\r\n  published In Curwen's Journal and Letters.\r\n\r\n     To Henry Hill, Esq., Cambridge.             Boston, May 13, 1775.\r\n\r\n     Dear Brother:\r\n\r\n     There never was a time when sincerity and affectionate unity of\r\n     heart could be more necessary than at present. But in the midst of\r\n     the confusions that darken our native land, we may still, by a\r\n     rectitude of conduct, entertain a rational hope that the Almighty\r\n     Governor of the universe will in his own time remember mercy.\r\n\r\n     I am going, my dear friend, to quit the habitation where I have\r\n     been so long encircled with the dearest connections.\r\n\r\n     I am going to hazard the unstable element, and for a while to\r\n     change the scene--whether it will be prosperous or adverse, is not\r\n     for me to determine. I pray God to sustain my integrity and\r\n     preserve me from temptation.\r\n\r\n     My political character with you may be suspicious; but be assured,\r\n     if I cannot _serve_ my country, which I shall endeavor to the\r\n     utmost of my power, I will never _betray it_.\r\n\r\n     The kind care of my family you have so generously offered\r\n     penetrates me with the deepest gratitude. If it should not be\r\n     within my power to reward you, you will have the recompense greater\r\n     than I can give you, the approbation of your own heart. Would to\r\n     God we may again enjoy the harmonious intercourse I have been\r\n     favored with since my union with your family. I will not despair of\r\n     this great blessing in some future and not very distant period. God\r\n     preserve you in health and every earthly enjoyment, until you again\r\n     receive the salutation of\r\n\r\n                                    Your friend and brother,\r\n                                                      SAMUEL QUINCY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAMUEL QUINCY.\r\n\r\nBorn at Braintree, now Quincy, April 23, 1735. Solicitor-General of\r\nMassachusetts. Died at sea in 1789. His remains were interred on Bristol\r\nHill, England. From a painting by Copley.]\r\n\r\nAgain on August 18th he writes to Mr. Hill and said, \"You conjure me by\r\nthe love of my country to use my best endeavors to bring about a\r\nreconciliation, suggesting that the Americans are still as determined as\r\never to die free, rather than live slaves; I have no reason to doubt the\r\nzeal of my fellow-countrymen in the cause of freedom, and their firmness\r\nin its defence, and were it in my power, my faithful endeavors should\r\nnot be wanting (nay, I have a right to say they are not) to effect an\r\naccommodation. But, my good friend, I am unhappy to find that the\r\nopinion I formed in America, and which in a great measure governed my\r\nconduct, was but too justly founded. Every proposal of those who are\r\nfriendly to the colonies, to alter the measures of government and\r\nredress the grievances of which they complain, is spurned at, unless\r\nattended with previous concessions on their part. This there is less\r\nreason every day to expect, and thus the prospect of an accommodation is\r\nthrown at a distance; nor is there yet the least reason to suppose that\r\na formidable, if any opposition will be framed against administration in\r\nfavor of America.\r\n\r\n\"These are facts, not of conjecture only, but visible and operative. Your\r\nreflection will perhaps be, we must then work out our own salvation by\r\nthe strength of our own arm, trusting in the Lord. Really, my friend, if\r\nthe colonies, according to their late declaration, have made a\r\nresistance by force their choice, the contest is in short reduced to\r\nthat narrow compass. I view the dangerous and doubtful struggle with\r\nfear and trembling; I lament it with the most cordial affection for my\r\nnative country, and feel sensibly for my friends. But I am aware it is\r\nmy duty patiently to submit the event as it may be governed by the\r\nall-wise counsels of that Being 'who ruleth in the heavens, and is the\r\nGod of armies.'\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to his wife, London, Jan. 1, 1777, he said: The continuance\r\nof our unhappy separation has something in it so unexpected, so\r\nunprecedented, so complicated with evil, and misfortune, it has become\r\nalmost too burdensome for my spirits, nor have I words that can reach\r\nits description. I long much to see my father. It is now more than\r\neighteen months since I parted with him in a manner I regret. Neither of\r\nyou say anything of the family at Braintree. They ought not to think me\r\nregardless of them though I am silent; for, however lightly they may\r\nlook upon me, I yet remember them with pleasure.\r\n\r\nAgain, on March 12, 1777, he said: You inquire whether I cannot bear\r\ncontempt and reproach, rather than remain any longer separated from my\r\nfamily? As I always wished, and I think always endeavored, not to\r\ndeserve the one, so will I ever be careful to avoid the other. You urge\r\nas an inducement to my return, that my countrymen will not deprive me of\r\nlife. I have never once harbored such an idea. Sure I am I have never\r\nmerited from them such a punishment. Difference of opinion I have never\r\nknown to be a capital offence, and were the truth and motives of my\r\nconduct justly scrutinized, I am persuaded they would not regard me as\r\nan enemy plotting their ruin. That I might yet be able to recover in\r\nsome respect the esteem of my friends, I will not doubt while I am\r\nconscious of the purity of my intentions. When I determined on a voyage\r\nto England, I resolved upon deliberation, and I still think, with\r\njudgment. I did not, indeed, expect so hurried a succession of events,\r\nthough you must remember, I long had them in contemplation.\r\n\r\nI am sorry you say nothing of my father, or the family at Braintree; I\r\nhave not received a line nor heard from them since I left America. * *\r\nGod bless you all; live happy, and think I am as much so as my long\r\nabsence from you will permit.\r\n\r\n                                                  March 20, 1777.\r\n\r\n     I am not surprised much that, to the less of property, I have\r\n     already sustained, I am to suffer further depredations, and that\r\n     those to whom I am under contract should avail themselves of this\r\n     opportunity and endeavor to make what is left their own. All I ask\r\n     is that my brother and my other friends (if I have any) would think\r\n     of me as they ought, and to be assured, that as far as they\r\n     interpose their assistance to save me from suffering, they will not\r\n     hereafter find me deficient in return.\r\n\r\n                                                    October 15, 1777.\r\n\r\n     If things should not wear a more promising aspect at the opening of\r\n     the next year, by all means summon resolution to cross the ocean.\r\n     But if there is an appearance of accommodating this truly unnatural\r\n     contest, it would be advisable for you to bear farther promise; as\r\n     I mean to return to my native country whenever I may be permitted,\r\n     and there is a chance for my procuring a livelihood. But I do not\r\n     say that I will not accept of an opening here, if any one should\r\n     offer that I may think eligible.\r\n\r\n                                                   London, April 18, 1778.\r\n\r\n     If there is an accommodation, I shall certainly turn my views to\r\n     some part of the continent, unless something very promising should\r\n     offer elsewhere. It would grieve me very much to think of never\r\n     again seeing my father; God bless him, and many other worthy\r\n     friends and relations in New England; but a return to my native\r\n     country I cannot be reconciled to until I am convinced that I am as\r\n     well thought of as I know I deserve to be. I shall ever rejoice in\r\n     its prosperity, but am too proud to live despised where I was once\r\n     respected--an object of insult instead of the child of favor.\r\n\r\n     You suggest, that had I remained, I might still have been with you\r\n     in honor and employment. It may be so, but when I left America I\r\n     had no expectation of being absent more than a few months, little\r\n     thinking operations of such magnitude would have followed in so\r\n     quick a succession; I left it from principle, and with a view of\r\n     emolument. If I have been mistaken, it is my misfortune, not my\r\n     fault. My first letters from my friends congratulated me on being\r\n     out of the way; and I was pleased to find my undertaking met with\r\n     their approbation as well as my own. The hearts of men were not\r\n     within my reach, nor the fortuitous event of things within my\r\n     control. \"I am indeed a poor man;\" but even a poor man has\r\n     resources of comfort that cannot be torn from him, nor are any so\r\n     miserable as to be always under the influence of inauspicious\r\n     stars. I will therefore still endeavor to bear my calamities with\r\n     firmness, and to feel for others.\r\n\r\n     Those who have befriended my family are entitled to my warmest\r\n     gratitude, and I hope you will never fail to express it for me.\r\n     Whether it ever will be in my power to recompense them I know not,\r\n     but no endeavor of mine shall be wanting to effect it. * * * I\r\n     conjecture, though you do not mention from what quarter, you have\r\n     received unkindness. There are in this world many things we are\r\n     obliged and enabled to encounter, which at a distance appear\r\n     insupportable. You must have experienced this as well as I; and it\r\n     ought to teach us that best doctrine of philosophy and\r\n     religion--resignation. Bear up, therefore, with fortitude, and wait\r\n     patiently in expectation of a calmer and brighter day.\r\n\r\n                                                 London, May 31, 1778.\r\n\r\n     By the public prints we are made acquainted with an act of the\r\n     state of Massachusetts Bay, that precludes those among others from\r\n     returning, who left it since the 19th of April, 1775, and \"joined\r\n     the enemy.\" You do not mention this act, nor have I any information\r\n     by which I am to construe what is meant by \"joining the enemy.\" The\r\n     love of one's country, and solicitude for its welfare, are natural\r\n     and laudable affections; to lose its good opinion is at once\r\n     unhappy, and attended with many ill consequences; how much more\r\n     unfortunate to be forever excluded from it without offence! It is\r\n     said also that there is a resolve of congress, \"that no absentee\r\n     shall be permitted to take up his residence in any other colony\r\n     without having been first received and admitted as a citizen of his\r\n     own.\" This may have some effect on a movement I had in\r\n     contemplation of going southward, where I have a very advantageous\r\n     offer of countenance and favor.\r\n\r\n                                              London, March 15, 1779.\r\n\r\n     You may remember in some of my former letters I hinted my wish to\r\n     establish a residence in some other part of the continent, or in\r\n     the West Indies, and particularly mentioned to you Antigua--where\r\n     my kinsman, Mr. Wendell, my friend, Mr. David Greene, Dr. Russell\r\n     and his family, Mr. Lavicourt, Mr. Vassall, and others of my\r\n     acquaintance, will give the island less of the appearance of a\r\n     strange place. By the passing of the act of proscription the door\r\n     was shut against me in my own country, where I own it would have\r\n     been my wish to have ended my days. This confirmed my resolution. I\r\n     have since unremittedly pursued various objects, endeavoring to\r\n     drive the nail that would go.\r\n\r\n     My first intention was that of transplanting myself somewhere to\r\n     the southward. On this subject I thought long, and consulted\r\n     others. I considered climate, friends, business, prospects in every\r\n     view, and at last formed my opinion. The provinces in the south\r\n     part of America in point of health were not more favorable than the\r\n     island--in point of friends they might be preferable, but with\r\n     respect to business or the means of acquiring it, uncertain; public\r\n     commotion yet continued, violent prejudices are not easily removed.\r\n     I had neither property nor natural connections in either of them. I\r\n     could have no official influence to sustain me. What kind of\r\n     government or laws would finally prevail it was difficult to tell.\r\n     These and other reasons determined me against the attempt. But to\r\n     stay longer in England, absent from my friends and family, with a\r\n     bare subsistence, inactive, without prospects, and useless to\r\n     myself and the world, was death to me! What was the alternative? As\r\n     I saw no chance of procuring either appointment or employ here, the\r\n     old object of the West Indies recurred, where in my younger days I\r\n     wished to have remained; and by the influence of some particular\r\n     gentlemen I have at last obtained the place of \"Comptroller of the\r\n     Customs at the Port of Parham in Antigua;\" for which island I mean\r\n     to embark with the next convoy. My view is to join the profits of\r\n     business in the line of my profession to the emoluments of office.\r\n     This I flatter myself will afford me a handsome maintenance. I grow\r\n     old too fast to think of waiting longer for the moving of the\r\n     waters, and have therefore cast my bread upon them, thus in hopes\r\n     that at last, after many days, I may find it.\r\n\r\n     Transmit to my father every expression of duty and affection. If he\r\n     retains the same friendship and parental fondness for me I have\r\n     always experienced from him, he will patronize my children, and in\r\n     doing this will do it unto me. It was my intention to have written\r\n     to him, but the subjects on which I want to treat are too\r\n     personally interesting for the casualties of the present day. He\r\n     may rest assured it is my greatest unhappiness to be thus denied\r\n     the pleasing task of lightening his misfortunes and soothing the\r\n     evening of his days. Whatever may be the future events of his life,\r\n     I shall always retain for him the warmest filial respect, and if it\r\n     is my lot to survive him, shall ever think it a pleasure as well as\r\n     my duty to promote to my utmost the welfare of his posterity. My\r\n     mother will also accept of my duty and good wishes; the prosperity\r\n     of the whole household lies near my heart, and they will do me an\r\n     injustice if they think me otherwise than their affectionate\r\n     friend. * * *\r\n\r\n     With respect to my property in America, my wish and desire is, if I\r\n     have any control over it, that my friends there collectively, or\r\n     some one singly under your direction, would take it into their\r\n     hands, and consolidating the debts I owe into one sum, apply it to\r\n     their discharge. I can think of no better way than this. If\r\n     eventually I am deprived of it, I will endeavor to bear it with\r\n     that fortitude which becomes a Christian and philosopher.\r\n\r\n     P. S. I could wish above all things to preserve my law books.\r\n\r\n                              TO HENRY HILL, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                 London, May 25, 1779.\r\n\r\n     I have obtained an appointment at Parham, in Antigua, as\r\n     comptroller of the customs, and am to embark soon for St. Kitts. *\r\n     * It is this day four years since I left Boston, and though I have\r\n     been racked by my own misfortunes and my feelings for the\r\n     distresses of my family and friends, I have still by a good\r\n     Providence been blessed with health and comforted by the kindness\r\n     of many friends. If I have not been in affluence, I have been above\r\n     want, and happy in the esteem of numbers in this kingdom to whom I\r\n     was altogether a stranger. * * The education of my children is\r\n     uppermost in my heart. The giving my son the benefit of classical\r\n     learning by a course of college studies, is a step I much approve.\r\n     The sequestration of my books is more mortifying to me than any\r\n     other stroke. If they are not yet out of your power save them for\r\n     me at all events.\r\n\r\nIn a copy of a letter to a friend, apparently in the West Indies, but\r\nwhose name does not appear, Mr. Quincy thus expresses himself:\r\n\r\n                                         Antigua, Feb. 1, 1782.\r\n\r\n     You ask of me an account of my coming to the West Indies, the\r\n     manner of my existence and destination, &c. The story is long, and\r\n     would require many anecdotes to give the true history, but you will\r\n     excuse me if at present I say only, that in the year 1775, just\r\n     after the battle of Lexington, I quitted America for London on\r\n     motives of business, intending to return in a few months; but my\r\n     absence was construed by our good patriots as the effect of my\r\n     political principles, and improved first to my proscription,\r\n     afterwards to the very flattering title of traitorous conspirator,\r\n     and the confiscation of my estate. I remained in England several\r\n     years, but, tired of waiting for the moving of the waters, and\r\n     unwilling to waste the flower of my age in a state of indolence,\r\n     neither profitable to myself nor my family, I resolved to seek my\r\n     fortune in this part of the world, where I had been in my younger\r\n     days,--obtained a berth in the customs, which, together with the\r\n     emoluments of my profession, afford me a comfortable subsistence,\r\n     and the prospect of something beyond.\r\n\r\n                                      Your friend, &c.,\r\n                                                 SAMUEL QUINCEY.\r\n\r\nMr. Quincy's wife died November, 1782 in Massachusetts. He married again\r\nwhile at Antigua, Mrs. M. A. Chadwell, widow of Hon. Abraham Chadwell.\r\n\r\n              TO HIS SON, SAMUEL QUINCY, JR., CAMBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n                                                      June 10, 1785.\r\n\r\n     How anxious soever I may feel to see my friends and relations once\r\n     more, I cannot think of doing it at the expense of my liberty; nor\r\n     will I ever visit that country where I first drew my breath, but\r\n     upon such terms as I have always lived in it; and such as I have\r\n     still a right to claim from those who possess it,--the character of\r\n     a gentleman. * * * The proposal Judge Sumner has hinted to me of\r\n     keeping his old berth for you at Roxbury, is a good one, at least\r\n     better than Boston. Cultivate his good opinion, and deserve his\r\n     patronage; he will bestow the latter for my sake, I trust, as well\r\n     as his personal esteem for you. It will also stand you in stead at\r\n     court, where I hope you will one day figure as a legislator as well\r\n     as an advocate. All depends upon setting out right. You are at the\r\n     edge of a precipice, or ought to consider yourself so; from whence,\r\n     if you fall, the \"_revocare gradum_,\" is a task indeed. Resolve,\r\n     then, to think right, and act well; keeping up to that resolution\r\n     will procure you daily the attention of all ranks, and command for\r\n     you their respect. Keep alive the cause of truth, of reason, of\r\n     virtue, and of liberty, if I may be permitted to use that name, who\r\n     have by some injuriously been thought in a conspiracy against it.\r\n     This is the path of duty, and will be the source of blessing.\r\n\r\n                                                       July 24, 1789.\r\n\r\n     I am exceedingly sorry to hear of the distracted political\r\n     situation of Massachusetts. * * * A constitution founded on mere\r\n     republican principles has always appeared to me a many-headed\r\n     monster, and, however applauded by a Franklin, a Price, and a\r\n     Priestley, that in the end it must become a suicide. Mankind do not\r\n     in experience appear formed for that finer system, which, in\r\n     theory, by the nice adjustment of its parts promises permanency and\r\n     repose. The passions, prejudice, and interests of some will always\r\n     be in opposition to others, especially if they are in place. This,\r\n     it may be said, is the case in all governments, but I think less so\r\n     in a monarchy than under a republican code. The people at large\r\n     feel an overbalance of power in their own favor; they will\r\n     naturally endeavor to ease themselves of all expenses which are not\r\n     lucrative to them, and retrench the gains of others, whether the\r\n     reward of merit or genius, or the wages of a hireling.\r\n\r\n                                                 Tortola, June 1, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR SON:\r\n\r\n     Your short letter of the 14th February gave me pleasure, as it\r\n     informed me of your health and that of your family, and other\r\n     friends in the neighborhood of Roxbury.\r\n\r\n     It would be my wish to make you a visit once more in my life, could\r\n     it be ascertained I might walk free of insult, and unmolested in\r\n     person. Two things must concur to satisfy me of this,--the repeal\r\n     of the act passed 1779, against certain crown officers, as\r\n     traitors, conspirators, &c.; and accommodation with those who have\r\n     against me pecuniary demands. The first I have never yet learned to\r\n     be repealed, either in whole or in part, and therefore I consider\r\n     it as a stumbling-block at the threshold; the second, no steps I\r\n     suppose have been taken to effect, although I think it might be\r\n     done by inquiry and proposition--with some by a total release from\r\n     demand, and with others by a reasonable compromise. If you ever\r\n     wish your father to repose under your roof, you will take some\r\n     pains to examine the list, and make the trial. I shall shortly, I\r\n     hope, be in a situation to leave this country, if I choose it; but\r\n     whether Europe, of the two objects I have in view, will take the\r\n     preference, may depend on the answer I may receive from you, upon\r\n     the hints I have now thrown out for your consideration and filial\r\n     exertions. * * *\r\n\r\n     I have been, as I informed you in my last, a good deal indisposed\r\n     for some time past. I find myself, however, better on the whole at\r\n     present, though I feel the want of a bracing air. Adieu.\r\n\r\n                              Your affectionate parent,\r\n                                                    SAMUEL QUINCY.\r\n\r\nSoon after the date of this last letter, Mr. Quincy embarked for\r\nEngland, accompanied by his wife. The restoration of his health was the\r\nobject of the voyage, but the effort was unsuccessful; he died at sea,\r\nwithin sight of the English coast. His remains were carried to England,\r\nand interred on Bristol hill. His widow immediately re-embarked for the\r\nWest Indies, but her voyage was tempestuous. Grief for the loss of her\r\nhusband, to whom she was strongly attached, and suffering from the storm\r\nher vessel encountered, terminated her life on her homeward passage.\r\n\r\nIt was a singular coincidence that two of Mr. Quincy's brothers died at\r\nsea, as he did on shipboard, Edmund, the eldest and Josiah, the youngest\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nSamuel Quincy had two sons: Samuel, a graduate of Harvard College in\r\n1782, who was an attorney-at-law in Lenox, Mass., where he died in\r\nJanuary, 1816, leaving a son Samuel. His second son, Josiah, became an\r\neminent counselor-at-law of Romney, N. H., and President of the Senate\r\nof that State.\r\n\r\nMr. Samuel Quincy was proscribed and banished and his property\r\nconfiscated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        COLONEL JOHN MURRAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout 1750 there appeared in Boston society a very handsome man by the\r\nname of Murray, whose antecendents people seemed to be ignorant, when he\r\ncame to this country he settled at Rutland, and was very poor, and at\r\nfirst \"peddled about the country\" and then became a merchant. He was a\r\nman of great influence in his vicinity, and in the town of Rutland,\r\nwhich he represented many years in the General Court. On election days\r\nhis home was open to his friends and good cheer dispensed free to all\r\nfrom his store. His wealth, social position, and political influence,\r\nmade him one of the Colonial noblemen who lived in a style that has\r\npassed away in New England. He was a Colonel in the militia, for many\r\nyears a member of the General Court, and in 1774 was appointed a\r\nMandamus Councillor, but was not sworn into office, because a mob of\r\nabout five hundred, with the \"Worcester Committee of Correspondence,\"\r\nrepaired to Rutland, to compel Colonel Murray to resign his seat in the\r\nCouncil. On the way, they were joined by nearly one thousand persons,\r\namong whom were a portion of the company who had compelled Judge Timothy\r\nPaine to take the same course, marching directly to Rutland the same\r\nday.\r\n\r\nA delegation went to his house, and reported that he was absent. A\r\nletter was accordingly sent to him, to the effect that; unless his\r\nresignation appeared in the Boston papers, he would be waited upon\r\nagain. He abandoned his home on the night of the 25th of August of that\r\nyear, and fled to Boston.\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, there was always a mystery surrounding John\r\nMurray, regarding who he was and where he came from, but his descendants\r\nhad some reason for supposing that he was one of the \"Athol Family\" of\r\nScotland, the surname of the Duke being Murray. Some years since one of\r\nCol. Murray's descendants went to \"Blair Athol,\" the family seat of the\r\nDukes of Athol, hoping to hear something about him, and there found an\r\nold retainer of the family who recalled the fact that many years ago a\r\nyounger member of the family had disappeared, nothing being heard of him\r\nagain, though it was supposed he had run away to America.\r\n\r\nMiss Murray, after her father's death, went from St. John to Lancaster,\r\nMass., to be with her relatives, the Chandler Family. She had with her\r\nsome amount of silver plate, and on each piece was the arms of the\r\n\"Ducal House of Athol.\" She had small means, and when in need of money\r\nused to sell this silver, one piece at a time. In the grant of the town\r\nof Athol by the General Court the first name is that of John Murray, who\r\nprobably gave the name of his ancestral home to the new town.\r\n\r\nIn 1776, with a family of six persons, he accompanied the Royal Army to\r\nHalifax. Col. Murray left a very large estate when he fled from Boston,\r\nand in 1778 he was prosecuted and banished, and in 1779 lost his\r\nextensive property under the Confiscation Act.\r\n\r\nAfter the Revolution, Colonel Murray became a resident of St. John, N.\r\nB. He built a house in Prince William street, with a large lot of land\r\nattached to it, which became very valuable.\r\n\r\nA portrait by Copley is owned by his grandson, the Hon. R. L. Hazen of\r\nSt. John, a member of the Executive Council of New Brunswick. He is\r\nrepresented as sitting in the full dress of a gentleman of the day, and\r\nhis person is shown to the knees. There is a hole in the wig, which is\r\nsaid to have been done by one of the mob who sought the Colonel at his\r\nhouse after his flight, vexed because he had eluded them, vowed they\r\nwould leave their mark behind them, accordingly pierced the canvas with\r\na bayonet.\r\n\r\nColonel Murray married several times, his first wife was Elizabeth\r\nMcLanathan, who was the mother of ten children. His second wife was\r\nLucretia Chandler, the daughter of John and Hannah Gardner, of\r\nWorcester. His third wife was Deborah Brinley, the daughter of Francis\r\nBrinley, of Roxbury.\r\n\r\nColonel Murray was allowed a pension of L200 per annum by the British\r\nGovernment. His estate valued at L23,367, was confiscated except one\r\nfarm for his son Alexander, who joined the Revolutionists. He died at\r\nSt. John, 1794.\r\n\r\nDANIEL MURRAY, of Brookfield, Mass., Son of Colonel John. He graduated\r\nat Harvard College in 1771. Mr. Murray entered the military service of\r\nthe Crown, and was Major of the King's American Dragoons. In 1778 he was\r\nproscribed and banished. At the peace he retired, on half pay. In 1792\r\nhe was a member of the House of Assembly of N. B. In 1803 he left the\r\nColony. In 1832 he died at Portland, Maine.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL MURRAY, Son of Colonel John, graduated at Harvard College in\r\n1772. He was with the British troops at Lexington in 1775, and was taken\r\nprisoner. In a General Order, dated at Cambridge, June 15, 1775, it was\r\ndirected \"That Samuel Murray be removed from the jail in Worcester to\r\nhis father's homestead in Rutland, the limits of which he is not to pass\r\nuntil further orders.\" In 1778 he was proscribed and banished. He died\r\nprevious to 1785.\r\n\r\nRobert Murray, Son of Colonel John. In 1782 he was a Lieutenant of the\r\nKing's American Dragoons. He settled in N. B., and died there of\r\nconsumption in 1786.\r\n\r\nJohn Murray, Son of Colonel John. In 1782 he was a Captain in the King's\r\nAmerican Dragoons. After the Revolution he was an officer of the\r\nFifty-fourth Regiment, British Army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            JUDGE JAMES PUTNAM.\r\n\r\n                   ATTORNEY-GENERAL OF MASSACHUSETTS BAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Putnam, the founder of the Salem family, was born in 1579, at\r\nWingrave, Buckinghamshire, England. He is described in the records an\r\nhusbandman. His farm was at Burstone in Wingrave. He emigrated to Salem\r\nwith his three sons in 1640, where grants of land were made by the town\r\nof Salem to him and to his sons on their own account, in what was then\r\nknown as Salem Village, now the town of Danvers.\r\n\r\nHis sons were Thomas, born 1614, died at Salem Village 1686; Nathaniel,\r\nborn 1619, died at Salem Village 1700; John, born 1627, died at Salem\r\nVillage, 1710.\r\n\r\nIn deeds, John Putnam is described as both husbandman and yeoman. He was\r\na man of substance and of as much education as his contemporaries, but\r\nneither seeking or desiring public office. In 1653 he divided his lands\r\nbetween Thomas and Nathaniel, having evidently already granted his\r\nhomestead to his younger son John. He died in 1662.\r\n\r\nThe subject of this memoir was a descendent of John Putnam, in the fifth\r\ngeneration, through his youngest son John, known as Captain John. It was\r\nin the military affairs and in the witchcraft delusion that his\r\ncharacter is best shown. In 1672 he is styled Corporal, in 1678 he was\r\ncommissioned Lieutenant of the troope of horse at the Village, and after\r\n1687 he is styled \"Captain.\" He served in the Naragansett fight, and\r\nretained his military manners throughout his life. In 1679 and later he\r\nwas frequently chosen to present Salem at the General Court, to settle\r\nthe various disputed town bounds. He was selectman in 1681. He was\r\ndeputy to the General Court for many years previous to the new charter.\r\n\r\nHis residence was on the farm originally occupied by his father, now\r\nbetter known as Oak Knoll, the home of the poet Whittier.\r\n\r\nThe will of John Putnam is not on record. He seems to have disposed of\r\nhis property by deed to his children. Rev. Joseph Green makes the\r\nfollowing note in his diary: \"April 7, 1710, Captain Putnam buried by ye\r\nsoldiers.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT JAMES, son of CAPTAIN JOHN, was born in Salem Village, 1661,\r\nand died there in 1727. He was a farmer, inheriting from his father the\r\nhomestead at Oak Knoll. In 1720 he is styled on the records Lieut.,\r\nwhich title was always scrupulously given him. Although never caring to\r\nhold office, he was evidently esteemed by the townspeople. He had been\r\ntaught a trade, and he in his turn taught his son the same trade, that\r\nof bricklayer. This was a custom among many of the early Puritan\r\nfamilies. It is to the credit of all concerned, that far-sighted and\r\nwealthy men of that day brought up their sons to know a useful trade, in\r\ncase adversity should overtake them.\r\n\r\nJAMES PUTNAM, of the fourth generation, son of the aforesaid Lieut.\r\nJames, was born in Salem Village in 1689, and died there in 1763. He\r\nlived in the house just to the south-east of Oak Knoll on the same road;\r\nthe house is still standing, in a fine state of preservation.\r\n\r\nDuring his long life, James Putnam took considerable interest in town\r\naffairs. He was one of those who succeeded in obtaining the\r\nestablishment of the district of Danvers. In 1730 he paid the largest\r\ntax in the village.\r\n\r\nHONORABLE JAMES PUTNAM, of the fifth generation, son of the aforesaid\r\nJames Putnam, was born in Salem Village, 1726, and died at St. John, N.\r\nB., 1789. He graduated from Harvard College in 1746. In his class was\r\nDr. Edward H. Holyoke, whose father, Edward Holyoke, was then president\r\nof the College. He studied law, under Judge Trowbridge, who according to\r\nJohn Adams, controlled the whole practice of Worcester and Middlesex\r\nCounties, and settled in Worcester in 1749, taking up the practice of\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\nIn 1750 he married Eleanor Sprague, by whom he had one daughter,\r\nEleanor, who married Rufus Chandler, of Worcester.\r\n\r\nJames Putnam, in 1757, held the commission of Major, under Gen. Louden,\r\nand saw service. Between the years of 1755 and 1758, John Adams,\r\nafterwards President of the United States, taught school in Worcester,\r\nand studied law with Mr. Putnam. He also boarded in his family. Mr.\r\nAdams remarks that Mr. Putnam possessed great acuteness of mind, had a\r\nvery extensive and successful practice, and was eminent in his\r\nprofession. James Putnam was one of the twenty signers to the address\r\nfrom the barristers and attorneys of Massachusetts to Gov. Hutchinson,\r\nMay 30, 1774. His brothers, Dr. Ebenezer and Archelaus, both addressed\r\nGov. Gage on his arrival, June 11, 1774. In February, 1775, he, with\r\nothers, was forced by the threatening attitude of the mob to leave\r\nWorcester and seek refuge in Boston, he having had his cattle stolen and\r\na valuable grist mill burned, and threatened with bodily harm.\r\n\r\nOn Oct. 14, 1775, eighteen of those gentlemen who were driven from their\r\nhabitations in the country to the town of Boston, addressed Gov. Gage on\r\nhis departure. Among the signers were James Putnam and James Putnam, Jr.\r\n\r\nIn 1778 the Massachusetts Legislature passed an act confiscating the\r\nestate of 308 Loyalists and banishing them; if they returned a second\r\ntime, to suffer death without the benefit of clergy. Among these was the\r\nHon. James Putnam, who had in 1777 succeeded Jonathan Sewell as attorney\r\ngeneral of Massachusetts, the last under the Crown.\r\n\r\nDuring the siege of Boston on the 17th Nov. 1775, the following order\r\nwas issued by the British Commander: \"Many of his Majesty's Loyal\r\nAmerican subjects having offered their services for the defence of the\r\nplace\" are to be formed into three companies under command of Hon.\r\nBrigadier General Ruggles, to be called the Loyal American Associates,\r\nto be designated by a white sash around the left arm. James Putnam was\r\ncommissioned captain of the second company, and James Putnam, Jr. was\r\ncommissioned second lieutenant of the second company. At the evacuation\r\nof Boston, both James Putnam and his sons, James and Ebenezer,\r\naccompanied the army to Halifax, and New York, where his sons engaged in\r\nbusiness. He sailed for Plymouth, England, December, 1779, with Mrs.\r\nPutnam and his daughter Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nWhile in England he wrote numerous letters to his brothers, from which\r\nwe make the following quotations. Under date of Nov. 13th, 1783, he\r\nwrites from London: \"My countrymen have got their independence (as they\r\ncall it) and with it in my opinion, have lost the true Substantial Civil\r\nliberty. They doubtless exult as much at the acquisition they have\r\ngained as they do at the loss the Tories, as they call them, have\r\nsustained.\"\r\n\r\n\"America, the thirteen states, at last separated from this country,\r\nnever more to be connected. For you may believe me when I say I firmly\r\nbelieve, and on good grounds, that even the present administration would\r\nnot now accept of the connection, if America would offer it on the old\r\nfooting.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may be assured there is nothing I wish for more than to see my dear\r\nbrother and other dear friends in America again.\"\r\n\r\n\"At the same time, I can tell you with truth, unpleasing as you may\r\nthink the situation of the Loyalists to be, I would not change with my\r\nindependent countrymen with all imaginary liberty, but real heavy taxes\r\nand burdens, destitute in a great measure, as I know they are, of order\r\nand good government.\"\r\n\r\n\"Having this view of things, you can't expect to see me in Massachusetts\r\nsoon, even if I was permitted or invited to return with perhaps the\r\noffer of the restoration of my estate. For what would it be worth but to\r\npay all away in taxes in a short time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not yet determined whether to remain in this country or go abroad\r\nto Nova Scotia or elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, under date of July 20, 1784, he writes: \"Your country is so\r\nchanged since I left it, and in my opinion for the worst, that the great\r\npleasure I should have in seeing my dear friends would be lost in a\r\ngreat measure in the unhappy change of government.\"\r\n\r\nHis next letter was from Parr, on the river St. John, N. B., Nov. 18,\r\n1784. He says: \"Dear Brother. I have been at this place about ten days,\r\nam surprised to find a large flourishing town, regularly laid out, well\r\nbuilt, consisting of about two thousand houses, many of them handsome\r\nand well finished--And at the opposite side of the river at Carlton,\r\nabout five hundred more houses on a pleasant situation. A good harbor\r\nlies between the two towns, which never freezes, and where there are\r\nlarge ships and many vessels of all sizes. The country appears to me to\r\nbe very good, and am satisfied will make a most flourishing Province.\"\r\n\r\nHe writes again the next year: \"You may wonder perhaps at my saying I\r\nhope I'm settled in this Province for life, and that I can be contented\r\nor happy in the place formerly called Nova Scotia.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to see you and my friends, if I have any, but I don't wish to\r\nlive in your country or under your government. I think I have found a\r\nbetter. No thanks to the Devils who have robbed me of my property. I do\r\nnot wish to live with or see such infernals.\"\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, your wife, your son, your daughter, my brother, etc.,\r\nwho I shall be glad to see again, but not in the American States.\"\r\n\r\nIn another letter, dated St. John, N. B., May 13, 1785, to his brother,\r\nhe says: \"As to seeing you any more, you have no reason to expect it in\r\nyour State.\r\n\r\n\"You may be assured, I should be exceeding happy in seeing you both\r\nhere. I can give you a comfortable lodging, and wholesome good fresh\r\nprovisions, excellent fish and good spruce beer, the growth and\r\nmanufacture of our own Province.\r\n\r\n\"Tho' we should be glad to see the few friends we have remaining there\r\namong you, we don't wish to give them the pain of seeing us in your\r\nState, which is evidently overflowing with _freedom and liberty_[231]\r\nwithout restraint.\r\n\r\n  [231] During 1785 Shay's rebellion occurred in Massachusetts and was put\r\n  down by General Lincoln.\r\n\r\n\"The people of the States must needs now be very happy, when they can\r\nall and every one do just what they like best. No taxes to pay, no\r\n_stamp act_, _more money_ than they know what to do with, _trade and\r\nnavigation as free as air_.\"\r\n\r\nUnder date of Nov. 4, 1786, he writes: \"The people of your State seem to\r\nbe stirring up another revolution. What do they want now? Do they find\r\nat last, to be freed from the British Government, and becoming an\r\nindependent State does not free them from the debts they owe one\r\nanother, or exempt them from the charge of taxation. I wish they would\r\npay me what they justly owe, they may then have what government they\r\nplease, or none, if they like that best.\"\r\n\r\nHe was appointed in 1784 Judge of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick,\r\nand a member of the Council. It was said that he was the ablest lawyer\r\nin all America. Judge Putnam was the first of the council and bench of\r\nNew Brunswick, who died from failing health; he had not attended council\r\nmeetings for over a year. He died 23 Oct., 1789, in his 65th year. In\r\ncharacter he was upright and generous; his health was never robust; and\r\nloss of country, friends and wealth must have been a severe blow. Sabine\r\nsays: \"I have often stood at his grave and mused upon the strange\r\nvicissitudes of human condition, by which the Master, one of the giants\r\nof the American Colonial Bar, became an outlaw, and an exile, broken in\r\nfortune and spirit, while his struggling and almost friendless pupil,\r\nelevated step by step by the very same course of events, was finally\r\nknown the world over as the Chief Magistrate of a Nation.\" It is thus in\r\nall successful Revolutions, those that were at the head of affairs are\r\nhurled from power, and their fortunes wrecked, whilst young men like\r\nJohn Adams, of great abilities but poor, and little prospects for\r\nadvancement, are elevated to the highest offices. Who would have ever\r\nheard of the \"Little Corporal\" had it not been for the French\r\nRevolution, then there would not have been any \"Napoleon the maker of\r\nKings.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Putnam had two relatives who became famous in the Colonial wars,\r\nand the Revolution. Major-General Israel Putnam was of the fourth\r\ngeneration from John. He was born in Salem Village, 1717. He\r\ndistinguished himself at Crown Point, Montreal and Cuba, and later at\r\nBunker Hill. General Rufus Putnam was of the fifth generation. After\r\nserving in the Colonial wars under his cousin Israel Putnam, he took\r\npart in the siege of Boston, and constructed the works on Dorchester\r\nHeights, on the 4th of March, 1776, that forced the evacuation of\r\nBoston.\r\n\r\nAt no time during the youth of these two men would one have predicted\r\nthat they would be two great soldiers. Their early education was very\r\ndefective, partly because school advantages were then very meagre in the\r\nrural districts, in which they passed their youth, and partly no doubt,\r\nbecause their strong inclinations were for farming and active outdoor\r\nlife, rather than for books and sedentary occupation. Robust and full of\r\nenergy, they were as boys, given to feats of strength and daring.\r\n\r\nIn 1780 General Rufus Putnam \"bought on easy terms\" the confiscated\r\nproperty of Colonel Murray, who married Lucretia Chandler. This property\r\nwas situated in Rutland, and consisted of a large farm and spacious\r\nmansion.\r\n\r\nJAMES PUTNAM, JR., son Judge Putnam, graduated at Harvard College in\r\n1774. He was one of the eighteen country gentlemen who addressed Gen.\r\nGage, and were driven into Boston. He went to England and died there in\r\n1838, having been a barrack master, a member of the household, and an\r\nexecutor of the Duke of Kent, the father of Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      JUDGE TIMOTHY PAINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen Paine, from whom so many of the family in America are descended,\r\ncame from Great Ellingham, near Hingham, Norfolk County, England. He was\r\na miller, and came with a large party of immigrants from Hingham and\r\nvicinity, in the ship Diligent, of Ipswich, John Martin master, in the\r\nyear 1638, bringing with him his wife Rose, two sons and four servants.\r\n\r\nMr. Paine first settled at Hingham, Mass., where he had land granted to\r\nhim, was made a freeman in 1639 and elected Deputy in 1641. In 1642 he,\r\nwith four others, settled at Seekonk, and became prominent in the\r\naffairs of the new settlement at Rehoboth.\r\n\r\nMr. Paine survived the eventful period of King Philip's war and died in\r\n1679, outliving his two sons, Stephen having died at Rehoboth in 1677,\r\nand Nathaniel in 1678.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL PAINE, son of the aforesaid Nathaniel, of the third\r\ngeneration, was born at Rehoboth 1661, married Dorothy, daughter of\r\nJonathan Rainsford, of Boston. He removed in early life to Bristol,\r\nMass., now R. I., and was one of the original proprietors of that place.\r\nIn 1710 he was appointed Judge of the Court of Common Pleas, and Judge\r\nof Probate. He was one of the Council of Mass. Bay from 1703 till his\r\ndeath in 1723, with the exception of the year 1708. Nathaniel Paine died\r\nat Bristol, R. I., in 1723, and his wife Dorothy Rainsford, in 1755.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL PAINE, of the fourth generation and fourth son of the\r\npreceding Nathaniel, was born at Bristol 1688. He was an active and\r\ninfluential citizen of Bristol, was for five years elected\r\nRepresentative. In 1723 he was a member of a Court of Admiralty for the\r\ntrial of pirates. In 1724 was a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas.\r\n\r\nMr. Paine married Sarah, daughter of Timothy Clark of Boston. After his\r\ndeath in 1729, his widow married John Chandler and removed to Worcester.\r\n\r\nTIMOTHY PAINE, son of the aforesaid Nathaniel and Sarah Clark, his wife.\r\nHe was born in Boston in 1730 and married Sarah Chandler in 1749, the\r\ndaughter of John Chandler, so these young people had probably been\r\nbrought up under the same roof from early childhood. He graduated at\r\nHarvard College in 1748, and was a stout government man in the\r\ncontroversies which preceded the Revolution.\r\n\r\nSoon after leaving college, Mr. Paine was engaged in public affairs, and\r\nthe number and variety of offices which he held exhibit the estimation\r\nin which he stood. He was at different times Clerk of the Courts,\r\nRegister of Deeds, Register of Probate, member of the executive council\r\nof the Province, in 1774 he was appointed one of his Majesty's Mandamus\r\nCouncillors, Selectman and Town Clerk, and Representative many years in\r\nthe General Court. In 1771 he was also Special Justice of the Supreme\r\nCourt. Solid talents, practical sense, candor, sincerity, ability, and\r\nmildness, were the characteristics of his life.\r\n\r\nWhen the appeal to arms approached, many of the inhabitants of\r\nWorcester, most distinguished for talents, influence, and honors,\r\nadhered with constancy to the Government. Educated with veneration for\r\nthe sovereign to whom they had sworn fealty; indebted to the government\r\nfor the bounty, honor and wealth which they possessed--loyalty and\r\ngratitude alike influenced them to resent acts that were treasonable,\r\nand rebellious. The sincerity of their motives were attested by the\r\nsacrifice of life, property, loss of power, and all the miseries of\r\nbanishment, confiscation and exile.\r\n\r\nThe struggle between the revolutionist, and the loyalty of a minority of\r\nthe people, powerful in numbers, as well as talents, wealth, and\r\ninfluence, arrived at its crisis in Worcester early in 1774, and\r\nterminated in the total defeat of the loyalists.\r\n\r\nAmong the many grievances of the revolutionists, was the vesting of the\r\ngovernment in the dependents of the King, it aggravated the irritation,\r\nand urged the mobs to acts of violence.\r\n\r\nTimothy Paine, Esq., had received a commission as one of the Mandamus\r\nCouncillors. High as was the personal regard, and respect for the purity\r\nof private character of this gentleman, it was controlled by the\r\npolitical feelings of a period of excitement; and measures were taken to\r\ncompel his resignation of a post which was unwelcome to himself, but\r\nwhich he dared not refuse, when declining would have been construed as\r\ncontempt for the authority of the King, by whom it was conferred.\r\n\r\nAugust 22, 1774, a mob of nearly 3000 persons collected from the\r\nsurrounding towns, visited Worcester and entered the town before 7\r\no'clock in the morning. They chose a committee to wait upon Mr. Paine\r\nand demand his resignation as Councillor. They went to his house, and he\r\nagreed to resign from that office, and drew up an acknowledgement,\r\nmentioning his obligations to the country for favors done him, his\r\nsorrow for having taken the oath, and a promise that he never would act\r\nin that office contrary to the charter, and after that he came with the\r\ncommittee to the common, where the mob made a lane between them, through\r\nwhich he and the committee passed and read divers times as they passed\r\nalong, the said acknowledgment. At first one of the committee read the\r\nresignation of Mr. Paine in his behalf. It was then insisted that he\r\nshould read it with his hat off. He hesitated and demanded protection\r\nfrom the committee, which they were incapable of giving him. Finally,\r\nwith threats of tar and feathers, and personal violence, in which his\r\nwig was knocked off, he complied, and was allowed to retire to his\r\ndwelling unharmed.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the Revolution some American soldiers quartered\r\nat his house repaid his perhaps too unwilling hospitality, and signified\r\nthe intensity of their feelings towards him by cutting the throat of his\r\nfull length portrait.\r\n\r\nMadam Paine, in passing the guard house, which stood nearly where the\r\nold Nashua Hotel stood in Lincoln square, heard the soldiers say \"Let us\r\nshoot the old Tory.\" She turned around facing them and said: \"Shoot if\r\nyou dare,\" and then she reported to General Knox the insult she had\r\nreceived, which was not repeated.\r\n\r\nMrs. Timothy Paine or Madam Paine, as she was styled from respect to her\r\ndignity and position, was a woman of uncommon energy and acuteness. She\r\nwas noted in her day for her zeal in aiding as far as was in her power\r\nthe followers of the crown, and in defeating the plans of the\r\nrebellious colonists. In her the King possessed a faithful ally. In her\r\nhands his dignity was safe, and no insult offered to it, in her\r\npresence, could go unavenged.\r\n\r\nHer wit and loyalty never shone more conspicuously than on the following\r\noccasion: when President Adams was a young man, he was invited to dine\r\nwith the court, and bar, at the home of Judge Paine, an eminent loyalist\r\nof Worcester. When the wine was circulating around the table, Judge\r\nPaine gave as a toast \"The King.\" Some of the Whigs were about to refuse\r\nto drink it, but Mr. Adams whispered to them to comply, saying \"we shall\r\nhave an opportunity to return the compliment.\" At length, when he was\r\ndesired to give a toast, he gave \"The Devil.\" As the host was about to\r\nresent the indignity, his wife calmed him, and turned the laugh upon Mr.\r\nAdams, by immediately exclaiming \"My dear! As the gentleman has been so\r\nkind as to drink to our King, let us by no means refuse in our turn to\r\ndrink to his.\"\r\n\r\nTimothy Paine and Sarah Chandler, his wife, not only feared God, but\r\nhonored the King, so the old record goes. They belonged to families,\r\noften associated together in the remembrance of the present generation,\r\nas having adhered through the wavering fortunes and final success of the\r\nRevolution, devoted and consistent to the British Crown. Solid talents,\r\npractical sense, candor, sincerity, affability, and mildness, were the\r\ncharacteristics of his life. He died July 17, 1793, at the age of\r\nsixty-three. His widow died at Worcester, in 1811.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   DR. WILLIAM PAINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Paine, son of the aforesaid Timothy Paine, was born in\r\nWorcester, Mass., June 5, 1750. He graduated at Harvard College in 1768,\r\nhis name standing second in a class of more than forty, when they were\r\narranged in the catalogue according to the dignity of families.\r\n\r\nHe then began the study of medicine with a very distinguished physician,\r\nDr. Edward A. Holyoke, of Salem, while here he made the acquaintance of\r\nthe lady whom he married a few years later.\r\n\r\nOne of his earliest instructors was John Adams, who was then reading law\r\nin the office of Hon. James Putnam, at Worcester. He began the practice\r\nof medicine in Worcester in 1771. That year Mr. Adams revisited\r\nWorcester, after an absence of sixteen years, and notes the impression\r\nof his former pupils as follows: \"Here I saw many young gentlemen who\r\nwere my scholars and pupils. John Chandler, Esq., of Petersham, Rufus\r\nChandler, the lawyer, and Dr. William Paine, who now studies physics\r\nwith Dr. Holyoke of Salem, and others, most of whom began to learn Latin\r\nwith me.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1771, after about three years of study, he returned to Worcester,\r\nwith every prospect of becoming a leader in the medical profession. In\r\n1773 he entered into partnership with two other physicians or \"Traders\r\nin the Art, Mystery and Business of an Apothecary and the practice of\r\nPhysick.\" This interest was confiscated in 1779.\r\n\r\nIn 1773 Dr. Paine was married to Miss Lois Orne of Salem, with a fortune\r\nof 3,000 pounds sterling. Six children were born from this union.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of facilitating his business abroad and of perfecting\r\nhis medical education, Dr. Paine in Sept. 1774, sailed for England, and\r\nthe following winter was passed in the study of medicine. During his\r\nvisit there he was presented to the King, and Queen Charlotte, wearing\r\nthe court dress prescribed for medical men, which was a gray cloth coat\r\nwith silver buttons, a white satin waistcoat, satin small clothes, silk\r\nhose and wearing a sword, and a fall of lace from cravat or collar, and\r\nlace in the sleeves. It is interesting to read some of his letters\r\nwritten as he was about leaving England. In one of them he writes \"The\r\nColonists had better lay down their arms at once, for we are coming over\r\nwith an overwhelming force to destroy them.\" His wife and children\r\nseemed to have remained with his father and mother while he was in\r\nEngland, but finding their position in Worcester unpleasant on account\r\nof their unpopular political opinions, she left and went to Rhode\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nDr. Paine returned to America in 1775, shortly after hostilities\r\ncommenced, and while there was apparently no legal impediment to his\r\nreturn to Worcester, it was doubtless a very prudent decision of Dr.\r\nPaine not to make the attempt. His feeling of personal loyalty to the\r\ngovernment was too strong to allow him even to appear to yield to the\r\nRevolutionists, then dominating his native town, and he wisely returned\r\nto England. His study of medicine there must have been pursued with\r\nunusual zeal and success, for Nov. 1775, he received from Marischal\r\nCollege, Aberdeen, the degree of M. D.\r\n\r\nSoon after obtaining this distinction, he received an appointment as\r\nApothecary to the British forces in America, and served in Rhode Island\r\nand New York till 1781, when he returned to England, in company with his\r\npatient, Lord Winchelsea. While in England, in 1782, he is said to have\r\nbeen made Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of London.\r\n\r\nOctober 23, 1782, he was commissioned Physician to His Majesty's\r\nHospitals within the district of North America, commanded by Sir Guy\r\nCarleton, and he reported for duty at Halifax, N. S. Letters which have\r\nbeen preserved show that during this year at Halifax he had won the\r\nrespect, friendship and confidence, not only of his immediate medical\r\nsuperior, Dr. Nooth, but also of Lord Wentworth, Governor of the\r\nProvince.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1784, Dr. Paine took possession of La Tete, an island\r\nin Passamaquoddy Bay, granted him by the British Government, for his\r\nservices in the war. He remained there less than one year, and then made\r\nhis residence in St. John, N. B., where he took up the practice of his\r\nprofession. The cause of the removal from the island was the protest of\r\nhis wife that the children could not receive a proper education in that\r\nisolated spot.\r\n\r\nHe was elected member of the Assembly of New Brunswick from the county\r\nof Charlotte, and was appointed Clerk of the House. He was commissioned\r\nas a justice for the county of Sunbury. There is abundant evidence of\r\nthe high estimate placed on his character and ability in the numerous\r\noffices which he held during his residence here.\r\n\r\nJuly 29, 1786, he wrote to a friend: \"I do a great deal of Business in\r\nmy Profession, but I get very little for it. The truth is we are all\r\nvery poor, and the most industrious and economical gets only a bare\r\nsubsistence. However, it will soon be better as the Province is daily\r\nfilling with stock of all kinds.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1787 Dr. Paine made application for leave to visit and reside in New\r\nEngland while remaining on half pay, and a permit to that effect was\r\nissued by the War Office.\r\n\r\nIn Salem he devoted himself to the practice of medicine in the town\r\nwhere he had been known as a student of the famous Dr. Holyoke, and\r\nwhere his wife had spent her early life.\r\n\r\nIn 1793 his father died, and he removed to Worcester, and for the\r\nremaining forty years of his life he resided in the paternal mansion.\r\nHis father's property was large, and as he was not an absentee, it was\r\nnot confiscated. By his will it was equally divided between his\r\nchildren, the farm and homestead covered 1230 acres. Dr. Paine bought\r\nthe shares of his brothers, and sisters in same for 2,000 pounds\r\nsterling, but the deeds were given to Nathaniel Paine in trust for\r\nWilliam, for the doctor was as yet, but an alien in his native state.\r\nThe year 1812 was a critical one, bringing a most important question for\r\nhim to decide, for war arose between Great Britain and the United\r\nStates, and he was still a half-pay officer in His Majesty's service. He\r\ntherefore resigned from the British service, and in 1812 petitioned the\r\nLegislature for its consent to his being a naturalized citizen of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nWilliam Paine was one of the founders of the American Antiquarian\r\nSociety of Worcester. His name was omitted from the act of incorporation\r\nbecause he was an alien. The next year, 1813, he was elected Vice\r\nPresident of same.\r\n\r\nHe occupied the old paternal mansion on Lincoln street in a quiet, very\r\ndignified and almost luxurious manner as befitted a country gentleman.\r\nHere he died at the ripe age of 83, March 19, 1833.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL PAINE, son of Timothy, was born at Worcester, Mass. Graduated at\r\nHarvard College in 1771. The Worcester County Convention, Sept. 7, 1774,\r\nvoted to take notice of Mr. Samuel Paine, assistant clerk, for sending\r\nout _venires_. Voted, that Mr. Samuel Dennison go to Mr. Samuel Paine\r\nforewith, and desire his immediate attendance before this body, to\r\nanswer for sending _venires_ to constables commanding their compliance\r\nwith the late Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nMr. Paine appeared and stated that he felt bound by the duty of his\r\noffice to comply with the Act, \"Voted that Mr. Paine has not given\r\nsatisfaction, and that he be allowed to consider till the adjournment of\r\nthis meeting.\"\r\n\r\nOn September 21, he transmitted a paper to the Convention explanatory of\r\nhis conduct; but that body voted that it \"was not satisfactory, and that\r\n'his letter be dismissed' and Mr. Paine himself 'be treated with all\r\nneglect.'\"\r\n\r\nIn 1775 he was sent to the Committee of Worcester under guard, \"to\r\nWatertown or Cambridge, to be dealt with as the honorable Congress or\r\nCommander-in-Chief shall, upon examination, think proper.\" His direct\r\noffenses consisted, apparently, in saying that the Hampshire troops had\r\nrobbed the home of Mr. Bradish; that he had heard the Whig soldiers were\r\ndeserting in great numbers, and that he was told \"the men were so close\r\nstowed in the Colleges that they were lousy.\" This is the substance of\r\nthe testimony of a neighbor, the only witness who appeared against him.\r\n\r\nIn 1776 Mr. Paine accompanied the British Army to Halifax when they\r\nevacuated Boston. During the war he wandered from place to place without\r\nregular employment. He returned to Worcester where he died in 1807. The\r\nBritish government allowed him an annual pension of L84.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JOHN CHANDLER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe founder of this family, so large and so influential before the\r\nRevolution, came to these shores from England in 1637, when William\r\nChandler and Annice, his wife, settled in Roxbury. Mr. Chandler died in\r\n1641, \"having lived a very religious and godly life,\" and \"leaving a\r\nsweet memory and savor behind him.\" Annice Chandler must have been an\r\nattractive woman, for she was not only soon married to a second husband,\r\nbut to a third, and her last one evidently expected her to enter into\r\nmatrimony a fourth time, for in his will he provided that she shall have\r\nthe use of his warming pan only so long as she remained his widow.\r\nGoodwife Parmenter, however, died in 1683, in full possession of the\r\nwarming pan, the widow of the third husband.\r\n\r\nJOHN CHANDLER, a son of William, emigrated to Woodstock, Conn., and\r\nbecame a farmer. He was selectman and deacon of the church, and died\r\nthere in 1703, leaving a family and property valued at L512.\r\n\r\nThe second John Chandler, son of the first of that name, had before his\r\nfather's death, moved to New London, Conn., where he married, and in\r\n1698 had opened a \"house of entertainment\" there. He at a later date\r\nmoved back to South Woodstock, and in 1711 was chosen representative to\r\nthe General Court at Boston for several years. After the erection of\r\nWorcester County by Act of the Legislature of Massachusetts, April 2,\r\n1731, the first Probate Court in Worcester was held by Col. Chandler as\r\nJudge in the meeting house, 13th of July, 1731, and the first Court of\r\nCommon Pleas and General Sessions on August 10 following, by the Hon.\r\nJohn Chandler, commissioned June 30, 1731, Chief Justice. These offices\r\nhe held until his death, as well as Colonel of Militia to which stations\r\nof civil, judicial and military honors, he rose by force of his strong\r\nmental powers, with but slight advantages of education. Judge John\r\nChandler died August 10, 1743, in his 79th year, leaving in his will\r\nL8,699.\r\n\r\nJOHN CHANDLER, the third of that name, son of the Hon. John Chandler,\r\nheld nearly all the offices in the town of Worcester, Selectman,\r\nSheriff, Probate Judge, Town Treasurer, Register of Probate, Register of\r\nDeeds, Chief Judge of County Courts, Judge of Common Pleas,\r\nRepresentative to the General Court, Colonel of Militia and a member of\r\nthe Governor's Council. He died in 1762, wealthy and full of honors.\r\n\r\nJUDGE CHANDLER, was married to Hannah Gardner, daughter of John Gardner\r\nof the Isle of Wight (known afterwards as Gardner's Island), in 1716.\r\nShe died in Worcester in 1738, aged 39 years, leaving nine children, the\r\nfirst members of the Chandler family who were born and bred in\r\nWorcester.\r\n\r\nJOHN CHANDLER, son of the aforesaid, the fourth to bear that name was\r\nborn in New London, Connecticut, in 1720, was married twice and had\r\nsixteen children. His father removed to Worcester when he was eleven\r\nyears of age. At his father's death he succeeded him to the principal\r\ncounty offices. He was Colonel in the militia, and was in service in the\r\nFrench war, and he was Sheriff, Judge of Probate and County Treasurer.\r\nUp to 1774 John Chandler's life had been one of almost unbroken\r\nprosperity, but when the rebellion broke out, his loyalist sentiments\r\nbrought upon him the wrath of the mob, and he was compelled to leave\r\nhome, and family and retire to Boston. When Boston was evacuated, he\r\nwent to Halifax, and thence to London, and two years after he was\r\nproscribed and banished. He sacrificed his large possessions, L36,190 as\r\nappraised in this country by commissioners here, to a chivalrous sense\r\nof loyalty. In the schedule exhibited to the British Commissioners,\r\nappointed to adjust the compensation to the Americans who adhered to the\r\ngovernment; the amount of real and personal property which was\r\nconfiscated, is estimated at L11,067, and the losses from office, from\r\ndestruction of business, and other causes, at nearly L6,000 more. So\r\njust and moderate was this compensation ascertained to be, at a time\r\nwhen extravagant claims were presented by others, that his claim was\r\nallowed in full; he was denominated in England \"The Honest Refugee.\"\r\nSabine says \"I am assured that, while he was in Boston he was supported\r\nfor a considerable time by the sale of silver plate sent him by his\r\nfamily; and that when he left home he had no idea of quitting the\r\ncountry. I am assured also, that when the Revolutionary Commissioners\r\ntook an inventory of his household furniture, the females were plundered\r\nof their very clothing.\" His adherence to the government, and his\r\ndeparture for England, seems to have been his only offences, yet he was\r\ntreated as harshly as though he had borne arms in the field.\r\n\r\nHe is spoken of as having a cheerful temperament, engaging in manner,\r\nhospitable as a citizen, friendly and kind as a neighbor, industrious\r\nand enterprising as a merchant, and successful as a man of business. He\r\ndied in London in 1800, and was buried in Islington churchyard. In 1741\r\nhe married Dorothy, daughter of Colonel Nathaniel Paine. She died in\r\n1745. His second wife was Mary, daughter of Colonel Church, of Bristol,\r\nR. I., a descendant of the warrior who fought King Philip. She died at\r\nWorcester in 1783. His portrait in oil is preserved in the rooms of the\r\nAmerican Antiquarian Society, Worcester. George Bancroft, the\r\ndistinguished historian, and the widow of Governor Davis of\r\nMassachusetts, are Colonel Chandler's grandchildren.\r\n\r\nCLARK CHANDLER, son of Colonel John, was born at Worcester in 1743. At\r\nfirst a clerk in the office of the Register of Probate, he became joint\r\nRegister with Hon. Timothy Paine, and held the appointment from 1766 to\r\n1774. He was also Town Clerk of Worcester from 1768 to 1774. In 1774 he\r\nentered upon the town Records a remonstrance of the Loyalists to the\r\ngreat anger of the Revolutionists, who voted in town meeting that he\r\nshould then and there \"obliterate, erase, or otherwise deface, the said\r\nrecorded protest, and the names thereto subscribed, so that it may\r\nbecome illegible and unintelligible.\" This he was obliged to do, in\r\npresence of the revolutionists, to blot out the obnoxious record by\r\ndipping his fingers in ink, and drawing them over the protest.\r\n\r\nHe left home in June, 1775, and went to Halifax, and thence to Canada.\r\nHe returned in September of the same year, and was imprisoned in the\r\ncommon jail. Confinement impaired his health, and he was removed to his\r\nmother's home. Finally he was allowed to go to Lancaster, on giving\r\nsecurity that he would not depart from that town. He returned to\r\nWorcester and kept store at the corner of Main and Front streets. His\r\nperson was small, and he wore bright red small clothes; was odd and\r\nsingular in appearance, which often provoked jeers and jokes of those\r\naround him, but apt at reply \"he paid the jokers in their own coin.\" He\r\nwas never married, and died in Worcester in 1804.\r\n\r\nRUFUS CHANDLER, fifth child of Colonel John by Mary Church, his second\r\nwife. He was born in 1747, and graduated at Harvard College in 1776 in a\r\nclass of forty, with the rank of the fourth in \"dignity of family.\" He\r\nread law in the office of his uncle, Hon. James Putnam, in Worcester,\r\nwhere he afterwards practised his profession until the courts were\r\nclosed by the mobs in 1774. He was one of the barristers and attornies\r\nwho addressed Hutchinson in the last mentioned year. He inherited the\r\nloyalty of his family and left the country at the commencement of\r\nhostilities. He went to Halifax in 1776 and in 1778 was proscribed and\r\nbanished. His mother used a part of his estate for the support of his\r\ndaughter; but the remainder appraised at L820, was confiscated. He\r\nresided in England as a private gentleman, and died in London in 1823,\r\nat the age of 76, and his remains were laid with those of his fathers in\r\nIslington churchyard. His wife was Elizabeth Putnam, his only child, who\r\nbore her mother's name, married Solomon Vose, of Augusta, Maine.\r\n\r\nGARDNER CHANDLER, son of Colonel John, of Hardwick, Mass., was born in\r\n1749, and was a merchant in that town. His property was confiscated, and\r\nthe proceeds paid into the treasury of the state. He left the colony and\r\nreturned some time after to Hardwick. He made acknowledgments\r\nsatisfactory to his townsmen, it was voted by the town \"that as Gardner\r\nChandler has now made acknowledgment, and says he is sorry for his past\r\nconduct, that they will treat him as a friend and neighbor, so long as\r\nhe shall behave himself well.\" He removed to Brattleboro, Vermont, and\r\nagain to Hinsdale, N. H. He died in the last named town. His wife was\r\nElizabeth, daughter of Brigadier Timothy Ruggles.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL CHANDLER, son of Colonel John, was born in Worcester, 1750,\r\ngraduated at Harvard College in 1768. He was a pupil of John Adams, and\r\ncommenced the practice of law in Petersham. His brother-in-law, the Rev.\r\nDr. Bancroft, wrote \"that he possessed personal manliness and beauty,\"\r\nthat \"he was endowed with a good mind and a lively imagination\" that \"in\r\ndisposition he was cheerful.\" He was one of the eighteen county\r\ngentlemen who addressed General Gage on his departure in 1775. In 1776\r\nhe went to Halifax. In 1778 he was proscribed and banished, and his\r\nestate confiscated. Entering the British service he commanded a corps of\r\nVolunteers and did good service. He returned to Petersham in 1784, and\r\nengaged in trade, but relinquished business on account of ill health,\r\nand returned to Worcester. Citizenship was restored in 1789, by Act of\r\nthe Legislature of Mass. He was a very pleasant companion, and a\r\nfavorite singer of songs in social parties. He never married. He died at\r\nWorcester in 1801.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM CHANDLER, eighth child of Colonel John, was born at Worcester in\r\n1752, and graduated at Harvard College in 1772. At that time students in\r\nthat institution were ranked according to \"dignity of family\" and\r\nWilliam was placed in the highest class. He was one of the eighteen\r\ncounty gentlemen who were driven from their homes to Boston, and who\r\naddressed General Gage on his departure in 1775. In 1776 he went to\r\nHalifax. He was proscribed and banished under the Act of 1778, but\r\nreturned to Mass., after the close of the Revolution. Among the articles\r\nin the inventory of his estate when it was confiscated was seven pairs\r\nof silk hose, at fourteen shillings; plated shoe buckles, six shillings;\r\nand pair of velvet breeches.\r\n\r\nGardiner Chandler, brother of Colonel John. He was born in Woodstock in\r\n1723. In the French war he was a major and was in service at the\r\nsurrender of Fort William Henry. He was Treasurer of Worcester County\r\neight years and succeeded his brother John, as sheriff, in 1762. He\r\npresented General Gage an Address in behalf of the Judges of the Court\r\nof Common Pleas in 1774; and was compelled by a Convention of the\r\nCommittee of Correspondence to sign a \"Recantation.\" In time, he\r\nregained the confidence of the community, and was suffered to live\r\nundisturbed. He died in Worcester, in 1782. His first wife was Hannah\r\nGreene, of Providence, R. I., his second, Ann Leonard, of Norton, Mass.\r\n\r\nThe Chandlers were in every respect the most eminent family in Worcester\r\nCounty, and furnished many men of distinction in its ante-revolutionary\r\nhistory. They were closely allied by blood, marriage or friendship with\r\nthe aristocracy of the county and province, in which they had unbounded\r\nsway. They had large possessions, and shared with the Paine family (with\r\nwhom they were allied), the entire local influence at Worcester, but did\r\nnot, like that family, survive the shock of the Revolution, and retain a\r\nlocal habitation and a name. Their property was confiscated and they\r\nwere declared traitors.\r\n\r\nThe family was broken up; some members of it went abroad and died there,\r\nothers were scattered in this country, yet not a few of their\r\ndescendants eminent in the most honorable pursuits, and in the highest\r\npositions in life under different names and in various localities,\r\nrepresent that ancient, honorable and once numerous race, wrecked by the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams says in his diary, \"The Chandlers exercised great influence\r\nin the County of Worcester until they took the side of the government in\r\nthe Revolution, and lost their position. They were well bred, agreeable\r\npeople, and I visited them as often as my school, and my studies in the\r\nlawyer's office would admit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              JOHN GORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Gore, of Roxbury, and his wife Rhoda, were both church members in\r\n1635. He died June 2, 1657, and his widow married Lieut. John Remington.\r\nHe had ten children, of whom John, Samuel, Abigail, Mary, Mylam, and\r\nHannah, were mentioned in his will.\r\n\r\nSamuel Gore, son of the former, lived in Roxbury, and was a carpenter.\r\nHe married August 28, 1672, Elizabeth, daughter of John Weld. He died\r\nJuly, 1692. They had seven children.\r\n\r\nObadiah Gore, son of Samuel, was also a carpenter, and lived in Boston.\r\nHe married, October 26, 1710, Sarah Kilby. He died October 8, 1721, and\r\nwas survived by five children, all of whom were baptized at the Brattle\r\nStreet church.\r\n\r\nJOHN GORE, son of the former, lived in Boston, and was a painter and\r\nmerchant. He married, May 5, 1743, Frances, daughter of John Pinkney.\r\nShe was born September 20, 1726. They had fourteen or fifteen children,\r\nnine of whom lived to be married. The baptisms of nine of his children\r\nare given in the records of the Brattle Street Church. John Gore was an\r\nAddresser of Gage, and in 1776 went to Halifax and thence to England. He\r\nwas proscribed and banished in 1778, and pardoned by the Legislature in\r\n1787. He died in Boston in 1796, aged seventy-seven. His will is in the\r\nSuffolk Register, Lib. 94, F. 182. His son, CHRISTOPHER GORE, was born\r\nin Boston, Sept. 21st, 1758. He was educated in the public schools of\r\nBoston, and was prepared at the South Latin school under the tuition of\r\nMr. Lovell, the most noted educator of his day. At the age of 13,\r\nChristopher entered Harvard College, and was among the youngest of his\r\nclass. But he commenced his collegeate course in troubleous times, for\r\nin his junior year the Revolution broke out, which created confusion and\r\ndisorder through society, and deranged the plans, and changed the\r\npursuits of many in every grade and profession. The College at Cambridge\r\nwas considered by the Revolutionists as \"nest of tories\" and during the\r\nsiege of Boston the college buildings were taken possession of by the\r\ncontinental army stationed at Cambridge, and the students were dispersed\r\nfor several months. Young Gore was determined to follow out his course\r\nof college training, however, and to this end went to Bradford, in Essex\r\nCounty, and studied under the direction and in the family of Rev. Mr.\r\nWilliams, afterwards professor of mathematics and natural philosophy in\r\nHarvard College. When the college removed to Concord he, with most of\r\nthe students, repaired thither, and resumed his studies. He graduated in\r\n1776, the year that his father was driven from the land of his birth.\r\n\r\nChristopher Gore soon commenced the study of law in the office and under\r\nthe direction of Judge John Lowell, in whose family he resided while a\r\nstudent. He commenced the practice of law in Boston with every prospect\r\nof success. He had to depend on himself alone, for not only had he his\r\nown fortune to make, but after he left college, he had to contribute to\r\nthe support of his mother and three unmarried sisters, who were left in\r\nBoston without means when his father went to Halifax.\r\n\r\nBy his own exertion and industry, he paid his college bills after he\r\nentered on his profession, in addition to his other responsible duties,\r\ndevolving upon him with honor to himself. During 1809-10 Mr. Gore was\r\nGovernor of Massachusetts. While Governor, he occupied the home corner\r\nof Park and Beacon streets, and it is said he drove through the streets\r\nof Boston in a carriage drawn by four horses. This was more than the\r\nplain republican people of Boston could stand, and they did not want him\r\nfor Governor again, besides it is undeniable that Mr. Gore was a good\r\ndeal of an aristocrat at heart, and consequently more or less a\r\nloyalist. But he made a fine administrator, and at the end of the term\r\nretired to private life, and did not resume the practice of his\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nIn 1791 Christopher Gore purchased in Waltham about 1000 acres of land\r\nwhich formerly belonged to an ancestor of President Garfield. Here\r\nGovernor Gore erected a stately mansion upon a knoll or rise of the land\r\nnot far distant from Gore street, where one of the drives, leading to\r\nit, runs under rows of stately trees, and through a finely kept lawn. In\r\nthe rear of the house are the flower gardens, and conservatory, and\r\nbehind that the kitchen garden; to the west of this is the deer park.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Governor Gore this stately structure was sold to\r\nGeneral Theodore Lyman, who after living there seven years sold it to\r\nSingleton Copley Greene, the son of Gardner Green, who married a\r\ndaughter of Copley the artist, the sister of Lord Lyndhurst: (see p.\r\n216.) Christopher Gore married Rebecca Payne, 11 Nov. 1783. They had no\r\nchildren. Gov. Gore died 1 March 1827, his widow 22 Jan. 1833.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            JOHN JEFFRIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Jeffries was born at Rhoad, in Wiltshire, England, 1658, and\r\narrived at Boston, May 9, 1677. He married Sept. 15, 1686, Elizabeth,\r\ndaughter of John and Elizabeth Usher, by whom he had several children.\r\nOf his two sons, John, born Feb. 5, 1688, and David, born June 15, 1690,\r\nJohn became Town Treasurer, was a very prominent citizen. He married\r\nSept. 24, 1713, Anne Clarke, and had issue, an only child Anne, who died\r\nyoung. He went to London in 1710, and returned in 1713. He resided in\r\nTremont Street opposite the King's Chapel.\r\n\r\nDavid Jeffries Jr., who continued the name, married in 1713, Katherine,\r\ndaughter of John and Katherine Eyre, by whom he had an only child David,\r\nborn 23 Oct. 1714. He was a merchant, and in 1715 he sailed for England,\r\nand was lost in the Amity, Sept. 13, 1716, on the sands near Dungeness.\r\nHis son,\r\n\r\nDAVID JEFFRIES, married his cousin, Sarah Jaffrey, 1741, by whom he had\r\neight children, all of whom died young except John, born Feb. 4, 1744,\r\nalone preserved the name.\r\n\r\nJOHN JEFFRIES, the only son of the former, graduated from Harvard\r\nCollege in 1763, having pursued his medical studies with Doctor Lloyd.\r\nHe continued his study of medicine in London, and was honored with the\r\ndegree of M. D. at Aberdeen in 1769. In 1771 he was appointed surgeon to\r\nthe \"Captain\" a British Ship-of-the-line in Boston Harbor, by his\r\nfriend, Admiral Montague. He held that position until 1774.\r\n\r\nDr. Jeffries practised in Boston until the Revolution. He landed with\r\nthe forces at the battle of Bunker Hill, and assisted in dressing the\r\nwounded of the Royal Army, and, it is said, identified the body of\r\nWarren, in the presence of Sir William Howe. He accompanied the British\r\ntroops at the evacuation in 1776 to Halifax, and was appointed Chief of\r\nthe Surgical Staff of Nova Scotia. In 1779 he went to England; and on\r\nhis return to America, held a high professional employment to the\r\nBritish forces at Charleston and New York. He resigned in 1780, and\r\ngoing to England again, commenced practice in London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. JOHN JEFFRIES.\r\n\r\nBorn in Boston, Feb. 4, 1774. In his balloon costume. Dr. Jeffries and\r\nBlanchard were the first to cross from England to France in a balloon.\r\nDied in Boston Sept. 16, 1819.]\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of January, 1785, Dr. Jeffries crossed the English channel\r\nwith Blanchard in a balloon, landing in the forest of Guines in France.\r\nThis feat procured for him the attention of the most distinguished\r\npersonages of the day and an introduction to all the learned and\r\nscientific societies of Paris.[232]\r\n\r\n  [232] A narrative of his two aerial voyages was published In London in\r\n  1786, exact and entertaining, with a portrait of the adventurer and a\r\n  view of the monument erected by the French government, on the spot where\r\n  he landed.\r\n\r\nDr. Jeffries' first wife was Sarah Rhoads, whom he married in 1770. By\r\nher he had three children, who died unmarried. He married again, Sept.\r\n8, 1787, Hannah, the daughter of William and Hannah Hunt. In 1790 Dr.\r\nJeffries returned to Boston in the ship Lucretia.\r\n\r\nHe resumed his practice, and delivered the first public lecture on\r\nanatomy, a branch of his profession of which he was very fond.[233] He\r\nwas eminent as a surgeon, midwife and physician. He attended the poor as\r\nfaithfully and cheerfully as the rich, and was never known to refuse a\r\nprofessional call. His death occurred in Boston, September 16th, 1819,\r\naged 76 years, after a successful practice of fifty-three years.\r\n\r\n  [233] Curwen's Journal, P. 537.\r\n\r\nDr. Jeffries had by his second wife eleven children, all of whom died\r\nunmarried excepting John, Katherine who married G.

Hist. & General Reg., Vol. 15, P. 16.\r\n\r\nJohn Jeffries, son of the doctor, was born March 23, 1796, and became\r\nthe only representative of the name in the city. He was a distinguished\r\nphysician in Boston. He married, November 8, 1820, Anne Geyer, daughter\r\nof Rufus Greene and Ann (McLean) Amory. His children were Catherine,\r\nAnne, Sarah, Augustus, Edward P. and Henry N. Jeffries.\r\n\r\nGeorge Jaffrey, an elder son of Dr. John Jeffries the loyalist, was born\r\nDecember 21, 1789. George Jaffrey, his grand-uncle, who graduated from\r\nHarvard College in 1736, became a Counsellor and held various important\r\npositions in Portsmouth, N. H. He married Lucy, the daughter of Adam\r\nWinthrop, but had no issue. His loyalty to the crown involved him in\r\ntrouble several times, but he died in 1802 leaving property, then a\r\nlarge amount to George Jaffrey Jeffries, on condition that \"he should\r\ndrop the name of Jeffries; become a permanent resident of Portsmouth,\r\nand never follow any profession except that of being a gentleman.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Jaffrey made his home in Portsmouth and for many years was\r\nlibrarian of the Portsmouth Athenaeum. He died May 4, 1856, and a\r\nmerited tribute was paid to his character and his labors by Mr. Brewster\r\nin the Portsmouth Journal of the 10th.[235]\r\n\r\n  [235] New Eng.

This was about fourteen years after the settlement of that\r\nplace, and Francis Brinley held various offices; among them that of\r\nJudge. He occasionally resided in Boston, owning a large estate at the\r\ncorner of Hanover and Elm streets. He died there in 1719, aged\r\neighty-seven, and was buried in a grave in the King's Chapel\r\nburial-ground in Boston, on the spot where the family tomb now stands.\r\n\r\nThomas, son of the latter, was one of the founders of King's Chapel and\r\nresided in Boston. He married Mary Apthorp, and in 1684 went to England,\r\nwhere he died in 1693. His daughter Elizabeth married William\r\nHutchinson, Esq., a graduate of Harvard College, in 1702. Mrs. Brinley,\r\nFrancis and Elizabeth, returned to Newport, R. I.\r\n\r\nFrancis Brinley, the son of Thomas, was born in London in 1690, and was\r\neducated at Eton. He became a colonel and resided in Roxbury. His\r\nmansion was named Datchet from the house of that place in England.\r\nColonel Brinley returned to London, where he died November 27, 1765.\r\nFrancis Brinley's wife was Deborah, daughter of Edward and Catherine\r\nLyde, and his marriage took place April 18, 1718. They had five sons and\r\ntwo daughters; one of whom married Colonel John Murray, and the other\r\nGodfrey Malbone.\r\n\r\nOf the sons, THOMAS BRINLEY was a Mandamus Councillor, and lived on\r\nHarvard Street. He married his cousin Elizabeth, the daughter of George\r\nCradock, but they left no children. He was a graduate of Harvard College\r\nin 1744, and became a Merchant in Boston.\r\n\r\nHis name appears among the one hundred and twenty-four merchants and\r\nothers, who addressed Hutchinson in Boston in 1774; and among the\r\nninety-seven gentlemen and principal inhabitants of that town, who\r\naddressed Gage in October of the following year. In 1776 he went to\r\nHalifax, and thence to England in the same year. In 1778 he was\r\nproscribed and banished. His death occurred in 1784, and Elizabeth, his\r\nwidow, died in England in 1793.\r\n\r\nEDWARD BRINLEY, brother of Thomas, married Sarah, daughter of Thomas\r\nTyler and left many descendants.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL BRINLEY, another brother, also married his cousin, Catharine\r\nCradock, was a resident in South Street and at one time lived in\r\nFramingham. About 1760 he leased the \"Brinley Farm\" of Oliver DeLancey,\r\nagent of the owner, Admiral Sir Peter Warren, of the Royal Navy, and as\r\nis said, employed fifteen or twenty negroes, in its cultivation. It is\r\nrelated that Daniel Shays, the leader of the insurrection in 1786, was\r\nin the service of Mr. Brinley on this farm. In 1775 he was an Addresser\r\nof Gage, and was ordered, in consequence, to confine himself to his own\r\nleasehold. He fled to the Royal Army in Boston, and after the evacuation\r\nof that town, he was sent to Framingham by sentence of a Court of\r\nInquiry, ordered to give bond in L600, with two sureties, to remain\r\nthere four months and to be of good behavior.\r\n\r\n\"In September 1776, Ebenezer Marshall, in behalf of the Committee of\r\nCorrespondence, Inspection and Safety, represented that the 'people take\r\nhim for a very villain,' as he had declared that 'Parliament had an\r\nundoubted right to make void the charter in part or in whole'; 'that ten\r\nthousand troops, with an artillery, would go through the continent, and\r\nsubdue it at pleasure'; that he had conveyed 'his best furniture to\r\nRoxbury, and moved his family and goods into Boston,' and had himself\r\nremained there, 'as long as he could have the protection of the British\r\ntroops;' that he approved of General Gage's conduct in the highest\r\nterms;' that 'his most intimate connections were some of our worst\r\nenemies and traitors;' and that, while he had been under their\r\ninspection, they had seen nothing 'either in his conduct or disposition,\r\nthat discovers the least contrition, but otherwise.'\"[236]\r\n\r\n  [236] Sabine's Loyalists, Vol. 1, P. 256.\r\n\r\nTo some of these allegations, Mrs. Brinley replied in two memorials to\r\nthe General Court. She averred that, by the conditions of the\r\nrecognizance, her husband was entitled to the freedom of the whole of\r\nthe town of Framingham; that he was in custody on the sole charge of\r\naddressing Gage; and that instead of being a refuge in Boston, he was\r\nshut up in that town while accidentally there, etc. She stated that he\r\nat one time had been compelled to work on John Fisk's farm, without\r\nliberty to go more than twenty rods from the house unless in Fisk's\r\npresence; and that he was denied the free use of pen, ink and paper. She\r\nsaid that after Mr. Brinley had been transferred to the care of Benjamin\r\nEaton, he was not allowed to go from the house, and was fearful that his\r\ndeparture from it would occasion the loss of his life; also that she or\r\nany other person was not allowed to converse with him, unless in the\r\nhearing of some member of Eaton's family. She urged that he might be\r\nremoved to some other inland town, and be treated in accordance with his\r\nsentence. Mr. Brinley's defence of himself seems to have been the simple\r\nremark: \"I am a gentleman and have done nothing to forfeit that\r\ncharacter.\" He merely had a rational opinion, but that was enough.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th September, 1776, the General Court, by resolve, committed\r\nhim to the care of his father, on security in L600 for his appearance;\r\nand, in October of the same year, the committee of Framingham reported\r\nto the council that they had disposed of his farm, stock, farm-utensils\r\nand household furniture. Nathaniel Brinley removed to Tyngsborough,\r\nwhere his son Robert, married Elizabeth, daughter of John Pitts. This\r\nstaunch loyalist died at that place in 1814, at the age of eighty-one.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF CONFISCATED ESTATES BELONGING TO THOMAS BRINLEY IN SUFFOLK\r\n                        COUNTY AND TO WHOM SOLD.\r\n\r\n     To Gustavus Fellows, Sept. 28, 1782; Lib. 136, fol. 11; Land,\r\n       dwelling-house, distill house and wharf in Boston, Hollis St. S.;\r\n       heirs of Joshua Henshaw deceased W.; low water mark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            REV. JOHN WISWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn and Thomas Wiswell were early residents of Dorchester. John's name\r\nis found in the records as early as 1634. His brother Thomas came to\r\nDorchester about 1635. Noah, son of Thomas, born in 1640, was a military\r\nman, and was in command in the desperate battle with the Indians near\r\nWheelwright's Pond, N. H., where he and his son John were killed, July\r\n6th, 1690. Another son of Thomas, Inchabod, born in 1637, was minister\r\nof Duxbury. He had a son Peleg, born in 1683, who was schoolmaster at\r\nCharlestown in 1704. John Wiswell, son of Peleg, married Elizabeth,\r\ndaughter of Dr. Samuel Rogers, graduated from Harvard College in 1705,\r\nwas a master of a Boston Grammar School in 1719. He died in 1767, aged\r\n84 and is buried in Copps Hill burying ground.\r\n\r\nJOHN WISWELL, son of the aforesaid, was born in 1731, and graduated from\r\nHarvard College in 1749. In 1753 he was teaching school in Maine, but he\r\npursued the study of divinity as a Congregationalist. Occasionally he\r\npreached, and in 1756 he was invited to become the pastor of the New\r\nCasco parish in Falmouth, now Portland, and was ordained November third\r\nof that year. In 1761 he married Mercy, the daughter of Judge John\r\nMinot, of Brunswick.\r\n\r\nIn 1764 John Wiswell suddenly changed his religious views and left his\r\npeople. He embraced the Episcopal form of worship, and preached for\r\nseveral Sundays in the town-house. On September 4, 1764, the Parish of\r\nSt. Paul's Church, Falmouth, was organized and Mr. Wiswell was invited\r\nto become their rector. For want of a bishop in the colonies, he was\r\nobliged to go to England to receive ordination. A writer at this time\r\nsays, \"There was a sad uproar about Wiswell, who has declared for the\r\nchurch and accepted of the call our churchmen have given him to be their\r\nminister.\" They voted him L100 a year and later he received L20 as a\r\nMissionary from the Missionary Society. After a year's elapse, he was\r\nable to report to the Society in London for the propagation of the\r\nGospel in Foreign Parts, that his Congregation had increased to seventy\r\nfamilies, and the admittance of twenty-one persons to the communion. In\r\n1765 the parish addressed a letter to the Rev. Mr. Hooper of Boston,\r\nasking his good offices in enlisting the sympathy of the churchmen\r\nthere, in behalf of their oppressed fellow-worshippers in Falmouth. John\r\nWiswell was an ardent Loyalist, as were about twenty of the leading men\r\nof his church. He continued to preach until the revolution broke out.\r\nAfter the trouble came in the colonies, he was seized while out walking\r\none day with Captain Mowatt, by Colonel Samuel Thompson of Brunswick,\r\nwho had arrived with about fifty men unknown to the inhabitants. Colonel\r\nThompson refused to release Mr. Wiswell, and Captain Mowatt, but finally\r\nseeing that the town was against him, he consented to release them if\r\nthey would give their parole to deliver themselves up next day. After\r\nhis capture, the clergyman was obliged to declare his abhorrence of the\r\ndoctrine of passive obedience and non-resistance, and was then released.\r\nMr. Wiswell now joined the British Forces, and after going on board a\r\nman-of-war addressed a letter to the wardens of his church, resigning\r\nhis charge. After Captain Mowatt burned Falmouth, he sailed to Boston,\r\nand then to England. After leaving his parish he was for three years a\r\nchaplain on the British Naval Ship Boyne, and later for a short time was\r\na curate in Suffolk. He and fifteen others from Falmouth had their\r\nestates confiscated, and were banished.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the war, Mr. Wiswell accepted the call of some of his\r\nformer parishioners, and settled in Cornwallis, Nova Scotia, over a\r\nparish they had formed there, and in 1782 he was appointed a missionary\r\nof that place. Having lost his first wife, he married a widow Hutchinson\r\nfrom the Jerseys, as the Rev. Jacob Bailey, the frontier missionary\r\nwrites, who married them. John Wiswell was afterwards a missionary at\r\nAylesford, and after a very full and worthy life, died at Nova Scotia in\r\n1812, at the age of eighty-one. He left two sons, born in Falmouth, who\r\nwere Lieutenants in the Navy. Peleg, one of his sons, was appointed\r\nJudge of the Supreme Court, of Nova Scotia, in 1816 and died at\r\nAnnapolis in 1836, at the age of seventy-three. When the Rev. John\r\nWiswell lived in Falmouth, Maine, he occupied a house painted red, which\r\nstood on the corner of Middle and Exchange Streets, afterwards owned and\r\noccupied by James Deering, and which gave place to the brick block built\r\nby that gentleman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             HENRY BARNES.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Barnes, and his wife Elizabeth (Perrie) came to Boston about 1710.\r\nHe was a prominent merchant, and was in partnership with John Arbuthnot,\r\nwho married Abigail Little, of Pembroke, in 1719, and whose daughter\r\nChristian married Henry, the son of John Barnes, Sept. 26, 1746. John\r\nBarnes was a prominent Episcopalian, was vestryman of King's Chapel from\r\n1715 to 1724, warden from 1724 to 1728, was the first mentioned of the\r\ntrustees concerned in the purchase of land for Christ Church, and\r\nafterwards of those who bought of Leonard Vassal, Esq., his estate on\r\nSummer street (see p. 286) for the building of Trinity Church. His home\r\nin Boston was on the north side of Beacon street, extending from Freeman\r\nPlace to Bowdoin Street, a portion of which is now occupied by the Hotel\r\nBellevue, he purchased this property in 1721, and died, seized of it. In\r\n1756 it was conveyed by John Erving (see p. 298) to James Bowdoin.\r\n\r\nJohn Barnes died early in 1739 at Clemente Bar, St. Mary Co., Maryland.\r\nHis wife died in 1742 in Boston.\r\n\r\nAmong their children was Elizabeth, who married Nathaniel Coffin the\r\nCashire (see p. 234). Among their distinguished children were General\r\nJohn Coffin and Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin, of the British Navy.\r\n\r\nCatherine, another daughter, born in 1715, married Colonel Thomas\r\nGoldthwaite (see p. 356). She was his second wife, and died at\r\nWalthamstow, England, 1796, aged 81.\r\n\r\nHENRY BARNES. The subject of this memoir was baptized Nov. 20, 1723. He\r\nwas brought up in his father's business, and established himself as a\r\nmerchant in Marlborough, Mass., in 1753, and was appointed magistrate.\r\nHe was possessed of considerable property, and was one of the largest\r\ntax payers in the town, and was the owner of several slaves, one of whom\r\n\"Daphne,\" he left in Marlborough, and she was supported out of his\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nHenry Barnes was thoroughly loyal, and for that reason he was probably\r\nthe best hated man in Marlborough. A late town history says Marlborough\r\nwas cursed by a Loyalist named Henry Barnes.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of February, 1775, General Gage ordered Captain Brown\r\nand Ensign D'Bernicre to go through the Counties of Suffolk and\r\nWorcester, and to sketch the roads as they went, for his information, as\r\nhe expected to march troops through that country the ensuing spring.\r\nTheir adventures after their departure for Marlborough, are related by\r\none of them as follows:\r\n\r\n\"At two o'clock it ceased snowing a little, and we resolved to set off\r\nfor Marlborough, which was about sixteen miles off. We found the roads\r\nvery bad, every step up to our ancles; we passed through Sudbury, a\r\nlarge village near a mile long; the causeway lies over a great swamp, or\r\noverflowing of Sudbury river, and is commanded by a high ground on the\r\nopposite side. Nobody took the least notice of us, till we arrived\r\nwithin three miles of Marlborough, (it was snowing very hard all the\r\nwhile,) when a horseman overtook us, and asked us from whence we\r\ncame--we said from Weston; he asked us if we lived there--we said no; he\r\nthen asked where we resided, and, as we found there was no evading his\r\nquestions, we told him we lived in Boston. He then asked us where we\r\nwere going: we told him to Marlborough, to see a friend; (as we intended\r\nto go to Mr. Barnes's, a gentleman to whom we were recommended, and a\r\nfriend to the Government;) he then asked us, if we were of the army; we\r\nsaid no, but were a good deal alarmed at his asking us that question; he\r\nasked several rather impertinent questions, and then rode on for\r\nMarlborough, as we suppose, to give them intelligence of our coming--for\r\non our arrival the people came out of their houses (though it snowed and\r\nblew very hard) to look at us; in particular, a baker asked Capt. Brown,\r\n'Where are you going, Master?' He answered, 'To see Mr. Barnes.'[237]\r\n\r\n  [237] The horseman that met them was Col. Timothy Bigelow, of the\r\n  Committee of Safety.\r\n\r\n\"We proceeded to Barnes's, and on our beginning to make an apology for\r\ntaking the liberty to make use of his house, and discovering to him that\r\nwe were officers in disguise, he told us that we need not be at the\r\npains of telling him, that he knew our situation, that we were very well\r\nknown, he was afraid, by the town's people. We begged he would recommend\r\nsome tavern where we should be safe; he told us we would be safe no\r\nwhere but in his house; that the town was very violent, and that we had\r\nbeen expected at Col. Williams's tavern, the night before, where there\r\nhad gone a party of liberty people to meet us. While we were talking,\r\nthe people were gathering in little groups in every part of the town\r\n(village).\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Barnes asked us who had spoken to us on our coming into town; we\r\ntold him a baker; he seemed a little startled at that, told us that he\r\nwas a very mischievous fellow, and that there was a deserter at his\r\nhouse. Capt. Brown asked the man's name; he said it was Sawin, and that\r\nhe had been a drummer. Brown knew him too well, as he was a man of his\r\nown Company, and had not been gone above a month; so we found we were\r\ndiscovered. We asked Mr. Barnes, if they did get us into their hands\r\nwhat they would do with us; he did not seem to like to answer; we asked\r\nhim again; he then said, he knew the people very well, that we might\r\nexpect the worst treatment from them.\r\n\r\n\"Immediately after this, Mr. Barnes was called out; he returned a little\r\nafter, and told us the Doctor of the town had come to tell him, he was\r\ncome to sup with him, (now this fellow had not been within Mr. Barnes's\r\ndoors for two years before, and came now for no other business than to\r\nsee and betray us). Barnes told him he had company, and could not have\r\nthe pleasure of attending him that night; at this the fellow staid about\r\nthe house, and asked one of Mr. Barnes's children, who her father had\r\ngot with him; the child innocently answered, that she had asked her\r\npapa, but he told her it was not her business; he then went, I suppose,\r\nto tell the rest of his crew.\r\n\r\n\"When we found we were in that situation, we resolved to lie down for\r\ntwo or three hours, and set off at twelve o'clock at night; so we got\r\nsome supper on the table, and were just beginning to eat, when Mr.\r\nBarnes, who had been making inquiries of his servant, found the people\r\nintended to attack us; he then told us plainly, that he was very uneasy\r\nfor us, that we could be no longer in safety in the town; upon which we\r\nresolved to set off immediately, and asked Mr. Barnes if there was no\r\nroad round the town, so that we might not be seen. He took us out of his\r\nhouse by the stable, and directed us by a by-road which was to lead us a\r\nquarter of a mile from the town; it snowed and blew as much as I ever\r\nsaw in my life. However, we walked pretty fast, fearing we should be\r\npursued; at first we felt much fatigued, having not been more than\r\ntwenty minutes at Barnes's to refresh ourselves, and the roads were\r\nworse, if possible, than when we came; but in a little time it wore off,\r\nand we got on without being pursued, as far as the hills which command\r\nthe causeway at Sudbury, and went into a little wood, where we eat a bit\r\nof bread that we took from Barnes's, and eat a little snow to wash it\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\"A few days after our return, Mr. Barnes came to town from Marlborough,\r\nand told us that immediately after our quitting town, the Committee of\r\nCorrespondence came to his house, and demanded us; he told them we were\r\ngone; they then searched his house from top to bottom, looking under the\r\nbeds and in the cellar, and when they found we were gone, they told him,\r\nif they had caught us in his house, they would have pulled it down about\r\nhis ears. They sent horsemen after us on every road, but we had the\r\nstart of them, and the weather being so very bad, they did not overtake\r\nus, or missed us. Barnes told them we were not officers, but relatives\r\nof his wife's from Penobscot, and were going to Lancaster; that perhaps\r\ndeceived them.\"\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives, November, 1775, the \"Petition of Henry\r\nKnox[238] humbly showeth. That your petitioner having been obliged to\r\nleave all his goods and home furniture in Boston, which he has no\r\nprospect of ever getting possession of again, nor any equivalent for the\r\nsame, therefore begs the Honorable Court, if in their wisdom see fit, to\r\npermit him to exchange house furniture, with Henry Barnes, late of\r\nMarlborough, which he now has in his power to do.\" The prayer was\r\nrefused, but he was allowed to _use_ the Loyalist's goods, on giving\r\nreceipt to account for them to the proper authorities.\r\n\r\n  [238] Subsequently Chief of Artillery in the Revolutionary Army, and\r\n  Secretary at War under Washington.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1775, Catherine Goldthwaite prayed the interposition of the\r\nGeneral Court, stating in a petition that she was the niece and adopted\r\nheir of Barnes; that she had resided with him about seventeen years,\r\nthat at his departure from town, she was left with a part of his family\r\nin possession, and that the committee of Marlborough had entered upon\r\nhis estate, sold a part, and proposed to dispossess her entirely. No\r\nredress could be obtained.\r\n\r\nThrough the violence of the mob Henry Barnes was forced to seek shelter\r\nin Boston early in 1775. From there he went to England. In 1777 he was\r\nat Bristol with his wife and niece, and in September thirteen of his\r\nfellow Loyalists were his guests, and later still in the same year he\r\ndined with several of the Massachusetts exiles at Mr. Lechmere's, when\r\nthe conversation was much about the political condition of their native\r\nland.\r\n\r\nMr. Barnes was proscribed and banished, and his estate confiscated. He\r\ndied at London in 1808, at the age of eighty-four.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THOMAS FLUCKER.\r\n\r\n                     Secretary of Massachusetts Bay.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fluckers were descended from a French Huguenot family who settled in\r\nEngland. Captain James Flucker, mariner, came to America and married\r\nElizabeth Luist at Charlestown, Mass., May 30, 1717. He was taxed there\r\nfrom 1727 to 1756 and died 3 Nov. 1756. She died Sept. 1770. They had\r\neight children.[239]\r\n\r\n  [239] See Life of Henry Knox by F. G. Drake, P. 125.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS FLUCKER, son of the aforesaid, was born at Charlestown, 9 Oct.\r\n1719. He was a merchant in Boston and owned an estate on Summer street.\r\nHe was commissioned a Justice of the Peace 14 Sept. 1756, was a member\r\nof the Council in 1761-68. A Selectman of Boston in 1766, succeeded\r\nAndrew Oliver as Secretary, 12 Nov. 1770, was made a Mandamus Councillor\r\n9 Aug. 1774. He married 1st, 12 June 1744, Judith, daughter of Hon.\r\nJames Bowdoin, a Boston Huguenot family, and as a testimony to the\r\npublic spirit of this famous family, Bowdoin College remains. 2nd, 14\r\nJan. 1751, he married Hannah, daughter of General Samuel Waldo,\r\nproprietor of the Waldo Patent Main, to whose heirs the great domain\r\ndescended. The portion belonging to Mrs. Flucker and her brother, were\r\nconfiscated.\r\n\r\nThomas Flucker was a staunch Loyalist. He was banished and his estates\r\nconfiscated. He left Boston at the evacuation, March 17, 1776, for\r\nHalifax. He afterwards went to London, where he was a member of the\r\nBrompton Row Association of Loyalists, who met weekly for conversation\r\nand a dinner. An extract from Hutchinson's Diary, July 13, 1776, says:\r\n\r\n\"Flucker dined with us; depends on the truth of the report of his\r\nfamily's being arrived in Ireland; has 300L allowed by treasury; last\r\n(?) of the Council 200L.\" Thomas Flucker died in England suddenly on\r\nFeb. 16, 1783. His wife remained in England, but survived him only three\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS FLUCKER, of Massachusetts, son of the former, graduated at\r\nHarvard University in 1773. During the Revolution he was a Lieutenant in\r\nthe 60th British regiment at St. Augustine, Fla., in 1777. By the\r\nUniversity catalogue, it appears that he and his father died the same\r\nyear, 1783.\r\n\r\nLUCY FLUCKER, another child, born 2 August 1756, married General Henry\r\nKnox of the revolutionary army, and afterwards Secretary at War. The\r\nyoung rebel had at the time a flourishing bookstore opposite Williams\r\nCourt in Cornhill, a fashionable morning resort at that time for the\r\nBritish officers and their ladies. Harrison Gray Otis says that Miss\r\nLucy \"was distinguished as a young lady of high intellectual endowments,\r\nvery fond of books, especially of the books sold by Knox, at whose\r\npremises was kindled as the story went, 'the guiltless flame' which was\r\ndestined to burn on the hymeneal altar.\" Henry Knox became Chief of\r\nArtillery in the Revolution, and in Washington's Administration,\r\nSecretary of War. He acquired on easy terms, a very large share of Mrs.\r\nFlucker's property, which had been confiscated, and settled on it at\r\nThomaston, Maine, building a fine mansion in which he himself died in\r\n1806, and his wife in 1824.\r\n\r\nSally Flucker, another daughter of Thomas Flucker, Jr., who performed\r\nin Burgoyne's \"Maid of the Oaks\" in private theatricals given by British\r\nofficers in Boston, accompanied the family to England and married Mr.\r\nJephson, a member of the Irish Parliament. Copley painted her portrait.\r\n\r\nHannah Flucker, daughter of Thomas, married 2 Nov. 1774, James Urquhart,\r\ncaptain in the 14th regiment, which was engaged in the battle of Bunker\r\nHill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MARGARET DRAPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard Draper and his brother William emigrated to the Colonies and\r\nsettled at Boston about 1680. He was a merchant in that city. The Boston\r\nRecords state that Richard Draper and John Wentworth furnished the\r\nlumber from which Faneuil Hall was built. In his will he says that he is\r\nthe son of Edward and Ann Draper, of Branbury, in the County of Oxford,\r\nGreat Britain, deceased, and only brother to William Draper Senr. of\r\nBoston. This will was probated Jan. 25th, 1728.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1700 the Postmaster of Boston was one John Campbell, a\r\nScotchman, and son of Duncan Campbell, the organizer of the postal\r\nsystem of America. He was also a bookseller. In those early days the\r\ndissemination of news was in the hands of the postmasters of each town,\r\nand John Campbell on Monday, April 24, 1704, improved the present system\r\nby _printing the news_. He issued the first number of the Boston \"News\r\nLetter,\" the first newspaper issued in America. The first sheet of the\r\nfirst number was taken damp from the press by Chief Justice Sewell, to\r\nshow to President Willard, of Harvard College, as a wonderful curiosity.\r\nBartholomew Green, eldest son of Thomas Green, printer to Cambridge\r\nUniversity, was the printer. He obtained possession of the newspaper in\r\n1721, shortly after Campbell was removed from the post-office in Boston.\r\nOn his death in 1733, it passed into the hands of his son-in-law, John\r\nDraper, son of Richard Draper, who continued to publish it until his\r\ndeath in 1762, when he was succeeded by his son Richard Draper, who\r\nchanged the title to the \"Massachusetts Gazette and Boston News Letter.\"\r\nHe was brought up a printer by his father, and continued with him after\r\nhe became of age, and was for some years before his father's death a\r\nsilent partner with him. He was early appointed printer to the Council\r\nand Government, which he retained during life. Under his successful\r\neditorship, the paper was devoted to the Government, and in the\r\ncontroversy with Great Britain, he strongly supported the Loyalists\r\ncause, and illustrated the head of his paper with the King's Arms. Many\r\nable advocates of the Government filled the columns of the \"News-Letter\"\r\nbut the opposition papers were supported by writers at least equally\r\npowerful and numerous.\r\n\r\nThe Drapers were considered the most eminent and successful printers in\r\nAmerica. A list of works containing their imprints would fill pages.\r\n\r\nRichard Draper was a man of feeble health, and was remarkable for the\r\ndelicacy of his mind and gentleness of his manner. No stain rests on his\r\ncharacter. He was attentive to his affairs, and was esteemed as the best\r\ncompiler of news of his day. Having been successful in his business and\r\nacquired a competency, he erected a handsome brick home on a convenient\r\nspot in front of the old printing home in Newbury, now Washington\r\nstreet, where he resided, and which was afterwards confiscated. He died\r\nJune 6th, 1774, aged 47, without children, and was succeeded by his\r\nwidow, Margaret, who was a granddaughter of Bartholomew Green.\r\n\r\nA month before his death, he had taken John Boyle into partnership, but\r\nat the outbreak of hostilities, his sympathies being strong for the\r\nRevolutionary cause, he was not agreeable to Widow Margaret, and was\r\nsucceeded in the partnership by John Howe, who was a devoted loyalist,\r\nand continued with her until the final suspension of the paper, which\r\noccurred on the evacuation of Boston, by the British troops, when\r\nMargaret departed with the soldiers, going first to Halifax and thence\r\nto England, where she enjoyed a pension from the British Government for\r\nthe remainder of her life, in return for her loyalty and devotion to the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nMargaret Draper's paper was the only one published in Boston during the\r\nsiege. It had been published without intermission for 72 years. She died\r\nin London in 1807, and was included in the confiscation and banishment\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF CONFISCATED ESTATES BELONGING TO MARGARET DRAPER IN SUFFOLK\r\n                       COUNTY AND TO WHOM SOLD.\r\n\r\n     To Richard Devens, Feb. 7, 1783; Lib. 137, fol. 48; Land and\r\n       buildings in Boston, Newbury St. W.; heirs of Benjamin Church S.\r\n       and E., Josiah Waters, Jr. N.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RICHARD CLARKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard Clarke was the son of Francis Clarke, merchant, a descendant of\r\nan old Boston family. Richard graduated at Harvard College in 1729. He\r\nand his sons were the consignees of a part of the tea destroyed in\r\nBoston by the celebrated \"Tea Party\" December 1773. In a letter from\r\nMessrs. Clarke & Sons to Mr. Abram Dupuis they say: \"On the morning of\r\nthe 2nd inst. about one o'clock, we were roused out of our sleep by a\r\nviolent knocking at the door of our house, and on looking out of the\r\nwindow we saw (for the moon shone very bright) two men in the courtyard.\r\nOne of them said he brought us a letter from the country. A servant took\r\nthe letter from him at the door, the contents of which was as follows:\r\n\r\n                                                  Boston, 1st Nov., 1773.\r\n     Richard Clarke & Son:\r\n\r\n     The Freemen of this Province understand from good authority, that\r\n     there is a quantity of tea consigned to your house by the East\r\n     India Company, which is destructive to the happiness of every well\r\n     wisher to the country. It is therefore expected that you personally\r\n     appear at Liberty Tree, on Wednesday next, at twelve o'clock at\r\n     noon day, to make a public resignation of your commission,\r\n     agreeable to a notification of this day for that purpose.\r\n\r\n     Fail not upon your peril.\r\n                                                        O. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In this you may observe a design to create a public belief that the\r\nfactors had consented to resign their trust on Wednesday, the 3d inst.,\r\non which day we were summoned by the above-mentioned letter, to appear\r\nat Liberty Tree at 12 o'clock noon. All the bells of the meeting houses\r\nfor public worship were set a-ringing at 11 o'clock, and continued\r\nringing till twelve; the town cryer went thro' the town summoning the\r\npeople to assemble at 'Liberty Tree.' By these methods, and some more\r\nsecret ones, made use of by the authors of this design, a number of\r\npeople supposed by some to be about 500, and by others more, were\r\ncollected by the time and place mentioned in the printed notification.\r\n\r\n\"They consisted mostly of people of the lowest rank, very few reputable\r\ntradesmen, as we are informed, appeared amongst them. The gentlemen who\r\nare supposed the designed factors for the East India Company, viz: Mr.\r\nThos. Hutchinson, Mr. Faneuil, Mr. Winslow and Messrs. Clarke, met in\r\nthe forenoon of the 3rd inst., at the latter's warehouse, the lower end\r\nof King street. You may well judge that none of us entertained the least\r\nthought of obeying the summons sent us to attend at Liberty Tree. After\r\na consultation amongst ourselves and friends, we judged it best to\r\ncontinue together, and to endeavour, with the assistance of a few\r\nfriends, to oppose the designs of the mob, if they should come to offer\r\nus any insult or injury. And on this occasion we were so happy as to be\r\nsupported by a number of gentlemen of the first rank. About one o'clock,\r\na large body of people appeared at the head of King Street, and came\r\ndown to the end, and halted opposite to our warehouse. Nine persons came\r\nfrom them up into our counting room, viz., Mr. Molineux, Mr. Wm. Dennie,\r\nDoctor Warren, Dr. Church, Major Barber, Mr. Henderson, Mr. Gabriel\r\nJohonnot, Mr. Proctor and Mr. Ezekiel Cheever. Mr. Molineux as speaker\r\nof the above Committee, addressed himself to us, and the other gentlemen\r\npresent, and told us that we had committed an high insult on the people,\r\nin refusing to give them that most reasonable satisfaction which had\r\nbeen demanded in the summons which had been sent us, then read a paper\r\nproposed by him, to be subscribed by the factors importing, that they\r\nsolemnly promise that they would not land or pay duty on any tea that\r\nshould be sent by the East India Company, but they would send back the\r\ntea to England in the same bottom, which extravagent demand being firmly\r\nrefused, and treated with proper contempt by all of us. Mr. Molineux\r\nthen said that since we had refused their most reasonable demands, we\r\nmust expect to feel, on our first appearance, the utmost weight of the\r\npeople's resentment, upon which he and the rest of the committee left\r\nour counting room and warehouse, and went to, and mixed, with the\r\nmultitude that continued before our warehouse. Soon after this the mob\r\nhaving made one or two reverse motions to some distance, we perceived\r\nthem hastening their pace towards the store, on which we ordered our\r\nservant to shut the outward door; but this he could not effect, although\r\nassisted by some other persons amongst whom were Nathaniel Hatch, Esq.,\r\none of the Justices of the inferior Court for this country, and a\r\nJustice of the Peace for the county. This gentleman made all possible\r\nexertions to stem the current of the mob, not only by declaring\r\nrepeatedly, and with a loud voice, that he was a magistrate, and\r\ncommanded the people, by virtue of his office, and in his Majesty's\r\nname, to desist from all riotous proceedings, and to disperse, but also\r\nby assisting in person; but the people not only made him a return, of\r\ninsulting and reproachful words, but prevented his endeavors by force\r\nand blows, to get our doors shut, upon which Mr. Hatch, with some other\r\nof our friends, retreated to our counting room. Soon after this, the\r\noutward doors of the store were taken off their hinges by the mob, and\r\ncarried to some distance; immediately a number of the mob rushed into\r\nthe warehouse, and endeavoured to force into the counting room, but as\r\nthis was in another story, and the staircase leading to it narrow, we,\r\nwith our friends,--about twenty in number--by some vigorous efforts,\r\nprevented their accomplishing their design. The mob appeared in a short\r\ntime to be dispersed, and after a few more faint attacks, they contented\r\nthemselves with blocking us up in the store for the space of about an\r\nhour and a half, at which time, perceiving that much the greatest part\r\nof them were drawn off, and those that remained not formidable, we, with\r\nour friends, left the warehouse, walked up the length of King Street\r\ntogether, and then went to our respective homes without any molestation,\r\nsaving some insulting behavior from a few dispicable persons.\r\n\r\n\"The night following, a menacing letter was thrust under Mr. Faneuil's\r\ndoor, to be communicated to the other consignees, with a design to\r\nintimidate them from executing their trust, and other methods have since\r\nbeen made use of in the public papers and otherwise, for the same\r\npurpose.\"[240]\r\n\r\n  [240] \"Tea Leaves,\" pp. 282, 3, 4, 5, 6.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of November 17, 1773, a little party of family friends\r\nhad assembled at the home of Richard Clarke, Esq., near the King's\r\nChapel on School Street, to welcome young Jonathan Clarke, who had just\r\narrived from London. All at once the inmates of the dwelling were\r\nstartled by a violent beating at the door, accompanied with shouts and\r\nthe blowing of horns, creating considerable alarm. The ladies were\r\nhastily bestowed in places of safety, while the gentlemen secured the\r\navenues of the lower story, as well as they were able. The yard and\r\nvicinity were soon filled with people. One of the inmates warned them\r\nfrom an upper window, to disperse, but getting no other reply, than a\r\nshower of stones, he discharged a pistol. Then came a shower of\r\nmisseles, which broke in the lower windows and damaged some of the\r\nfurniture. Some influential Revolutionists had by this time arrived, and\r\nput a stop to the proceedings of the mob, which then dispersed. The\r\nconsignees then called upon the governor and council for protection.\r\n\r\nThe eventful Thursday, December 16, 1773, a day ever memorable in the\r\nannals of Boston, witnessed the largest mob yet assembled in Boston.\r\nNearly seven thousand persons collected at the Old South Meeting House.\r\nThe tea ships had not taken out clearance papers, the twenty days\r\nallowed by law terminated that night. Then the revenue officers could\r\ntake possession, and under cover of the naval force, land the tea, and\r\nopposition to this would have caused bloody work. The Revolutionists\r\ndesired to avoid this issue, so it was decided to destroy the tea.\r\nRotch, the owner of the \"Dartmouth,\" applied to Governor Hutchinson, at\r\nhis residence in Milton, for a pass to proceed with his vessel to\r\nLondon, for the governor had ordered Colonel Leslie, commander of the\r\ncastle, and Admiral Montagu, to guard the passages to the sea, and\r\npermit no unauthorized vessels to pass. The governor offered Rotch a\r\nletter to Admiral Montagu, commending ship and goods to his protection,\r\nif Rotch would agree to have his ship haul out into the stream, but he\r\nreplied that none were willing to assist him in doing this, and the\r\nattempt would subject him to the ill will of the people. The governor\r\nthen sternly refused a pass, as it would have been \"a direct\r\ncountenancing and encouraging the violation of the acts of trade.\"\r\n\r\nBetween six and seven o'clock in the evening three different mobs\r\ndisguised as Indians proceeded from different parts of the town, arrived\r\nwith axes and hatchets, and hurried to Griffin's (now Liverpool wharf),\r\nboarded the three tea ships, and, warning their crews and the custom\r\nhouse officers, to keep out of the way, in less than three hours time\r\nhad broken and emptied into the dock three hundred and forty-two chests\r\nof tea, valued at L18,000. A Loyalist writer of the time says: \"Now this\r\ncrime of the Bostonians, was a compound of the grossest injury and\r\ninsult. It was an act of the highest insolence towards government, such\r\na mildness itself cannot overlook or forgive. The injustice of the deed\r\nwas also most atrocious, as it was the destruction of property to a vast\r\namount, when it was known that the nation was obliged in honor to\r\nprotect it.\" This memorable occurrence was undoubtedly in the immediate\r\nsequence of the events which it produced, the proximate cause of the\r\nAmerican Revolution.[241]\r\n\r\n  [241] See Page 48 for further particulars concerning the Tea Party Mob.\r\n\r\nRichard Clarke was treated with much severity by the Revolutionists. His\r\nname is found with the Addressers of General Gage. He arrived in London\r\nDecember 24, 1775, after a passage of \"only\" twenty-one days from\r\nBoston. He was one of the original members of the Loyalist Club, for a\r\nweekly dinner, and discourses. He lived with his son-in-law, Copley the\r\npainter, Leicester Square. Lord Lyndhurst was his grandson. He died in\r\nEngland in 1795.\r\n\r\nJONATHAN CLARKE, son of Richard Clarke, accompanied his father to\r\nEngland. He was his father's partner in business. He was a member in\r\n1776 of the Loyalists Club, in London, and had lodgings in Brompton Row\r\nthe next year. In 1778 he was proscribed and banished. After the\r\nRevolution he went to Canada.\r\n\r\nISAAC WINSLOW CLARKE, son of Richard Clarke, was born in Boston, 27\r\nOctober, 1746. He was sent by his father to Plymouth to collect debts,\r\nbut in the night was assaulted by a mob and obliged to flee from the\r\ntown, to escape from personal injuries. He became Commissary-General of\r\nLower Canada, and died in that Colony in 1822, after he had embarked for\r\nEngland. His daughter Susan married Charles Richard Ogden, Esq.,\r\nSolicitor-General of Lower Canada, in 1829.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PETER JOHONNOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Johonnots in America are of French Huguenot origin. Daniel Johonnot,\r\nwho was born in France about 1668, was one of the first parties of\r\nthirty families that arrived in Boston in 1686. He was in company with\r\nhis uncle Andrae Sigournie, Distiller, from Rochelle, and went with him\r\nto Oxford in New England, remaining there until the settlement was\r\nbroken up by the incursion of Indians August 25, 1696. Jean Jeanson\r\n(John Johnson) and his three children were killed during the massacre.\r\nMrs. Johnson was Andrew Sigourney's daughter, and tradition in the\r\nJohonnot family relates that she was rescued at that time from the\r\nIndians by her cousin, Daniel Johonnot, to whom she was subsequently\r\nmarried.[242]\r\n\r\n  [242] New England Hist. and Genealogical Register. Vol. 6. P. 357.\r\n\r\nThe first record we have of Daniel Johonnot in Boston was at the time of\r\nhis marriage \"on the 18th of April, by the Rev. Samuel Willard of the\r\nOld South Church, to Susan Johnson.\" This was in the year 1700. In 1714\r\nit appears by the Suffolk Records he purchased for L300 \"current money,\"\r\nof John Borland and Sarah his wife, an estate near the Mill Creek and\r\nbounded by Mill Pond, and the street leading to said pond (Union Street)\r\netc. His last purchase of real estate was near the Old South Church and\r\nthis land was afterwards occupied by one of the descendants of his\r\ndaughter Mary, Mary Anne (Boyer), number 156 Washington street, opposite\r\nthe Province House. At the time of Daniel Johonnot's death it was\r\noccupied by his grandson, and must have been Mr. Johonnot's last\r\nresidence, as in an inventory it is described as being in the possession\r\nof Mr. Daniel Boyer. In Mr. Johonnot's French Bible, Amsterdam Edition\r\nof 1700, are recorded the births of his six children in French, all\r\nchildren of Daniel and Serzane Johonnot. This Bible later came into the\r\npossession of one of his descendants. Daniel Johonnot died in Boston in\r\nJune, 1748 at the age of eighty years. His wife died some time after\r\n1731, and before the death of her husband. He was remembered as being a\r\nfriend to the poor, always industrious and frugal.\r\n\r\nZacherie (Zachariah) Johonnot, the eldest son of the preceding was born\r\nin Boston January 20, 1700-1. His first wife was Elizabeth Quincy, who\r\ndied during the revolution, and he married again, April 24, 1777,\r\nMargaret Le Mercier, daughter of Andrew Le Mercier, Minister of the\r\nFrench Protestant church in Boston.\r\n\r\nLike his father he was a Distiller and engaged in mercantile pursuits.\r\nHis dwelling house and store was on Orange street at the South part of\r\nthe town, and his distillery was on Harvard street directly opposite his\r\ndwelling. At the end of the same street was his wharf, and wooden\r\ndistil-house, storehouses, etc. His house and store were burnt at the\r\ntime of the great fire, April 20, 1787. The spacious gardens filled with\r\nrare fruit trees, beautiful flowers and shrubs from his father's land\r\nwere mostly destroyed.\r\n\r\nMr. Johonnot died in Boston in 1784 at the age of eighty-three. To his\r\nson Peter (then in England) he bequeathed \"his mansion house, store\r\nadjoining, yard and garden, as the same is now fenced in, etc.\" He had\r\nten children, all by his first wife.\r\n\r\nPETER JOHONNOT, the fourth child of the preceding, was born in Boston\r\nSeptember 23, 1729. He was married January 10, 1750 to Katherine Dudley\r\nby the Rev. Mather Byles. She was the daughter of the Honorable William\r\nDudley (son of Governor Joseph Dudley). Peter Johonnot was a Distiller,\r\nand lived in Boston. In 1775 he was an Addresser of Gage. The next year\r\nhe was one of the committee with Thomas and Jonathan Amory, chosen by\r\nthe citizens of Boston March 8, 1776, to communicate with General Howe\r\nand take measures to avert the impending destruction, threatened by him,\r\nin case his army should be molested while evacuating the town.\r\n\r\nIn 1776 Peter Johonnot went to Halifax and thence to England. In 1778 he\r\nwas proscribed and banished, and in 1779 he was a loyal Addresser to the\r\nKing. Mrs. Johonnot's death occurred in Boston in 1769. Mr. Johonnot\r\ndied in London August 8, 1809, at the age of eighty, and left no\r\nissue.[243] The following occurs in the Diary of Dr. P. Oliver:--\"1809,\r\nAug.--Peter Johonnot died this month in London, aged 79.\"\r\n\r\n  [243] New England Hist. and Gen. Reg. Vol. 7. P. 142.\r\n\r\nFRANCIS JOHONNOT, son of Daniel, was born November 30, 1709. He married\r\nMary Johnson of Boston, widow, 1752. He was a distiller and engaged in\r\nmercantile pursuits. His distillery was near Essex street on the margin\r\nof the South Cove. His \"Mansion house\" was on Newbury, now Washington\r\nstreet, the same was owned and occupied for many years by his\r\nson-in-law Eben Oliver, Esq. He was a loyalist, and at the beginning of\r\nthe revolution went to England. He died March 8, 1775. Mary, his widow,\r\nwho died in Boston March 17, 1797, in her seventy-third year,\r\nadministered upon his estate in Massachusetts. They had seven children.\r\n\r\nMARY JOHONNOT, daughter of Andrew Johonnot, and cousin to Peter the\r\nLoyalist, was born in 1730. She married Thomas Edwards of Boston, June\r\n13, 1758, the ceremony being performed by the Rev. Henry Caner of King's\r\nChapel. Mr. Edwards for a while was engaged in mercantile business in\r\nMiddletown, Connecticut, but later returned to Boston, and was employed\r\nby the government. He was a loyalist and went to Halifax in 1776 and\r\nthence to England. He died in London at an advanced age. Mary Johonnot,\r\nhis wife, died in Boston, February 14, 1792. They had five children.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF CONFISCATED ESTATES BELONGING TO PETER JOHONNOT IN SUFFOLK\r\n                      COUNTY AND TO WHOM SOLD.\r\n\r\n     To Ebenezer Seaver, Sept. 4, 1782; Lib. 135, fol. 190; Land and\r\n       buildings in Boston, Orange St. E.; Samuel Pope and Hopestill\r\n       Foster S.; Joseph Lovell and heirs of William Ettridge W.;\r\n       Zachariah Johonnot N.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 JOHN JOY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of Joy was probably derived from Jouy in Normandy and may have\r\nreached England in the form of \"de Jouy.\" William Joy was a Vicar in\r\nEngland in 1395. The name was borne with distinction in England and\r\nIreland for at least five centuries.\r\n\r\nThomas Joy, of Boston, Massachusetts, was born about 1610 in the county\r\nof Norfolk, England. The first time he appears in Boston records is \"on\r\nthe 20th of 12th Month, called February, 1636.\" By trade he was a\r\nbuilder and probably continued that occupation in Massachusetts. He\r\nmarried in 1637 Joan Gallop, the daughter of a well-known townsman, and\r\nshe became mother of the American Joys. Her father's land included\r\nseveral of the harbor islands, one of which still bears his name.\r\n\r\nThomas Joy built in 1657-8, the house in the Market Place, which was at\r\nonce the armory, court house, and town hall of Boston, and the first\r\nseat of government in Massachusetts. On account of political troubles,\r\nThomas Joy exchanged part of his possessions in Boston for property in\r\nHingham. In 1648 he removed to that town, but his Boston connections\r\nwere still maintained. He had interests in mills at Hingham, and died in\r\nthat town, October 21, 1678. His widow survived him more than twelve\r\nyears, dying in Hingham, March 20, 1690-1. Both are buried in the hill,\r\nback of most ancient Protestant church in the United States, where they\r\nworshipped. They had ten children.\r\n\r\nJoseph, the fourth child, was born in Boston, April 1, 1645. He lived on\r\nBacheler (Main Street,) Hingham, nearly opposite the meeting house, of\r\nwhich he is thought to have been the builder. He married August 29,\r\n1667, Mary, daughter of John and Margaret Prince, of Hingham, and by her\r\nhad fifteen children. He died in that town, May 31, 1697.\r\n\r\nJoseph Joy, his eldest son was born in Hingham July 30, 1688. He was\r\nconstable in 1697-1711. He married May 22, 1690 Elizabeth, daughter of\r\nCaptain Thomas Andrews. He died in Hingham, April 29, 1716. His\r\ngravestone with inscription still legible in the Hingham churchyard is\r\nthe most ancient Joy grave mark in America.[244] He had nine children.\r\n\r\n  [244] Thomas Joy and His Descendants by James R. Joy.\r\n\r\nJohn, the fourth child, was born in Hingham February 7, 1695-6. He lived\r\non Main street at Hingham Centre. December 7, 1724, he married Lydia,\r\ndaughter of Samuel Lincoln, and by her had seven children. His death is\r\nnot recorded.\r\n\r\nJOHN JOY, the second child of the preceding, was born in Hingham June 4,\r\n1727. He lived in Boston, and by trade was merchant and housewright. He\r\nmarried Sarah, daughter of Michael and Sarah (Kneeland) Homer, of\r\nBoston. In 1767 and 1773 he was one of the \"principal citizens\" to visit\r\nthe schools with the Governor. In 1774 Mr. Joy was an addresser of\r\nHutchinson, and in 1775 of Gage. In 1776 he went to Halifax with his\r\nfamily and in 1778 he was proscribed and banished. In 1779 he was in\r\nEngland, where he remained, though several of his sons afterwards\r\nreturned to America. Hutchinson in his diary, June 7, 1776, speaks of a\r\nnumber of Loyalists who had recently arrived at Dover. Mr. Joy's name\r\nwas among those mentioned. The Loyalist died in London, December, 1804.\r\nHis portrait by Copley, is an heirloom in the family of the late Charles\r\nJoy of Boston. Mrs. Joy died in England in 1805.\r\n\r\nA letter of John Wendell (1806) mentions among his early friends in\r\nBoston, \"Mr. John Joy, who served his time with our respected neighbor,\r\nCaptain Benjamin Russell, and who afterwards married Mr. Homer's\r\ndaughter.\" Mr. Joy had seven children.\r\n\r\nDR. JOHN JOY, the eldest son, was an apothecary, and returned to America\r\nin 1783, and lived in Boston. His estate on Beacon Hill, once the \"elm\r\npasture\" of Judge Samuel Sewell, the diarist, was bounded by Beacon,\r\nWalnut, Mt. Vernon and Joy street, and included about 100,000 sq. ft. of\r\nland. Bowditch says Dr. Joy was desirous of getting a house _in the\r\ncountry_, and selected this locality as \"being country enough for him,\"\r\n\"the barberry bushes were flourishing over this whole area.\" His land\r\ncost about $2000, and in 1833 his heirs sold this lot for $98,000. On\r\nthe southeastern part of this estate he built a modest and graceful\r\nwooden building, which was eventually moved to South Boston Point. He\r\nmarried Abigail Green of Boston, and died in 1813.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL JOY, another son, was born at Boston in 1754, went to England\r\nwith his father and died at Hartham Park, England July 10, 1825.\r\nGraduated B. A., Harvard College, 1771, and admitted to the same degree\r\nat Princeton College, N. J., 1771. He married a lady named Hall in\r\nEngland.

He returned to Boston,\r\nwas a merchant and was the first Consul General of the United States at\r\nCalcutta, holding his commission from President Washington. In 1808 he\r\nbought of the trustees of the First Church their property on Cornhill\r\nSquare, on which he erected Joy's Building, which for three-fourths of a\r\ncentury was a landmark of Boston, people came from miles around to view\r\nthe stately edifice, and were greatly astonished at its magnificence.\r\nThe Rogers Building, in front of Young's Hotel, now occupies its site.\r\nHe was one of the Mt. Vernon proprietors that acquired the valuable\r\nlands of John Singleton Copley on Beacon Hill, and a spring in one of\r\nhis houses on the east side of Charles street, is the famous spring of\r\nwater which William Blackstone, the first white settler of Boston,\r\nmentioned as one of the chief attractions of the Shawmut peninsula.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           RICHARD LECHMERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHon. Thomas Lechmere was for many years Surveyor General of His\r\nMajesty's Customs for the Northern District of America. His brother was\r\nLord Lechmere of Evesham, who married the daughter of the Earl of\r\nCarlisle.\r\n\r\nThomas Lechmere married Ann Winthrop, a descendant of Governor Winthrop,\r\nthe ceremony was performed by Rev. Eben Pemberton, Nov. 17, 1709. He\r\ndied at an advanced age, June 4th, 1765, having been born in June, 1683.\r\nHis wife died in 1746.\r\n\r\nRICHARD LECHMERE, son of the above, married Mary Phips, of Cambridge in\r\n1753. She was the daughter of Spencer Phips, who was Lieut. Governor for\r\nmany years; his farm was what is now known as East Cambridge, and the\r\nhouse stood near where the modern Court House, afterwards was built;\r\nGeneral Gage landed his detachment here, which marched to Lexington.\r\nAbout one hundred yards from the West Boston Bridge, a fort was erected\r\non December 11th, 1775, during its erection several soldiers of the\r\nrevolutionary army were killed at this redoubt. It was considered the\r\nstrongest battery erected during the siege of Boston, and was known as\r\n\"Lechmere Point Redoubt,\" having acquired this property from his wife.\r\nIt was known for many years as Lechmere's Point. The farm was\r\nconfiscated, and during the siege of Boston was occupied by Washington's\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nRichard Lechmere was an Addresser of Hutchinson in 1774; was appointed\r\nMandamus Councillor, but did not accept. In 1776 he went to Halifax,\r\nwith his family of eleven persons, and thence to England. In 1778 he was\r\nproscribed and banished, and his estate confiscated; the next year he\r\nwas included in the Conspiracy Act. His home was at Bristol in 1780. He\r\ndied in England in 1814, aged eighty-seven.\r\n\r\nRichard Lechmere left no male representatives, his daughters, are\r\nrepresented by Coores of Scrunten Hall, Yorkshire. Sir Edward Russell of\r\nAshford Hall, Ludlow and Worralls, whose representatives now are Sir H.\r\nLechmere Stuart, Bart., and Eyre Coote of West Park Eyre. In Colonel\r\nLechmere Russell's possession is Ann Winthrop's bible, with, in her son\r\nRichard Lechmere's writing, the statement it was his mother's bible. A\r\npiece of land at Hanley, in Worcestershire, the residence of the\r\nLechmere's, is called New England, and is planted with oaks, the seed of\r\nwhich were sent from America by Thomas Lechmere, the settler here.\r\n\r\nNicholas Lechmere, son of Thomas Lechmere, and brother of Richard, was\r\nborn at Boston, July 29, 1772. He was appointed an Officer of the\r\nCustoms of Newport, Rhode Island. In 1765, fearing the loss of life in\r\nthe tumult of that year, he fled to the Cygnet, sloop-of-war, and\r\nrefused to return to his duties without assurance of protection. From\r\n1767 to the commencement of the Revolution, the disagreements between\r\nhim and the revolutionists were frequent. In December, 1775, he refused\r\nto take the oath tendered by General Lee, and was conveyed under guard\r\nto Providence. He went to England, and in 1770, was with his brother at\r\nBristol in 1780. He was banished and his estate confiscated.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF CONFISCATED ESTATES BELONGING TO RICHARD LECHMERE IN SUFFOLK\r\n                          COUNTY AND TO WHOM SOLD.\r\n\r\n     To Mungo Mackey, June 11, 1783; Lib. 139, fol. 14; Land and\r\n       dwelling-house in Boston, Cambridge St. S.; Staniford St. W.;\r\n       passageway N.; Timothy Newell E. and N.; Jeremiah Allen E.----One\r\n       undivided half of land, brick distill house and other buildings,\r\n       Cambridge St. N.; George St. E.; heirs of John Guttridge deceased\r\n       S.; Belknap St. W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               EZEKIEL LEWIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Lewis belonged to the Braintree Company, which in 1632 removed\r\nfrom Braintree to Cambridge, thence about 1636 to Hartford, about 1659\r\nto Hadley, which town he represented in the General Court 1662, from\r\nthence to Farmington, where he died Aug., 1683. Captain William Lewis,\r\nson of the above, married May Cheever, daughter of the famous\r\nschoolmaster. He died 18 Aug., 1690. Ezekiel Lewis, son of Captain\r\nWilliam, was born at Farmington, Conn., Nov. 7, 1674. Graduated at\r\nHarvard College in 1695. In 1699 it was decided that the town of Boston\r\nrequired an assistant in the Latin School for Mr. Ezekiel Cheever. It\r\nbeing committed to the Selectmen, Mr. Ezekiel Lewis, his grandson, was\r\nselected to fill the position, and to have a salary of not exceeding\r\nforty pounds a year. He entered upon his duties the following August. He\r\nafterwards became a great merchant in Boston, was Representative 1723 to\r\n1727.\r\n\r\nA document dated March 8th, 1707-8 contains the signatures of the\r\nOverseers of the Poor for the town of Boston at that period. Ezekiel\r\nLewis' name appears among the seven mentioned.

WILLIAM CLARK, ESQ. became a wealthy merchant and member of the\r\nGovernor's Council. His residence was situated in North Square, on the\r\ncorner of Garden Court and Prince street. This mansion was a monument of\r\nhuman pride, in all colonial Boston there was not its peer, and it was\r\nwithout doubt built to outvie that of Hutchinson's, Clark's wealthy\r\nnext-door neighbor, whose home was demolished by the mob. The principal\r\nfeature which distinguished this house, was the rich, elaborate and\r\npeculiar decoration of the north parlor, on the right of the entrance\r\nhall, which was a rich example of the prevalent style, found in the\r\nmansions of wealthy citizens of the colonial period, in and around\r\nBoston.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar decoration consisted of a series of raised panels filling\r\nthese compartments, reaching from the surbase to the frieze, eleven in\r\nall, each embellished with a romantic landscape painted in oil colors,\r\nthe four panels opposite the windows being further enriched by the\r\nemblazoned escutcheons of the Clarks, the Saltonstalls, and other allied\r\nfamilies. Beneath the surbase, the panels, as also those of the door,\r\nwere covered with arabesques. The twelfth painting was a view of the\r\nhouse upon a horizontal panel over the mantel, from which this engraving\r\nwas made, and beneath this panel inscribed in an oval, was the monogram\r\nof the builder, W. C. At the base of the gilded and fluted vault of the\r\nbuffet was a painted dove. The floor was inlaid with divers woods in\r\nmultiform patterns. In the center, surrounded by a border, emblazoned in\r\nproper colors, was the escutcheon of the Clarks, with its three white\r\nswans.\r\n\r\nThe mere enumeration of the details fails to give an idea of the\r\nimpression made by this painted and gilded parlor, not an inch of whose\r\nsurface but had been elaborated by painter, gilder, carver or artist, to\r\nwhich the blazoner had added heraldic emblems; so that, as you looked\r\nround these walls, the romantic ruins and castles seemed placed there to\r\nsuggest, if not to portray, the old homes of a long line of ancestors,\r\nand the escutcheons above to confirm the suggestion, thereby enhancing\r\nthe splendor of the present by the feudal dignity of an august past.\r\n\r\nThe house is supposed to have been built about 1712-1715, for the land\r\nwas purchased of Ann Hobby, widow, and several other heirs, December 10,\r\n1711, for L725 current money. If so, Councillor Clark lived many years\r\nto enjoy the sumptuousness of his new house and the envy of his\r\nneighbors. His death, in 1742, was attributed by some to the loss of\r\nforty sail of vessels in the French war. After his death the estate was\r\nconveyed to his son-in-law, Deacon Thomas Greenough, for L1,400, old\r\ntenor, and was by him sold to Sir Charles Henry Frankland, Bart., for\r\nL1,200 sterling. The mansion, afterwards was known as the Frankland\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nThere were numerous places in Boston named after Clark. There was\r\nClark's Wharf, afterwards changed to Hancock's, and now known as Lewis;\r\nClark street from Hanover to Commercial, still named, in 1788; Clark\r\nSquare, now North Square, where the Clark mansion was built, was named\r\nin 1708, \"The Square living on ye Southly side of the North Meeting\r\nHouse including ye wayes on each side of ye watch-house\"; Clark's\r\nCorner, 1708, corner of Middle, now Hanover street and Bennet street,\r\nDr. Clark's Corner, 1732; corner of Fish, now North street, and Gallops\r\nalley, now Board alley and Clark's Shipyard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLARK-FRANKLAND HOUSE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      AGNES, LADY FRANKLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Harry Frankland, as he was familiarly called here, was heir to an\r\nample fortune, and what added to his interest in this puritanical colony\r\nwas that he was a descendant in the fourth generation from Oliver\r\nCromwell, he came here in 1741 as Collector of the Port of Boston,\r\npreferring that office to the Governorship of Massachusetts, the\r\nalternative offered him by George II. The story of his marriage is\r\nromantic enough. Upon an official visit to Marblehead, he was struck by\r\nthe radiant beauty of a young girl of sixteen, maid-of-all-work at the\r\nvillage inn, bare-legged, scrubbing the floor; inquired her name, and,\r\nupon a subsequent visit, with the consent of her parents, conveyed her\r\nto Boston and placed her at the best school. The attachment he conceived\r\nfor her appears to have been returned, though Sir Charles did not offer\r\nher marriage. The connection between this high official and his fair\r\nprotege causing scandal, Frankland purchased some 500 acres of land in\r\nHopkinton, which he laid out and cultivated with taste, built a stately\r\ncountry-house and extensive farm buildings, and there entertained all\r\nthe gay companions he could collect with deer and fox hunts without,\r\nwith music and feasting within doors, duly attending the church of his\r\nneighbor, the Rev. Roger Price, late of King's Chapel, Boston, of which\r\nFrankland had been, from his arrival, a member. Called to England by the\r\ndeath of his uncle, whose title he inherited as fourth baronet, he\r\njourneyed to Lisbon, and there, upon All Saints Day, 1755, on his way to\r\nhigh mass, he was engulfed by the earthquake, his horses killed, and he\r\nwould have perished miserably but for his discovery and rescue by the\r\ndevoted Agnes. Grateful and penitent, he led her to the altar, and poor\r\nAgnes Surriage, the barefooted maid-of-all-work of the inn at\r\nMarblehead, was translated into Agnes, Lady Frankland.\r\n\r\nIt was upon Sir Harry Frankland's return from Europe in 1756 that he\r\nbecame the owner of the Clark House, lived in it one short year,\r\nentertaining continually, with the assistance of his French cook,\r\nThomas, as appears by frequent entries in his journal; was then\r\ntransferred to Lisbon as Consul General, and so, with the exception of\r\nbrief visits to this country in 1759 and 1763, disappearing from our\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nAfter his death at Bath, England, in 1768, his widow returned here with\r\nher son, but not until she had recorded her husband's virtues upon a\r\nmonument \"erected by his affectionate widow, Agnes, Lady\r\nFrankland,\"--dividing her year between Boston and Hopkinton, exchanging\r\ncivilities with those who had once rejected her, till the contest with\r\nEngland rendered all loyalists and officials unpopular.\r\n\r\nAt Hopkinton, May, 1775, she was alarmed at the movement of the\r\nrevolutionists, her Ladyship asked leave to remove to Boston. The\r\nCommittee of Safety gave her liberty to pass to the capital with her\r\npersonal effects, and gave her a written permit, signed by Benjamin\r\nChurch. Jr., chairman. Thus protected, she set out on her journey with\r\nher attendants; but was arrested by a party of armed men, who detained\r\nher person, and effects, until an order for the release of both was\r\nobtained. To prevent further annoyance, the Provincial Congress\r\nfurnished her with an escort, and required all persons who had any of\r\nher property in their possession to place the same at her disposal.\r\nDefended by a guard of six soldiers, Lady Frankland entered Boston about\r\nthe first of June, 1775; witnessed from her window in Garden Court\r\nstreet the battle of Bunker Hill, took her part in relieving the\r\nsufferings of the wounded officers, and then in her turn disappeared,\r\nleaving her estates in the hands of members of her family, thereby\r\nsaving them from confiscation, which was the fate of her neighbor\r\nHutchinson. Upon her death in England in 1782 the town mansion passed by\r\nher will to her family, and was sold by Isaac Surriage in 1811 for $8000\r\nto Mr. Joshua Ellis, a retired North End merchant, who resided there\r\ntill his death. Upon the widening of Bell Alley, in 1832, these two\r\nproud mansions, the Frankland and Hutchinson houses long since deserted\r\nby the families whose importance they were erected to illustrate and\r\nperpetuate, objects of interest to the poet, the artist, and the\r\nhistorian, alike for their associations with a seemingly remote past,\r\ntheir antique splendor, and for the series of strange romantic incidents\r\nin the lives of their successive occupants, were ruthlessly swept away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         COLONEL DAVID PHIPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most picturesque and remarkable in character and personal fortune of\r\nall the royal governors, was the first of them, Sir William Phips. He\r\nwas a characteristic product of the New England soil, times and ways.\r\nHutchinson thus briefly and fitly designates him: \"He was an honest man,\r\nbut by a series of fortunate incidents, rather than by any uncommon\r\ntalents, he rose from the lowest condition in life to be the first man\r\nin the country.\"\r\n\r\nCotton Mather informs us that William Phips was one of twenty-one _sons_\r\nand of _twenty-six_ children, of the same mother, born to James Phips of\r\nBristol, England, a blacksmith, and gunsmith, who was an early settler\r\nin the woods of Maine, at the mouth of the Kennebec River. But records\r\nand history are dumb as to facts about the most of these scions of a\r\nfruitful parentage, other than that of their having been born. William\r\nwas born Feb. 2, 1651; was left in early childhood without a father.\r\nWhat the mother's task was, in poverty, with hard wilderness\r\nsurroundings, of bears, wolves, and savages, we may well imagine. Her\r\nfamous son, untaught and ignorant, tended sheep, till he was eighteen\r\nyears of age. Then he helped to build coasters, and sailed in them. This\r\nwas at that time, and afterwards a most thriving business, the\r\nfoundation of fortunes to rugged and enterprising men, born in\r\nindigence.\r\n\r\nHe went to Boston in 1673, at the age of twenty-two, worked at his\r\ntrade, he had early visions of success and greatness, for the first time\r\nhe learned to read, and also to do something that passed for writing. He\r\nmarried the widow of John Hull, the mint master, they suffered straits\r\ntogether, but he used to comfort her with the assurance that they would\r\nyet have \"a fair brick house in the Green Lane of North Boston.\" And so\r\nthey did. That \"Greene Lane\" became Charter street, when in 1692, he\r\ncame back as Sir William Phips, from the Court of London, bringing the\r\nProvince Charter as the first Governor under it. The \"fair brick house\"\r\nlong served as an Asylum for boys, at the corner of Salem and Charles\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nBut a strange wild daring, and romantic interval of adventure preceded\r\nhis honors, and wealth. He wrought at intervals in Maine, and here, as a\r\nship carpenter, sailed coasters, and engaged in expeditions against the\r\nIndians. In 1684 he went in a search in the waters of the Spanish Main\r\nfor a treasure ship known to be sunk there. Going to London, the\r\nAdmiralty, and James II. gave him the command of an eighteen-gun ship\r\nand ninety-five men. A two years' cruise in the West Indies, in which he\r\nshowed a most signal intrepidity, heroism and ingenuity of resource, in\r\nsuppressing a mutinous crew, was unsuccessful, except in acquainting\r\nhim, through an old Spaniard, of the precise spot where a treasure-laden\r\ngalleon had foundered fifty years before. He returned to England for a\r\nnew outfit. The king favored him, but not with another war ship. The\r\nDuke of Albemarle and others, as associates, provided him with a vessel\r\non shares. The hero had heroic success. Cotton Mather informs us that\r\n\"Captain Phips arrived at _Port de la Plata_, made a stout _canoo_ of a\r\nstately cotton-tree, employing his own _hands_ and _adse_ in\r\nconstructing it, lying abroad in the woods many nights together. The\r\npiriaga, as they called it, discovered a reef of rising shoals called\r\n\"_The Boilers_\", here an Indian diver dove down and perceived a number\r\nof _great-guns_, and upon further diving the Indian fetched up a _sow_,\r\nor lump of silver, worth two or three hundred pounds. In all, thirty-two\r\ntons of silver, gold, pearls and jewels were recovered from the wreck.\r\nBesides which, one Adderly of Providence, one of the Bahama Islands,\r\ntook up about six tons of silver, which he took to the Bermudas. Captain\r\nPhips returned to London in 1687 with more than a million and a half of\r\ndollars, in gold and silver, diamonds, precious stones, and other\r\ntreasures. His own share in the proceeds was about a hundred thousand\r\ndollars. To this was added the honors of knighthood, and a gold cup for\r\nLady Phips, of the value of five thousand dollars.\"\r\n\r\nHe returned home in the capacity of high-sheriff, under Andros, who did\r\nnot want him, for he was utterly ignorant of law, and could not write\r\nlegibly. He soon made another voyage to England, and returned to Boston,\r\nbuilt the \"fair brick house,\" of his vision, engaged in a successful\r\nmilitary expedition against Acadia, in which he took and plundered Port\r\nRoyal, and other French settlements. He then instigated and conducted\r\nas commander, a naval expedition against Quebec, which proved a failure.\r\nHe again went to England, and returned as the first Governor under the\r\nnew Charter, May 14, 1692. The appointment was made to conciliate the\r\npeople of the province, and it was supposed would be gratifying to them,\r\nit was however a risky experiment, this attempt to initiate a new order\r\nof things, under the lead of an illiterate mechanic, utterly unskilled,\r\nin legal, and administrative affairs, a rough seaman, and a man of hot\r\ntemper. Yet after he arose to these high offices, he showed no false\r\npride, and often alluded to his lowly origin. He gave his fellow ship\r\ncarpenters a dinner in Boston, and when borne down with public\r\ndistraction, would wish himself back to his broad-axe again. He was pure\r\nin morals, upright in his dealings, and owed his success in life to his\r\nown energy and prowess. All incompetent as he was for the stern\r\nexigency, he had to meet the appalling outburst of the Witchcraft\r\ndelusion with its spell of horrors. During the greater part of the\r\nproceedings of the courts, he was absent at the eastward, in an\r\nexpedition against the Indians, and engaged in building a fort at\r\nPemaquid. When he returned to Boston he found that even his own wife had\r\nbeen \"cried out upon\" as a witch, and he at once put a stay upon the\r\nfatuous proceedings. His weak and troubled administration lasted two and\r\none-half years. He then went to England to answer to complaints made\r\nagainst his administration, when he died suddenly Feb. 18, 1695, aged\r\nforty-five years. He was buried in the church of St. Mary Woolnoth,\r\nLondon, where his widow caused a monument to be erected to his memory.\r\nHe died childless.\r\n\r\nGovernor Phips' widow married the rich merchant, Peter Sergent, who\r\nbuilt and occupied the stately mansion, afterwards purchased by the\r\nProvince, as a residence for the Governor, and known as the Province\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nSPENCER PHIPS was a nephew of Governor Phips' wife. The governor having\r\nno children, adopted as his heir, Spencer Bennett, he was Lieu. Governor\r\nbetween 1733 and 1757, and married Elizabeth Hutchinson. He resided\r\nmainly at Cambridge. His farm consisted of that part of Cambridge\r\nafterwards known as Lechmere Point, now East Cambridge, his daughters\r\nmarried Andrew Boardman, John Vassall, Richard Lechmere and Joseph Lee.\r\nLieu. Governor Phips died in March, 1757.\r\n\r\nDAVID PHIPS, only son of Lieutenant Governor Spencer Phips, graduated at\r\nHarvard College in 1741. He was Colonel of a troop of guards in Boston,\r\nand Sheriff of Middlesex County. He was an Addresser on three occasions,\r\nas his name is found among the one hundred and twenty-four merchants,\r\nand others, of Boston, who addressed Governor Hutchinson in 1774, among\r\nthe ninety-seven gentlemen and principal inhabitants of that town, and\r\namong the eighteen country gentlemen who were driven from their homes,\r\nand who addressed General Gage in October, 1775. He went to Halifax at\r\nthe evacuation of Boston in 1776, and was proscribed and banished under\r\nthe Act of 1778. His home at Cambridge was confiscated. He died at Bath,\r\nEngland in 1811, aged eighty-seven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE DUNBAR FAMILY OF HINGHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert Dunbar, a Scotchman, became a resident of Hingham shortly after\r\n1650, and probably was the ancestor of all the families who have borne\r\nthis surname in Plymouth county. The Christian name of his wife was\r\nRose. She survived him and died 10 Nov. 1700. Robert died, 19 Sept.,\r\n1693. He had eight sons and three daughters, and died possessed of\r\nconsiderable property. His grandson Joseph removed to Halifax, Plymouth\r\nCounty, in 1736.[246]\r\n\r\n  [246] Hist. of Hingham. Vol. 11. P. 195-7-9.\r\n\r\nDANIEL DUNBAR, son of the aforesaid Joseph was born in Hingham, March 8,\r\n1733. He was an ensign of Militia at Halifax, Mass., and in 1774 had his\r\ncolors demanded of him by the mob, some of the selectmen being the chief\r\nactors. He refused and they broke into his house, took him out, forced\r\nhim upon a rail, where for three hours, he was held, and tossed, up and\r\ndown, until he was exhausted. He was then dragged and beaten, and gave\r\nup the standard to save his life. In 1776 he went to Halifax, Nova\r\nScotia, with the Royal Army. In 1778 he was proscribed and banished.\r\n\r\nJESSIE DUNBAR, of the fourth generation, was born in Hingham, June 26,\r\n1744. He removed to Bridgewater, Plymouth County.[247]\r\n\r\n  [247] Dunbar Genealogy. P. 19.\r\n\r\nHe bought some fat cattle of Nathaniel Ray Thomas, a Mandamus\r\nCouncillor, in 1774, and drove them to Plymouth for sale; one of the\r\noxen being skinned and hung up, the \"Sons of Liberty\" came to him and\r\nfinding where he bought it, commenced punishing him for the offence. His\r\ntormentors put the ox in a cart, and fixing Dunbar in his belly, carted\r\nhim four miles and required him to pay one dollar for the ride. They\r\nthen delivered him to a Kingston mob, which carted him four miles\r\nfurther, and forced from him another dollar, then delivered him to a\r\nDuxbury mob, who abused him by beating him in the face with the\r\ncreature's tripe, and endeavored to cover his person with it, to the\r\nendangering his life. They then threw dirt at him, and after other\r\nabuses, carried him to Councillor Thomas's house, and made him pay\r\nanother sum of money, and he, not taking the beef, they flung it in the\r\nroad and quitted him. Jesse Dunbar died at Nobleboro, Maine, in 1806,\r\nleaving many descendants.\r\n\r\nThe outrageous and brutal treatment he received from the \"Sons of\r\nDespotism\" are among the worst on record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      EBENEZER RICHARDSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Richardson family were the earliest settlers of Woburn,\r\nMassachusetts. Ezekiel, Samuel and Thomas Richardson, three brothers,\r\nwith four other persons, laid the foundations of the town, in 1641. In\r\n1642 it was incorporated under the name of Woburn, the name of a town in\r\nHerefordshire.\r\n\r\nSamuel Richardson, the ancestor of Ebenezer Richardson, came to\r\nCharlestown, about 1636, as his name appears on the records of July 1 of\r\nthat date as one of a committee to \"lay out lots of land for hay.\" When\r\nthe three brothers settled at Woburn, they lived near each other on the\r\nsame street, which was laid out in 1647, as Richardson's Row, by which\r\nname it has ever since been known. It runs almost due north and south,\r\nin the N. E. part of the present town of Winchester.\r\n\r\nLieut. John Richardson, eldest son of Samuel, was born Nov. 12, 1639,\r\nwas a yeoman, and soldier in King Philip's war, and passed his life in\r\nWoburn, and died there in 1696. John Richardson, son of Lieut. John was\r\na carpenter, and lived in Woburn. He died March 18, 1715.\r\n\r\nTimothy Richardson, son of John, was born in Woburn, 1687, was badly\r\nwounded in Lovewell's Indian fight at Pigwacket. The colony having\r\noffered one hundred pounds for Indian scalps, Captain Lovewell went with\r\nforty-six men on a scalp hunt into Maine. Captain Lovewell was the first\r\none killed. The fight lasted ten hours, those who left the fatal battle\r\nground, were twenty in number, of whom eleven were badly wounded, among\r\nwhom was Timothy Richardson, who lived for ten years afterwards, but in\r\ngreat suffering he died in Woburn in 1735.\r\n\r\nEBENEZER RICHARDSON, eldest son of Timothy, and Abigail Johnson, was\r\nborn in Woburn, March 31, 1718, and married Rebecca (Fowle) Richardson,\r\ndaughter of Captain John and Elizabeth (Prescott) Fowle, of Woburn, and\r\nwidow of Phineas Richardson. His father's farm was bounded easterly by\r\nthe Woburn and Stoneham line, it was here probably that Ebenezer was\r\nborn.[248]\r\n\r\n  [248] Richardson Memorial by Vinton. P. 34, 199, 242.\r\n\r\nEbenezer Richardson was an officer of the Customs in Boston. On the 22\r\nFeb., 1770, he was assailed by a mob who chased him to his home, bricks\r\nand stones were thrown at the windows. Richardson, provoked, fired at\r\nrandom into the mob, dangerously wounding one of them, Samuel Gore, and\r\nmortally wounding another, Christopher Snider, a poor German boy, who\r\ndied the next morning.\r\n\r\nThe excitement was intense, the funeral of the boy was attended by the\r\nrevolutionists, and the event taken advantage of to fire the passions of\r\nthe people. On the 20th of April, Richardson was tried for his life and\r\nbrought in guilty of murder. Chief Justice Hutchinson viewed the guilt\r\nof Richardson, as everybody would now, a clear case of justifiable\r\nhomicide, and consequently refused to sign a warrant for his execution,\r\nand after lying in prison two years, was, on application to the King,\r\npardoned and set at liberty.[249] To reward Richardson for what he had\r\nsuffered, he was appointed in 1773 as an officer of the Customs of\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\n  [249] For further particulars see pages 310, 311.\r\n\r\nHistorians have treated Richardson very unfairly, and caused his memory\r\nto be execrated. He was a Custom House officer, and the duties of his\r\noffice caused him to seize smuggled goods, as any custom house officer\r\nwould at the present time, previous to that he belonged to the secret\r\nservice division for the detection of illicit traders, on this account\r\nhe has always been contemptuously called an \"informer\". He was not any\r\nworse than hundreds of secret service agents employed at the present\r\ntime by the United States Government, to detect law-breakers. They are\r\nof course detested by the criminal classes, and the mountaineer\r\nmoonshiners of Kentucky consider it no crime to kill them, when the\r\nopportunity offers. After Richardson's release, he went to Philadelphia\r\nto reside, so as to escape mob violence; the malignity of the\r\nrevolutionists, however, followed him, and a scurrilous effusion was\r\npublished there entitled \"The Life and Humble Confession of Richardson\r\nthe Informer.\"\r\n\r\nThe broadside was embellished with a rude wood cut of Richardson firing\r\ninto the mob, and the killing of the boy Snider. The same has been\r\nrecently republished, and the author states \"Whatever facts it may\r\ncontain, are doubtless expanded beyond the limits of the actual\r\ntruth.\"[250]\r\n\r\n  [250] William R. Cutter, Librarian of the Woburn Public Library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     COMMODORE JOSHUA LORING.[251]\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Loring came from Axminster in Devonshire, England, to Dorchester\r\nwith his wife, Jane, whose maiden name was Newton, in the year 1634,\r\nthey removed to Hingham, and finally settled and died at Hull in 1661,\r\nleaving many descendants, who still reside in Hull, and Hingham.\r\n\r\n  [251] Ancestral Records of the Loring family. Type Written Copy in the\r\n  New England Historic Genealogical Society. Pp. 129 to 182.\r\n\r\nCOMMODORE JOSHUA LORING was descended from Thomas Loring. He was born at\r\nBoston, Aug. 3, 1716. He was apprenticed to Mr. Mears, a tanner of\r\nRoxbury. When he was of age he went to sea. About 1740 he married Mary,\r\ndaughter of Samuel Curtice, of Roxbury. In 1744 he was master of a\r\nBrigantine Privateer of Boston, and while cruising near Louisburg, was\r\ntaken by two French Men of War.\r\n\r\nHe purchased an estate in 1752, on Jamaica Plain, Roxbury, of Joshua\r\nCheever, on which he erected what has since been known as the Greenough\r\nmansion. It is said to have been framed in England and was one of the\r\nfinest residences in Roxbury. It was situated opposite the intersection\r\nof Center and South streets, opposite the soldiers' monument.\r\n\r\nOn December 19, 1757, He was commissioned captain in the British Navy,\r\nwas Commodore of the naval forces on Lakes Champlain and Ontario, and\r\nparticipated in the capture of Quebec under Wolfe, and in the conquest\r\nof Canada in the succeeding campaign of Amherst. He was severely wounded\r\nin the leg while in command on Lake Ontario, and at the close of the war\r\nhe retired on half pay, at which time he settled down at Jamaica Plain,\r\nRoxbury. He was one of the five Commissioners of the revenue, and\r\nGeneral Gage by writ of mandamus appointed him a member of his Council,\r\nand he was sworn in Aug. 17, 1774. This immediately subjected him to the\r\nstrictest surveillance by the revolutionists, and the greatest pressure\r\nwas brought to bear upon him to throw up the obnoxious office. A\r\ndiarist, under date of Aug. 29, speaking of a Roxbury town meeting\r\nrecently held says, \"Late in the evening a member visited Commodore\r\nLoring, and in a friendly way advised him to follow the example of his\r\ntownman Isaac Winslow, (who had already resigned). He desired time to\r\nconsider it. They granted it, but acquainted him if he did not comply he\r\nmust expect to be waited on by a large number, actuated by a different\r\nspirit. (Tarred and feathered and rode on a rail). On the morning of the\r\nLexington battle, after passing most of the previous night in\r\nconsultation with Deacon Joseph Brewer, his neighbor and intimate\r\nfriend, upon the step he was about to take, he mounted his horse, left\r\nhis home and everything belonging to it, never to return again, and\r\npistol in hand, rode at full speed to Boston, stopping on the way only\r\nto answer an old friend, who asked 'Are you going, Commodore?' 'Yes,' he\r\nreplied. 'I have always eaten the king's bread, and always intend to.'\"\r\nThe sacrifice must have been especially painful to him, for he was held\r\nin high esteem by his friends and neighbors, but he could not spurn the\r\nhand that had fed him, and rather than do a dishonorable act, he would\r\nsacrifice all he possessed, even the land of his birth. At the\r\nevacuation he went to England. He received a pension from the crown\r\nuntil his decease at Highgate, in October, 1781, at the age of\r\nsixty-five. Joshua Loring was proscribed, banished and his large estate\r\nconfiscated. His mansion house was in May, 1775, headquarters of General\r\nNathaniel Greene, and afterwards for a brief period, a hospital for\r\nAmerican soldiers, many of whom were buried on the adjacent grounds.\r\nLater Captain Isaac Sears bought the property of the State, and lived\r\nthere for several years.\r\n\r\nMary, his widow, was through the influence of Lord North, pensioned for\r\nlife; she settled at Englesfield, Berkshire County, England, where she\r\ndied in 1789 at the age of eighty.\r\n\r\nJOSHUA LORING, JR. was a twin brother of Benjamin Loring, sons of\r\nCommodore Loring. He was born Nov., 1744. He was an Addresser of\r\nGovernor Hutchinson in 1774, and of Gen. Gage in 1775. One of the last\r\nofficial acts of the latter in Boston was his proclamation of June 7,\r\n1775, appointing Mr. Loring \"sole vendue-master and auctioneer.\" He was\r\nHigh Sheriff and a member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery\r\nCompany in 1769. In 1776 he went to Halifax with the Royal Army, and,\r\nearly the next year, he was appointed Commissary of Prisoners by Sir\r\nWilliam Howe. He was severely criticized at the time by the\r\nRevolutionists, for cruelties to his unfortunate countrymen who were\r\nprisoners, but as Sabine truly says, \"it is not easy to ascertain the\r\ntruth or to determine his personal responsibility in the treatment of\r\nprisoners.\"[252] He was proscribed and banished, and died in England in\r\n1789, aged forty-five. His wife was a Miss Lloyd, to whom he was married\r\nat the house of Colonel Hatch in Dorchester in 1769. His son,\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN WENTWORTH LORING was born in Roxbury, Oct., 1773; was baptized\r\nin Trinity church by Rev. D. Walters, Nov. 29; was a midshipman in the\r\nBritish navy, and from 1819 to 1837 was Lieut. Governor of the Royal\r\nNaval College. In 1841 was advanced to the rank of Rear Admiral of the\r\nRed and in 1847 was promoted Vice Admiral of the White. His son,\r\nWilliam, was Captain of the \"Scout\" in the Royal Navy.\r\n\r\n  [252] A similar case occurred during the Civil War, there was probably\r\n  no man whose memory was more execrated, and who was regarded as a\r\n  monster than Wirz, the Commander at Andersonville, who was hanged by the\r\n  U. S. Government, and yet forty-five years afterwards the Daughters of\r\n  the Confederacy have erected a beautiful monument to his memory at\r\n  Andersonville.\r\n\r\nDR. BENJAMIN LORING, twin brother of Joshua Loring, Jr., born in 1744,\r\ngraduated at Harvard College in 1772. He was a Surgeon in a Regiment in\r\nthe King's service in South Carolina. At the peace, accompanied by his\r\nfamily of five persons, and by one servant, he went from New York to\r\nShelburne, Nova Scotia. His losses in consequences of his loyalty were\r\nestimated at $15,000. He was an absentee but not proscribed. He returned\r\nto Boston and died there in 1798, aged sixty-five.\r\n\r\nCOMMODORE JOHN LORING, son of Commodore Joshua, was a midshipman in the\r\nRoyal Navy, at fourteen years of age. In 1776 he was one of four\r\nprisoners taken in the schooner Valent, and sent into Boston, as there\r\nwas no place provided for prisoners he was sent to Concord Jail by the\r\nCouncil, who ordered \"that Edward Marsh, and John Loring should not use\r\npen or paper, nor any one allowed to speak to them, but in the presence\r\nof the jailor\". His uncle Obediah Curtis being a very influential man,\r\ninterceded for him so strenuously, he being but quite a youth, that he\r\nwas released and sent to the care of Col. Buckminster of Framingham, his\r\nwife's father. His kind host was in danger of having his home demolished\r\nfor harboring a \"young Tory\", on account of the young man calling his\r\nneighbors \"rascally rebels.\" In 1776 he was exchanged and returned to\r\nEngland. He was early a Post Captain. In 1793 he had command of the\r\nBritish Squadron in the Camatic. In 1803 he had command of the Frigate\r\nBellerophon (which in 1813 conveyed Napoleon to St. Helena) and captured\r\nthe French Frigate Duquesne, 74 guns, and a national schooner. In the\r\nsame year he was Commodore of the British Fleet off Cape Francoix,\r\nwhich blockaded and defeated the French squadron, and the troops under\r\nRochambeau, Nov. 30, 1803. Commodore John Loring died at his seat in\r\nFarehan, Nov. 9, 1808, leaving a widow and children. The Naval service\r\nlost in him \"one of its most brave, zealous and humane officers.\" He\r\nmarried Miss Macneal of Campleton Argyleshire, a lady of great beauty.\r\nHis son Hector, became captain of the Howe, 120 guns, of the Royal Navy.\r\nHe married Miss Charlotte Jessy, daughter of James Jamison of the Royal\r\nBengal Medical Service. His eldest son John, a midshipman on board of\r\nthe Eurylas, in 1820, died of the yellow fever at Bermuda.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH ROYAL LORING, son of Commodore Joshua, probably never married. He\r\nwas captain of the Brigantine \"William,\" owned by Richard Clarke and\r\nSons, of Boston, engaged in bringing tea from London to Boston. It was\r\nthe fourth and last vessel on the East India Company's account to sail\r\nthere. She was cast ashore at Provincetown on Cape Cod. The tea was\r\nsaved and conveyed to the Castle in Boston Harbor. Very little is known\r\nafterwards of Captain Royal Loring.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LIST OF CONFISCATED ESTATES BELONGING TO JOSHUA LORING IN SUFFOLK COUNTY\r\n                                  AND TO WHOM SOLD.\r\n\r\n     To John Keyes, Aug. 31, 1779; Lib. 130, fol. 191; Land 19 A.,\r\n       mansion house and barn in Roxbury, Joshua Loring N. and N.E.;\r\n       Lemuel May E.; Ebenezer Weld S.; road leading to Dedham W.; then\r\n       running S.; E. and N. on land of John Keyes.\r\n\r\n     To Isaac Sears, Oct. 28, 1779; Lib. 130, fol. 237; Farm, 54 A. 3\r\n       qr. 9 r., and mansion house in Roxbury, road leading by Jamaica\r\n       meeting-house to Boston W.; heirs of Mr. Burroughs deceased N. and\r\n       N.W.; lane N.E.; lane and Capt.

The earliest ancestor of whom anything is known with\r\ncertainty is\r\n\r\nI. Adam Winthrop, known to have been living at Lavenham, in Suffolk in\r\n1498, who had, by his wife Jane Burton, a son--\r\n\r\nII. Adam Winthrop second of that name, born in Lavenham, Oct. 9, 1498,\r\ndied in Groton, Nov. 9, 1562, who became a wealthy London merchant,\r\nacquired the manor of Groton, near Lavenham, in 1544; was inscribed\r\nArmiger by Edward VI. in 1548, and in 1551 was Master of the influential\r\nCompany of Clothworkers. He had thirteen children, several of whom\r\nbecame distinguished. His third son was--\r\n\r\nIII. Adam Winthrop, third of that name, who came into possession of\r\nGroton Manor. He was born in London, Aug. 10th, 1548, died at Groton\r\nMarch 28, 1623. He was a lawyer and county magistrate, and married\r\nAlice, sister of Dr. John Still, Bishop of Bath and Wells. His only son\r\nwas--\r\n\r\nIV. John Winthrop, born Jan. 12, and died in Boston, March 26, 1649. He\r\nwas a lawyer and magistrate, and became a great Puritan leader, and led\r\nthe greatest emigration that had ever gone forth from England up to this\r\ntime. In February, 1630, preparations began to be made with vigor for\r\nthe embarkation of a great colony, by the end of the month a fleet of\r\nfourteen vessels was ready with men, women and children, and all\r\nnecessary men of handicrafts, and others of good condition, wealth, and\r\nquality, to make a firm plantation. In this fleet were congregated the\r\nforefathers of Massachusetts, with their wives and little ones, about to\r\nquit forever their native country, kindred, friends, and acquaintances.\r\nThey were to leave the land of their fathers, perhaps forever, to break\r\nassunder those chords of affection, which so powerfully bind a good man\r\nto his native soil, and to dissolve those tender associations which\r\nconstitute the bliss of civil society, and to seek in an unknown\r\nwilderness, a new home, which in time would become a great nation. On\r\nthe 8th of June, 1630, the fleet sighted land, Mt. Desert, and regaled\r\nthemselves with fish of their own catching. \"So pleasant a scene here\r\nthey had, as did much refresh them, and there came a smell off the\r\nshore, like the smell of a garden.\" On the 12th, they came to anchor in\r\nSalem harbor, and by 14th of July, thirteen out of the fourteen ships\r\nhad arrived safely, the other vessel, the Mary & John, was the first to\r\narrive, and had landed their passengers at Dorchester. Governor\r\nWinthrop, after his arrival at Salem, determined to remove to a point of\r\nland between two rivers flowing into Boston Harbor, and named the town\r\nCharlestown, in honor of Charles I. The next year the Governor caused\r\nthe settlement to remove across the Charles river to another point of\r\nland called by the Indians \"Shawmut,\" signifying the place of living\r\nwaters, which caused the removal there. The Governor settled alongside\r\nof the \"Great Spring\" on the present site of the Old South church, next\r\nto Spring Lane, which runs into Water street, hence the name. The place\r\nwas called Boston, named after Boston, Lincolnshire, England, from which\r\nplace some of the settlers came, and the County was named Suffolk. Thus\r\nBoston was settled by the English Puritans under the leadership of\r\nGovernor Winthrop.[253]\r\n\r\n  [253] For a detailed account of the career and writings of this\r\n  illustrious man, see two volumes of his \"Life And Letters,\" by his\r\n  descendant, Hon. Robert C. Winthrop.\r\n\r\nGovernor Winthrop had five daughters and two sons, the elder resided\r\nchiefly in Connecticut and the younger in Massachusetts, generally known\r\nas, VI, Wait Still Winthrop or Wait Winthrop, born in Boston, Feb. 27,\r\n1642, died Nov. 7, 1717. A soldier of the Indian wars, for more than\r\nthirty years Major General commanding the Provincial Forces of Mass.,\r\nJudge of the Superior Court, Judge of Admiralty and some time Chief\r\nJustice of Mass. He married Mary, daughter of Hon. William Brown, of\r\nSalem, by whom he had one daughter, Ann, wife of Thomas Lechmere,\r\nbrother of Lord Lechmere, and an only son, VII, John Winthrop, born in\r\nBoston, Aug. 26, 1681, died at Sydenham Aug. 1, 1742, graduated at\r\nHarvard College in 1700. Failing to receive the political preferment to\r\nwhich claim he conceived a sort of hereditary claim, he went to England\r\nto reside in 1727. He became an active member of Royal Society, of whose\r\ntransactions one volume is dedicated to him, he resided there until his\r\ndeath. He had five daughters and two sons, the eldest, VIII, John Still\r\nWinthrop, born in Boston, Jan. 15, 1720, died June 6, 1776. Graduated at\r\nYale College in 1737. In early life he resided with his father in\r\nEngland, and occasionally in Boston, but after his marriage, chiefly in\r\nNew London, Conn., where he built a large house, still standing at the\r\nhead of Winthrop's Cove, described in 1787 as the best house in the\r\nProvince. He had fourteen children, five daughters and nine sons. Of his\r\nsons, two died in childhood. John and William died unmarried. Francis\r\nBayard Winthrop went to New York, also Benjamin Winthrop. Joseph\r\nWinthrop went to Charleston, S. C.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS LINDALL WINTHROP. Born March 6, 1760, died in Boston, Feb. 21,\r\n1841. Graduated at Harvard College 1780, was Lieutenant Governor of\r\nMassachusetts from 1826 to 1833. He married in 1786, Elizabeth, daughter\r\nof Sir John Temple, Bart., and granddaughter of James Bowdoin of Boston,\r\nGovernor of Massachusetts. Their son, the Hon. Robert C. Winthrop, was\r\nthe most conspicuous member of the family in America for a long period.\r\nIn his memoir of the Winthrop family he says \"From the above five\r\nbrothers descend the numerous branches of the Winthrop family, now\r\nwidely scattered in different parts of the United States and\r\nEurope.\"[254] It does not appear that either of them joined the\r\nrevolutionists or took any part in the war, except the youngest son, who\r\nwas a staunch loyalist, and was of great service to his country.\r\n\r\n  [254] A Short Account of the Winthrop family by Robert C. Winthrop.\r\n\r\nThe youngest son of John Still Winthrop, was, IX, Robert Winthrop, the\r\nsubject of this sketch, born in New London, Dec. 7, 1764, died at Dover,\r\nEngland, May 10, 1832. During the Revolution he was appointed a\r\nMidshipman in the Royal Navy. In 1790 he was a Lieutenant; and six\r\nyears later a Post Captain. He attained the rank of Rear Admiral in\r\n1809, and of Vice Admiral in 1830. He served on board of the flagship of\r\nSir George B. Rodney in the memorable victory over the French April 12,\r\n1782. The French Admiral, Count de Grasse, fresh from his victory at\r\nYorktown, had refitted at Martinique's dock yards, and with the\r\nassistance of the Spaniards, who had fitted out a fleet at Havana,\r\nintended to capture Jamaica, and drive the English out of the West\r\nIndies. All the Lesser Antilles were his own, except St. Lucia. There\r\nalone the English flag still flew as Rodney lay in the harbor of\r\nCastries, and saw the French fleet becalmed under the high lands of\r\nDominica. All day long the cannon roared, and one by one the French\r\nships struck their flags or fought on till they sank. Rodney's flagship\r\ncame alongside of the Ville de Paris, the pride of France and the\r\nlargest ship in the world, on which De Grasse commanded in person. He\r\nfought after all hope had gone, with her masts shattered, her decks\r\nlittered with mangled limbs and bodies. He gave up his sword to Rodney.\r\nThe French fleet was destroyed, fourteen thousand were killed, besides\r\nthe prisoners. On that memorable day the British Empire was saved and\r\nYorktown was avenged. He was at the conquest of Martinique and St. Lucia\r\nin 1794, also captured a French corvette. He was wrecked in the frigate\r\nUndaunted. He was on duty in the North Sea. He superintended the landing\r\nof troops in the expedition against Ostend. Entrusted with a small\r\nsquadron to cruise off Holland, his boats burned a store-ship, made\r\nprize of fifteen merchant vessels, a sloop-of-war, and an armed\r\nschooner. He assisted in the capture of the Helder. Stranded in the\r\nfrigate Stag, he was compelled, after saving her stores, to burn her.\r\nStationed on the coast of Spain, in the Ardent of sixty-four guns, he\r\ndrove on shore a French frigate, which was set on fire and burned by her\r\nown crew. Such is the bare outline of the great services he rendered on\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\nIn 1807 the Sea Fencibles of the Dover district was placed under his\r\norders. He married Miss Farbrace. He died at Dover in 1832. Two sons and\r\nfour daughters survived him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            NATHANIEL HATCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Estes Hatch was one of the most prominent and wealthy men of\r\nDorchester. He owned many negro slaves who worked on his extensive\r\nestate, comprising sixty acres of land on the southerly side of Dudley\r\nstreet, lying part in Roxbury and a part in Dorchester. It included\r\nLittle Woods, afterward known as Swan's woods.\r\n\r\nCol. Hatch commanded the Troop of Horse, in Boston, led a company at the\r\ncapture of Louisberg and died in 1759. He was prominent in town affairs,\r\nand held the principal military offices, and at the time of his death\r\nwas Brigadier General of Horse. His wife was Mary, daughter of Rev.\r\nBenjamin Rolfe, her father and mother and their youngest child were\r\nkilled by the Indians in their home at Haverhill in 1708. Col. Hatch and\r\nMary Rolfe were married Nov. 9th, 1716.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL HATCH, son of Col. Hatch, graduated at Harvard College in\r\n1742, and subsequently held the office of Clerk of the Courts. He was a\r\nfirm loyalist, and at the evacuation of Boston in 1776, he went to\r\nHalifax with the British troops. In 1778 he was proscribed and banished,\r\nand in 1779 was included in the Conspiracy Act, by which his large and\r\nvaluable estate was confiscated, it was bought afterwards by Captain\r\nJames Swan, who paid L18,000 for it, and who soon afterwards offered it\r\nto Gov. Hancock for L45,000. Writing to Hancock, Swan say: \"The mansion\r\nhouse can be refitted in as elegant a manner as it once was for about\r\nL4,000.\" During Swan's residence here he made the house a seat of\r\nhospitality, entertaining among others persons of distinction. The\r\nMarquis de Viomel, second in command of Rochambeau's army, Admiral\r\nd'Estaing, the Marquis de Lafayette and General Knox.[255]\r\n\r\n  [255] Town of Roxbury by F. S. Drake.

He sailed from Barnstable, Devon County in\r\nMay, 1631, in the ship Friendship, arriving in Boston July 14th, 1631.\r\nJohn Chipman was the first and only one of the name to seek a home in\r\nAmerica, and up to 1850 there was no Chipman in this country who was not\r\ndescended from him. He was for many years a selectman, then in Plymouth\r\nCounty invested with the authority of a magistrate, and was often a\r\n\"Deputy to Court\" and he, with three assistants, was designated to\r\nfrequent the early Quaker meetings and \"endeavor to reduce them from the\r\nerrors of their wayes\".

While\r\narguing a case before the Superior Court at Falmouth (Portland), Maine,\r\nhe was suddenly seized with apoplexy, from which he died. He had twelve\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nWARD CHIPMAN, the subject of this biography, was of the fifth\r\ngeneration, and the fourth son of the aforesaid John Chipman.

His remains were conveyed from\r\nFredericton to St. John where a tablet, adds to above quoted statement,\r\nthe following: \"Distinguished during the whole of his varied and active\r\nlife, for his superior abilities and unweariable zeal, for genuine\r\nintegrity and singular humanity and benevolence, his loss was\r\nuniversally deplored; and this frail tribute from his nearest connection\r\naffords but a feeble expression of the affectionate respect with which\r\nthey cherished the memory of his virtues.\"\r\n\r\nHon. Ward Chipman married Elizabeth, daughter of Hon. William Hazen of\r\nHaverhill, Mass., and his wife, the only daughter of Dr. Joseph LeBaron\r\nof Plymouth, Mass. She died at St. John in 1852 in her eighty-sixth\r\nyear. The wife of Hon. William Gray of Boston was his sister. Ward, his\r\nonly child, was born July 21, 1787, graduated at Harvard College in\r\n1805, where so many of his ancestors had before him. He held many places\r\nof honor and trust; was finally chief justice of New Brunswick, and died\r\nat St. John in 1851 in his sixty-fifth year. While the Prince of Wales,\r\nnow King Edward VII., was in that city in August, 1860, he occupied the\r\nChipman mansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        GOVERNOR EDWARD WINSLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward Winslow was born at Droitwich, Worcestershire, England, 19\r\nOctober, 1595. He appears to have been a well educated and accomplished\r\nman. In the course of his travels on the continent of Europe he went to\r\nLeyden and there became acquainted with Mr. John Robinson, and the\r\nchurch under his pastoral charge, which he joined in 1617. He married\r\nthe 16th of May, 1618, and settled in that city till the church removed\r\nto America in 1620. In his \"Brief Narration\" he says: And when the ship\r\nwas ready to carry us away the bretheren that stayed feasted us that\r\nwere to go at our pastor's home. After tears and singing of psalms they\r\naccompanied us to Delph's Haven, where we were to embark, and there\r\nfeasted us again. But we, going aboard ship lying at the quay ready to\r\nsail, the wind fair, we gave them a volley of small shot and three\r\npieces of ordnance, and so lifting up our hands to each other and our\r\nhearts to the Lord we departed, etc.\r\n\r\nWinslow's name is third on the list of those who subscribed to the\r\nCovenant, or compact, before the disembarkation at Cape Cod. He was one\r\nof the first who came on shore to seek out the most eligible place for\r\nfounding a settlement in this wild and unknown land. He was a gentleman\r\nof the best family of any of the Pilgrims, his father, Edward Winslow,\r\nEsq., being a person of importance in Droitwich. In all the initiatory\r\nlabor for establishing this little colony, the nucleus of a great\r\nnation, he was ever active and influential in promoting the welfare of\r\nthe Pilgrims, who on account of the respectability of his family, and\r\nthe excellent qualities of his mind and heart appear to have regarded\r\nhim with more than ordinary respect and confidence, which was never\r\nmisplaced.\r\n\r\nAt the annual election in 1624 Mr. Winslow was elected Assistant and in\r\n1644 Governor of Plymouth Colony.\r\n\r\nIn 1655 Oliver Cromwell appointed three commissioners, of which number\r\nWinslow was the chief, to go with an expedition against the Spaniards in\r\nthe West Indies under Admiral Penn and General Venables. The three\r\ncommissioners to direct their operations. After an unsuccessful attack\r\non St. Domingo, the fleet sailed for Jamaica, which surrendered without\r\nany resistance. But Mr. Winslow, who partook of the chagrin of defeat,\r\ndid not live to enjoy the pleasure of victory. In the passage between\r\nHispaniola and Jamaica the heat of the climate threw him into a fever,\r\nwhich put an end to his life on May 8, 1655, in the sixty-first year of\r\nhis age. His body was committed to the deep, with the honors of war,\r\nforty-two guns being fired by the fleet on that occasion.\r\n\r\nAfter Bradford, Plymouth Colony owed to no man so much as to Edward\r\nWinslow. Always intelligent, generous, confident, and indefatigable, he\r\nwas undoubtingly trusted for any service at home or abroad which the\r\ninfant settlement required.\r\n\r\nJOSIAH WINSLOW, the only surviving son of Governor Edward Winslow, was\r\nborn at Plymouth in 1629 and died on the family estate, Careswell,\r\nMarshfield, Dec. 18, 1680, in the 52nd year of his age. He was buried at\r\nthe expense of the colony \"in testimony of the colony's endeared love\r\nand affection for him.\" He married Penelope, daughter of Herbert Pelham,\r\nEsq., who came to Boston in 1645.\r\n\r\nHe stood upon the uppermost heights of society, he reached every\r\nelevation that could be obtained, and there was nothing left for\r\nambition to covet, because all had been gained. He was the first\r\nnative-born general and the first native-born governor. The governor\r\nacquired the highest military rank and had engaged in active and\r\nsuccessful warfare with the highest command in New England. He presided\r\nover the legislative, executive and judicial departments of the\r\ngovernment. In addition to his military and civil distinction he\r\nacquired that of being the most delightful companion in the colony. He\r\nlived on his ample paternal domain and his hospitality was magnificent\r\nand the attractions of the festive board at Careswell were heightened by\r\nthe charm of his beautiful wife. He was elected governor in 1673, which\r\noffice he held until his death. He was succeeded by his only surviving\r\nson.\r\n\r\nISAAC WINSLOW, born in 1670 and died Dec. 6, 1738. This eminently\r\ndistinguished man sustained the chief places of power and honor in the\r\ncolony, and was a worthy successor to his father in being its chief\r\nmilitary commander, a member of the Council for more than 20 years and\r\nfor some time its president, and for several years Chief Justice of the\r\nCourt of Common Pleas, and Judge of Probate; the last office he held at\r\nhis death. His eldest son, Josiah, graduated at Harvard College in 1721,\r\nwas killed in battle with the French and Indians at Georges Island, May\r\n1st, 1724. His second son, great grandson of the first governor of\r\nPlymouth, was the celebrated\r\n\r\nJOHN WINSLOW, born in Marshfield, May 27, 1702, and died in Hingham,\r\n1774, in his 73rd year. No native of New England, probably, except Sir\r\nWilliam Pepperell, was more distinguished as a military leader. In\r\n1740-1 he was a captain in the unfortunate expedition to Cartagena under\r\nthe command of Admiral Vernon, and subsequently endured much hard\r\nservice in the several enterprises against Crown Point and Nova Scotia.\r\nHe will be remembered in our annals principally in removing the\r\nArcadians from Nova Scotia. The forces employed by the Colony at this\r\nperiod was composed almost entirely of Massachusetts troops, specially\r\nenlisted for the service to act as a distinct body. They formed into a\r\nregiment of two battalions, of which Governor Shirley was the Colonel,\r\nand of which Winslow, then a half-pay Captain in the British army and a\r\nMajor-General in the Militia, was Lieutenant-Colonel. As Shirley could\r\nnot leave his government to take command in person, Monckton, a\r\nLieutenant-Colonel in the Army, was appointed to conduct the first\r\nbattalion and Winslow the second. The plan for abducting the Arcadians\r\nwas kept a profound secret, both by those who formed it and by those who\r\nwere sent to execute, the home government knew nothing about it and it\r\nappears to have been done solely by the Colonial government; Colonel\r\nWinslow was but the instrument and acted under the Governor's written\r\nand positive instructions.\r\n\r\nIn 1756 Major-General Winslow took the field with eight thousand men\r\nraised in New England and New York to repel the French invasion and\r\nmarched against Montcalm, who to save Crown Point and Ticonderoga made a\r\nmovement from Oswego by the St. Lawrence River. As soon as the French\r\nGeneral returned to Canada, Winslow and his army returned to\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nIn 1762 he was appointed with William Brattle and James Otis to act as\r\nCommissioner \"to repair to the river St. Croix, determine where the\r\neasterly line of Maine is to begin and extend the said line as far as\r\nshould be thought necessary.\" In compliment to General Winslow, \"the\r\nfourth of a family more eminent for their talents, learning and honors\r\nthan any other in New England,\" one of the towns on the Kennebec River\r\nin 1771 was called by his name. Of this town he was one of the original\r\ngrantees. He died at Hingham in 1774, aged seventy-one, leaving two sons\r\nand a widow, who embarked with the Royal Army from Boston in 1776. She\r\nwas in England in 1783, and enjoyed a pension from the government.\r\n\r\nPelham Winslow, eldest son of General John, was born June 8th, 1737,\r\ngraduated at Harvard College in 1753, and entered the office of James\r\nOtis to fit himself for the bar, was a staunch loyalist. In 1774 he\r\nabandoned his home to escape mob violence and took refuge in Boston. At\r\nthe evacuation in 1776 he accompanied the Royal Army to Halifax, and\r\nthence went to New York, where he entered the military service of the\r\nCrown, and was Major. In 1778 he was proscribed and banished. He died at\r\nBrooklyn, New York, in 1783, leaving a wife and an infant daughter.\r\n\r\nDr. Isaac Winslow, second son of General John, born April 7, 1739,\r\ngraduated at Harvard College in 1762, died in 1819. He commenced the\r\npractice of physic, and though of the same principles as other members\r\nof his family, remained upon his estate during the war, and his life,\r\nthereby saving it from confiscation, for although he was a strong\r\nloyalist his medical services were of such great value to the\r\nrevolutionists that they did not drive him forth and deprive him of his\r\nproperty. Sabine says: I find it said, and the authority good, that in\r\n1778 he treated about three hundred patients inoculated with smallpox,\r\nand such was his remarkable success not one of them died. His son John,\r\nan eminent lawyer, deceased at Natchez in 1820. His widow, Frances, died\r\nat Hingham in 1846, aged eighty-four. The family tomb of the Winslows is\r\nat Marshfield, on the Careswell estate, of which Governor Winslow was\r\nthe first owner. It was afterwards purchased by Daniel Webster, on which\r\nhe resided until his death.\r\n\r\nEDWARD WINSLOW, only brother of General John, born June 7, 1714, died at\r\nHalifax in 1784, aged seventy-two years. He graduated at Harvard College\r\nin 1765, resided at Plymouth, was Clerk of the Courts, Register of\r\nProbate, Collector of the Port. He was obliged to seek shelter in Boston\r\nfrom mob violence, at the evacuation in 1776 went with the Army to\r\nHalifax, Nova Scotia, where he died. The ceremonies at his funeral were\r\nof a style to confer the highest honors to himself, and his illustrious\r\nfamily. His estates in Massachusetts were confiscated, but every branch\r\nof his family was amply provided for by the generosity of the British\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nEDWARD WINSLOW, JR., only son of the aforesaid Edward. He was born in\r\n1745, died at Fredericton, N. B., 1815, aged seventy years, graduated at\r\nHarvard College in 1765. In 1774, the Plymouth County Convention\r\n\"Resolved, That Edward Winslow, Jr., one of the two clerks of the Court\r\nof General Sessions of the Peace and Court of Common Pleas for this\r\nCounty, has, by refusing this body a copy of an Address made at the last\r\nterm in this County, to Thomas Hutchinson, Esq., betrayed the trust\r\nreposed in him, by refusing his attendance when requested, treated the\r\nbody of this county with insult and contempt, and by that means rendered\r\nhimself unworthy to serve the county in said office.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1775 he joined the Royal Army at Boston, and entering the service\r\nbecame a Colonel. In 1778 he was proscribed and banished. In 1782 he was\r\nMuster-Master-General of the Loyalist forces employed under the Crown.\r\nAfter the war he settled in New Brunswick, and was a member of the first\r\nCouncil formed in that Colony, Surrogate-General, Judge of the Supreme\r\nCourt, and finally Administrator of the Government. The Royal Arms which\r\nfor many years were displayed in the Council Chamber in the Old State\r\nHouse in Boston, still exist, and are carefully preserved in Trinity\r\nchurch, St. John, N. B. The story of their exit from Boston, and by what\r\nmeans they came to find a permanent home at St. John, were not known\r\ntill recently, when documents were found, which leave no question or\r\nroom for doubt.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1785 Edward Winslow was at Halifax and Ward Chipman, a\r\nfellow refugee from Boston, had taken up his residence at St. John. In a\r\nletter of Mr. Winslow to Mr. Chipman on the 16th January, 1785, he says,\r\n\"Give my old Custom House seal to Mr. Leonard, and tell him I'll forward\r\n_the famous carv'd Coat of Arms_ by the first conveyance from Halifax.\"\r\nA subsequent letter to Mr. Chipman, refers more fully to the subject\r\nwhich is in part as follows:\r\n\r\n                                                 Halifax, 25 March, 1785.\r\n\r\n     My Dear Fellow:\r\n\r\n     By the schooner Halifax I send a small assortment of stationery as\r\n     per invoice.... In the box with your stationery is a venerable Coat\r\n     of Arms, which I authorize you to present to the Council Chamber,\r\n     or any other respectable public Room, which you shall think best\r\n     entitled to it.

WINSLOW.[258]\r\n  Ward Chipman, Esq.\r\n\r\n  [258] See Royal Memorials by Rev. Edmund F. Shafter. Also cut of Coat of\r\n  Arms on outside cover of this work.\r\n\r\nJudge Winslow was one of the founders of the Old Colony Club, at\r\nPlymouth, and was one of its most active members. He delivered the first\r\nanniversary address of that association on the 22 of December or\r\nForefathers' Day, in 1770.\r\n\r\nISAAC WINSLOW was a Boston merchant, son of Col. Edward Winslow, born\r\nMay 2, 1709. He was the third in descent from John Winslow who came from\r\nDroitwich to Boston in 1655, and died in 1674. He was a brother of\r\nGovernor Edward of the Plymouth Colony. He was a gentleman highly\r\nesteemed for his benevolence and other virtues. He graduated at Harvard\r\nCollege in 1727, then entered the counting room of James Bowdoin, and\r\nsubsequently with his brother Joshua carried on an extensive and\r\nprofitable business in Boston. They also became considerable ship\r\nowners, and had one ship constantly in the London trade. Joshua was one\r\nof the consignees of the tea destroyed by the mob. Isaac retired from\r\nbusiness in 1753, and became a resident of Roxbury. He was the last\r\noccupant of the Dudley mansion, which was razed to the ground a few days\r\nafter the battle of Bunker Hill, to make way for the works erected here\r\nby the Americans. The Universalist church was built upon its site. In\r\nmaking the necessary excavation for the church, the wine cellar of the\r\nmansion was unearthed and strange to say, as it may seem, the liquors\r\nwere, after a lapse of forty-five years, found intact.[259]\r\n\r\n  [259] The Town of Roxbury. Francis S. Drake, pp. 355-6.\r\n\r\nIn June 1760 he received the thanks of the town for a gift of land near\r\nMeeting House Hill. His first wife, Lucy, daughter of Gen. Samuel Waldo,\r\ndied in Roxbury in 1763, at the age of forty-three.\r\n\r\nIn 1774 he was an Addresser of Gov. Hutchinson, and 1775 of Gen. Gage.\r\nHe was appointed Mandamus Councillor, and was qualified. This was an\r\noffence that could not be forgiven by the disunionists.\r\n\r\nThough a loyalist, his moderation and his character made him less\r\nobnoxious to the revolutionists than his neighbors, Auchmuty, Hallowell,\r\nand Loring. His virtues, however, could not save him from the fury of\r\nthe mob. Immediately after the Lexington affair, he took refuge in\r\nBoston.\r\n\r\nIn 1776, with his family of ten persons, he accompanied the Royal Army\r\nto Halifax, and in 1778 was proscribed and banished, and his estates\r\nconfiscated. In his religious belief he was a Sandemanian. Jemima, his\r\nwidow, died at London in 1790.\r\n\r\nREV. EDWARD WINSLOW was an Episcopal minister of Braintree, now Quincy,\r\nMass. He was born in Boston in 1722. Graduated at Harvard College in\r\n1741. His father Joshua was a brother of the aforesaid Isaac Winslow,\r\nand son of Colonel Edward Winslow.\r\n\r\nThe North Precinct of Braintree, now Quincy, had the reputation of being\r\na \"nest of Tories,\" owing to the presence of the Church of England\r\npeople, connected with Christ Church. The mother English society was\r\nmost liberal in dealing with its offshoot and until the Revolution, it\r\nannually sent over sixty pounds sterling for the support of the\r\nminister. In all, it is said to have spent over thirteen thousand\r\ndollars in building up this church. Naturally the society was inclined\r\nto a friendly feeling toward the hand which fed it. To it the\r\nApthorpe's, the Vassall's, the Borland's, the Cleverly's and the\r\nMillers, indeed all the gentry of the neighborhood with the exception of\r\nthe Quincy's, belonged, the Adam's not being in this class at that time.\r\nIt was here the same as elsewhere throughout the colonies, the ministers\r\nof the Established Church of England stood condemned in the eyes of\r\nrevolutionists, neither seclusion, insignificance nor high character was\r\nable to save the clergy from the fury of the mobs.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1777, a town meeting was called for the purpose of agreeing\r\nupon a list of those persons who were \"esteemed inimical\" to the popular\r\ncause. This was in the nature of a formal indictment of the whole\r\nsociety, for among the names of those recorded as \"inimical\" were its\r\nrector, its wardens, and all its leading members.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Edward Winslow, the rector of Christ Church, found his\r\nsituation uncomfortable in the extreme, nor was it any longer safe for\r\nhim to read the prayer for the King. Yet he seems to have struggled on\r\nvainly hoping for better days, until his salary was stopped, and many of\r\nhis people had moved away. Then in 1777, taking very properly the ground\r\nthat his ordination oath compelled him to conform literally to the\r\nPrayer Book he \"with sad and silent musings\" resigned his charge. Going\r\nto New York, which was then in British occupation, Mr. Winslow died\r\nthere in 1780 before the close of the war. He lies buried under the\r\naltar of St. George's Church in that city. Jane Isabella, his widow,\r\ndied at Fayetteville, North Carolina, in 1793, aged sixty-six.\r\n\r\nJoseph Winslow of Boston was a merchant, he was born in 1724, and died\r\nin 1777, was the son of Kenelm, the great grandson of Kenelm of\r\nDroitwich, the brother of Governor Winslow, who died at Salem in 1672.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR ROGER HALE SHEAFFE, BARONET.\r\n\r\nBorn in Boston in 1763. Though reluctant to serve against his\r\ncountrymen, yet at Queenstown's Heights he drove the American army over\r\nthe heights into the Niagra river, for which he received the title of\r\nBaronet. Died at Edinburgh in 1851.]\r\n\r\nHe was possibly the Joseph Winslow who took part at the Siege of\r\nLouisberg, and was amongst the number to volunteer under the command of\r\nBacon to attack the island Battery, and was the Joseph Winslow referred\r\nto by the Committee of Newport, R. I., of which Jonathan Otis was\r\nchairman, who wrote to the Committee of Easthampton, New York, in June,\r\n1775, that he was \"an inveterate enemy of our country\" and that \"it was\r\ngenerally thought he had gone to a hospital to take the small pox for\r\nthe purpose of spreading the disease in the Whig Camp at Cambridge.\"\r\nSabine says the truth of this averment may be doubted.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF CONFISCATED ESTATES BELONGING TO ISAAC WINSLOW IN SUFFOLK COUNTY\r\n                              AND TO WHOM SOLD.\r\n\r\n     To Ebenezer Crosbey, June 15, 1782; Lib. 135, fol. 20; Assignment\r\n       of mortgage Joseph Crosby to Isaac Winslow, dated Aug. 5, 1768.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SIR ROGER HALE SHEAFFE, BARONET.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM S. SHEAFFE, of Charlestown, was born in 1649, and married in\r\n1672 Ruth Woods. He was a mariner, and they had three sons and three\r\ndaughters. His son William, born 1683, married Mary Longfellow, a widow,\r\nin 1704. He died in 1718, and his widow in 1720. They had five sons and\r\ntwo daughters. His eldest son William Sheaffe, Jr., was born 13 Jan.,\r\n1705. He graduated at Harvard College in 1723, and married Susanna\r\nChild, Oct. 1st, 1752.[260]\r\n\r\n  [260] There was a family of Sheaffe's in Boston much earlier than 1672,\r\n  when William Sheaffe's name first appears on the records, but I do not\r\n  find any connection between the two families, except that James Sheaffe\r\n  of Portsmouth, N. H., of the Boston family, was a loyalist. He was\r\n  allowed to remain, although much persecuted. (See Heraldic Journal, Vol.\r\n  IX. p. 85, also Wyman's Genealogies and Estates of Charlestown, and\r\n  History of Portsmouth, N. H.)\r\n\r\nWILLIAM SHEAFFE was Deputy Collector of Customs of Boston. He frequently\r\nacted as Collector in the absence of Sir Henry Frankland, who held that\r\noffice in 1759, and when the Baronet was removed for inattention to his\r\nduties, he was appointed to fill the vacant place, and issued the\r\ncelebrated \"Writs of Assistance,\" giving the Revenue officers the right\r\nto search for smuggled goods. Roger Hale succeeded as Collector in 1672,\r\nwhen Sheaffe was again Deputy. He continued in that office under Joseph\r\nHarrison, who was the last Royal Collector of the port. Mr. Sheaffe died\r\nin 1771, leaving a large family in poverty. There is ample evidence that\r\nMrs. Sheaffe was an intelligent, excellent woman, and bore many trials\r\nwith pious resignation, and that the Sheaffe's were a loving and happy\r\nfamily. Mrs. Sheaffe died in 1811.\r\n\r\nSUSANNA, Mr. Sheaffe's eldest daughter, who died in 1834, married\r\nCaptain Ponsonby Molesworth, a nephew of Lord Ponsonby. The family\r\naccount is that on the day of the landing of the British troops in\r\nBoston, a regiment halted in Queen (Court) street, opposite Mr.\r\nSheaffe's house, that, Susanna attracted by the music, accompanied by\r\nher younger sisters, went upon the balcony, that Captain Molesworth saw\r\nher, was struck with her great beauty, gazed upon her intently, and at\r\nlast, said to a brother officer, who like himself was leaning against a\r\nfence, \"That girl seals my fate.\" An introduction, and a visit followed,\r\nand the maiden's heart rapidly won, but then came sorrow, for Susanna\r\nwas barely fifteen, and parental consent to her marriage was refused.\r\nHer governess, to whom she entrusted her grief, espoused her cause, and\r\nfavored immediate union, and the result accordingly was, the flight of\r\nthe three to Rhode Island, where the loving pair were married.\r\nMolesworth sold his commission in 1776, and in December of that year was\r\nin England with his wife. Their married life proved uncommonly happy;\r\nand they lived to see their children's children.\r\n\r\nAnother daughter, Helen, of remarkable beauty, married a revolutionist,\r\nJames Lovell, who became Naval Officer of Boston. Their grandson,\r\nMansfield Lovell, was a General in the Confederate service, and was in\r\ncommand at New Orleans, when it was captured by the Union forces. The\r\nGeneral was true to the disunion instincts of his grandfather.\r\n\r\nSIR ROGER HALE SHEAFFE, BARONET, the subject of this sketch, was son of\r\nWilliam Sheaffe. Born in Boston in 1763. His mother, after the death of\r\nhis father, removed to a wooden house which was standing till recently\r\non the corner of Essex and Columbia (formerly Auchmuty street) which was\r\nowned by her father. Lord Percy, afterward, Duke of Northumberland hired\r\nquarters there, soon became attached to Roger, and assumed the care of\r\nhim. It would seem that the original intention of his Lordship was to\r\nprovide for the boy in the Navy, for Mrs. Sheaffe wrote, in December\r\n1776, she was told \"Earl Percy had taken my son Roger from the Admiral's\r\nship, given him a commission in the Army (which I must not say that I am\r\nsorry for), and sent him to England to an academy for education under\r\nhis patronage.\" In 1778 Roger was dangerously ill, and on becoming\r\nconvalescent, passed two months in Devonshire, with his sister, Mrs.\r\nMolesworth. In a letter dated at the Academy, Little Chelsea, early in\r\n1779, he said, Lord Percy is as good as ever. He has given me a\r\ncommission in his own regiment, the Fifth, now in the West Indies. I\r\nshall not join it for a year.\r\n\r\nMy love to my dear sister and brother. Remember me kindly to all my\r\nfriends in Boston. You may be sure that I shall follow your advice\r\nstrictly, that I may be all that you wish, shall be the endeavor of your\r\nmost dutiful and affectionate son.\r\n\r\nIn 1786 Captain Molesworth said in a letter to his mother-in-law, Mrs.\r\nSheaffe, The Duke of Northumberland has lodged money to buy Roger a\r\nCompany, which, when he is in possession of, he will have it in his\r\npower more fully to manifest his affection for so good a mother. Roger's\r\nsister, Mrs. Molesworth, at the same period wrote her mother, \"He is as\r\ngood a young man as ever lived. Lord Percy continues his kindness to\r\nhim. He improves very much, and is a great favorite with all his\r\nmasters.\" Again, \"Roger behaves remarkably well, is much liked in the\r\nRegiment; he is tall, well made, and reckoned handsome, very lively, yet\r\nprudent and steady in matters of consequence. He wishes, as much as we\r\ndo, to go to Boston.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1791 Lieutenant Sheaffe was at Detroit, which post was still held by\r\nEngland, on account of the non-fulfillment of some of the terms of the\r\ntreaty of peace. In 1794, before the surrender of the \"Western Posts\" as\r\nthey were called, Lieutenant Sheaffe delivered a letter to Capt.\r\nWilliamson, which was unequivocally of a military and hostile nature.\r\n\r\n\"I am commanded to declare that during the inexecution of the treaty of\r\npeace between Great Britain and the United States, and until the\r\nexisting differences respecting it, shall be mutually and finally\r\nadjusted, the taking possession of any part of the Indian territory,\r\neither for purposes of war or sovereignty, is held to be a direct\r\nviolation of his Britannic Majesty's rights, as they unquestionably\r\nexisted before the treaty, and has an immediate tendency to interrupt,\r\nand in its progress destroy, that good understanding which has hitherto\r\nsubsisted between his Britannic Majesty and the United States of\r\nAmerica. I, therefore require you to desist from any such aggression. R.\r\nH. Sheaffe, Lieut. 5th Reg't. and Qr. M'r. Gen. Dept. of his Britannic\r\nMajesty's service.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1801 he was in service in the attack on Copenhagen under Lord Nelson;\r\nand though poor, just one-half of his prize money was sent to his mother\r\nin Boston.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Queenstown Heights, he was a Colonel in General Brocks\r\narmy; that gallant officer was slain at 7 o'clock in the morning. At\r\nnoon, Colonel Sheaffe moved up from Niagara, took command of the forces\r\nand drove the Americans over the rocky heights into the river. For this\r\nvictory he was made a Major General, and created a Baronet. At this\r\nperiod General Scott (who was the conqueror of Mexico, and Commander in\r\nChief of the United States forces at the outbreak of the Civil War,) was\r\na Colonel, and was taken prisoner by General Sheaffe, who related to him\r\nsome of the circumstances of his military career, in substance, that in\r\n1775, he was living in Boston with his widowed mother with whom Earl\r\nPercy had his quarters, that his Lordship was very fond of him, and took\r\nhim away with him in view of providing for him, which he did, by giving\r\nhim a military education, and by purchasing a commission and promotion\r\nto as high rank as is allowed by the rules of the service, and that the\r\nwar then existing found him stationed in Canada. He stated moreover,\r\nthat, reluctant to serve gainst his own countrymen, he solicited to be\r\nemployed elsewhere, but at that time his request had not been granted.\r\n\r\nMajor General Sheaffe, commanded the British Army in person, and after\r\nthe battle of Queenstown Heights, he moved upon Little York, now\r\nToronto, and captured it. During these operations he lost his baggage\r\nand papers, which General Dearborn informed the Secretary of War \"were a\r\nvaluable acquisition.\"\r\n\r\nIn April, 1813, within a week of the fall of Little York, in a letter\r\nfrom his wife's mother to her niece, Miss Child, dated at Quebec, she\r\nsays, \"It is possible that you may not have heard that your cousin, Sir\r\nRoger Sheaffe has had the title of Baronet of Great Britain conferred on\r\nhim, by our Prince Regent, a handsome compliment, which I trust will be\r\nfollowed by something substantial to support it. Sir Roger is so pressed\r\nwith public business as to allow him scarcely time to attend to his\r\nprivate concerns. My dear Margaret is still in Quebec, with her lovely\r\nlittle Julia, as Upper Canada is still the seat of war. Her elevation to\r\nrank, has not in the least deprived her of her native humility and\r\nmeekness. The manner it was announced to her was rather singular. She\r\nwas met by a gentleman in the street, as she was going to church, who\r\naccosted her by the title of 'Lady Sheaffe', and put a letter in her\r\nhand from the Duke of Northumberland, addressed to 'Lady Sheaffe' which\r\nshe received with her usual equanimity.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1841 he writes to his cousin, Miss Susan Child of Boston, \"The year\r\n1834 was indeed a sad one, in it we lost the last of our children, and\r\nin the same year died my sister Molesworth, a brother of Lady Sheaffe,\r\nmy late brother William's eldest son, named after me, a Captain in the\r\nArmy, and also Lord Cragie, the brother of your cousin, Mrs. Cragie's\r\nhusband. I retain a good share of activity, as well as of erect military\r\ncarriage, my sight is good, my teeth in a state to create envy in a\r\nmajority of American misses, my appetite never fails and I sleep well.\"\r\nIn January, 1842, he spoke of William, eldest surviving son of his\r\nbrother William thus: \"He is my natural heir, and having adopted him when\r\nhe was ten years of age; and it having pleased God to take all my\r\nchildren from me. I regard him as a son.\"\r\n\r\nSir Roger H. Sheaffe died at Edinburgh in 1851, aged eighty-eight. He\r\nvisited Boston, his native town, four times, namely, in 1788, in 1792-3,\r\nin 1803 and in 1806. He was respected and loved by his kinsmen to a\r\nremarkable degree. He was of medium stature, his person was well formed,\r\nhis face was fine, his eyes of the deepest blue, full and prominent; and\r\nhis teeth were of the purest white, regular and even, and were retained\r\nto the close of his life. Lady Sheaffe was Margrate, daughter of John\r\nCoffin and a cousin of Lieutenant-General John and of Admiral Sir Isaac\r\nCoffin. She was the mother of four children, who, as we have seen, died\r\nbefore her husband. The remains of Sir Roger's father and mother, of his\r\nbrother Thomas Child, of his sisters Helen, Salley, Nancy, and Margaret,\r\nand of others of his lineage, were deposited in the Child Tomb, Trinity\r\nChurch, Summer street, Boston.[261]\r\n\r\n  [261] Most of the information contained in this article was obtained by\r\n  L. Sabine, from Miss Isabella Child, Thomas Hale Child and Miss Mary P.\r\n  Hale, relatives of Sir Roger H. Sheaffe.\r\n\r\nNathaniel Sheaffe, oldest brother of Sir Roger, was a clerk in the\r\nCustom House, but at the death of his father in 1771, he left, in order\r\nto better provide for his mother and sisters, of whom he had the care.\r\nAt the outbreak of the Revolution, he went to Jamaica, \"where he\r\nintended to stay till the times will permit him to come home.\" He died\r\nJanuary 29, 1777, and was buried in the churchyard at Morant Bay,\r\nJamaica.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS CHILD SHEAFFE, brother of Sir Roger, went to New York after the\r\nevacuation of Boston. He was engaged in trade with the West Indies and\r\nSouther Ports. He died in Boston previous to 1793.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       JONATHAN SAYWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name Saward or Sayward is an ancient Teutonic personal name, sae,\r\nthe sea and weard, a keeper--the Guardian of the Sea, and was applied to\r\nthe high admiral in Saxon times.\r\n\r\nHenry Sayward came over to this country from England in 1637. He resided\r\na few years at Hampton and Portsmouth, and then came to York. He was by\r\noccupation a millwright and carpenter, a man much needed, as mills were\r\nthe principal sources of income to the new settlers. The town of York\r\ngranted him three hundred acres of upland on the west side of the York\r\nriver, and the selectmen laid the same out to him June 20th, 1667. Here\r\nhe settled, and built a saw mill, and carried on a large business. He\r\nalso at this time built the meeting house at York. He was constable of\r\nYork in 1664, Selectman in 1667, Grand Juryman in 1668-9. His wife's\r\nname was Mary, and it has been claimed she was the daughter of John\r\nCousins, of Casco Bay. He died in 1679. There is no record of the birth\r\nof their children, as the records of the Town of York were destroyed by\r\nthe Indians on Feb. 5, 1692, but there is a deposition and deeds, which\r\nprove they had three sons and three daughters.\r\n\r\nJONATHAN SAYWARD, the second son of Henry and Mary Sayward, resided in\r\nYork. Very little is known concerning him. In 1687 there was a grant of\r\nland made to him by the town, on Little River, near Wells. He died\r\nprevious to 1699.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH SAYWARD, son of the aforesaid, was born at York, March 17, 1702.\r\nHe was constable in 1716. Moderator and Selectman in 1721. At this date\r\nthe meeting voted \"that Mr. Joseph Sayward shall have the full\r\nmanagement to build a sufficient fortification about our Parsonage home,\r\nof ten foot high, and fifty foot square, with two good buskins, or\r\nflancers, of ten foot square, all to be built of square hard timber, of\r\nten inches thick, to be built forthwith, and said Sayward to keep a just\r\nand full account of ye cost and charge thereof.\" In 1723 the Indians\r\nwere troublesome. A company under Captain Bragdon was sent in pursuit of\r\nthem, a journal of their proceedings was kept by Joseph Sayward, which\r\nis in the Mass. Archives.\r\n\r\nHe married Mary, daughter of Samuel and Deborah Webber, of York, and had\r\nfive sons and four daughters.\r\n\r\nJONATHAN SAYWARD, eldest son of the aforesaid Joseph, and of the fourth\r\ngeneration in this country, and the subject of this sketch, was born at\r\nYork, November 9, 1713. He began to take an interest in public affairs\r\nearly in life. He was chosen town clerk in 1736, and constable in 1741.\r\nHe was commissioned by Governor Shirley to command the sloop \"Sea\r\nFlower\" in the expedition against Louisburg in 1744, in which he took an\r\nimportant part.\r\n\r\nHe was chosen Representative to the General Court of Massachusetts for\r\nthe years 1766, 7, 8.\r\n\r\nIn 1772 he was appointed by Governor Hutchinson as Special Justice of\r\nthe Court of Common Pleas, and Judge of Probate for York County.\r\n\r\nHe was for many years extensively engaged in shipping, and at one time\r\nowned about twenty vessels, which were employed in the Southern and West\r\nIndia trade. He was one of the most extensive land owners in York, and\r\nwas one of the proprietors of the town of Shapleigh.\r\n\r\nWhen the Revolution broke out he was living in affluence in the\r\nbeautiful mansion which he had built on the York river, near the mill\r\nsite granted to his ancestors. At this time he had several vessels with\r\nvaluable cargoes in the West Indies, and large sums of money invested in\r\npersonal securities, on the income of which he enjoyed a satisfactory\r\nand honorable independence, but all was swept away in the Revolution.\r\n\r\nJudge Sayward was one of the seventeen \"Rescinders.\" He was not only\r\ndecided in his attachment to the Crown, but was of the opinion that the\r\nRevolution would cause the decline of national virtue and prosperity in\r\nAmerica. He fared hard at the hands of the \"Sons of Liberty,\" and by\r\nremaining was obliged to bear contempt and insult, and by his own\r\naccount never went out without L100 in his pocket, so as to be ever\r\nready to escape from his persecutors. But, however bad he was treated in\r\nthe early days of the great struggle, he seems to have regained the\r\nconfidence of his townsmen, for in 1780 he was elected Moderator of the\r\ntown meeting, and auditor of selectmen accounts in 1782.\r\n\r\nHis mansion home previously referred to is among the most interesting of\r\nthe many historic homes in the ancient town of York, and what makes it\r\ndoubly so is the fact that it contains all the original furniture,\r\nbooks, painting, silver plate, and the \"loote\" he obtained at the\r\ncapture of Louisburg and brought home with him, consisting of rare\r\nchinaware, two very large candlesticks, a pair of andirons, a warming\r\npan and brass tongs, all of which are now in a good state of\r\npreservation. There is also a full length portrait of Judge Sayward and\r\nanother of his wife, with costumes of their times, and one of his\r\ndaughter Sarah, at the age of twenty-three, painted by Blackburn at\r\nCharleston in 1761, a pupil of Copley. As works of art these paintings\r\nare pronounced by connoisseurs as exceedingly fine. The family coat of\r\narms of the Saywards, in color, occupies a conspicuous place over the\r\nmantel piece, on the back of which is the following memorandum, which\r\nproves conclusively that it was legally granted:\r\n\r\n                                              London, July 1st, 1762.\r\n\r\n     The arms of Jonathan Sayward, Esqr., of Old York, in the Province\r\n     of the Massachusetts Bay, in New England, Merchant, Rec'd this 1st\r\n     of July, 1762, from the College of Arms, Herald's Office.

Barrell.\r\n\r\nThere is also a commission from Governor Shirley to Jonathan Sayward, to\r\ncommand the sloop \"Sea Flower\" in the Louisburg expedition. The mansion\r\nis full of articles worth the attention of those of historical,\r\nantiquarian taste. Judge Sayward died May 8, 1797, and is buried in the\r\nold burying ground in York Village.\r\n\r\nHe married in 1736 Sarah Mitchell, who died in 1775. They had only one\r\nchild, Sarah, born 1738, who married Nathaniel Barrell of Portsmouth,\r\nmerchant. They were married at the judge's mansion in 1758. She was a\r\ngreat belle in her time, and was the general favorite of the village.\r\nShe died in 1808, and her husband in 1831, aged 99 years. They had\r\neleven children.\r\n\r\nThe mansion was for many years owned and occupied by Elizabeth and Mary\r\nBarrell, daughters of Jonathan Sayward Barrell, granddaughters of the\r\nJudge. They took great pleasure in exhibiting the house and the many\r\ninteresting relics and heirlooms of their grandfather, and it is largely\r\ndue to them that the same was kept intact, and not distributed at their\r\ndeath, as many members of the family desired. Elizabeth died in the old\r\nmansion November 12, 1883, aged 84 years, and her sister Mary died at\r\nthe same place, June 6, 1889, aged 85 years.[262]\r\n\r\n  [262] The Sayward Family, 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             DEBLOIS FAMILY.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIENNE DEBLOIS was born in France, and for a time lived in Belgium. He\r\nwas a French Huguenot, and the family name was DeChatillon. He was\r\ndescended from the last counts of Blois and was banished from France at\r\nthe revocation of the Edict of Nantes. After living in the Low\r\nCountries, he removed to England and was present at the battle of the\r\nBoyne. His sister was burnt at the stake in Ireland by the Papists, and\r\nhe died in England.\r\n\r\nStephen Deblois, son of Etienne, was born in Oxford, England, in 1699.\r\nHe came to New York in the Frigate Sea Horse, commanded by Captain\r\nDumaresq. In 1720 he removed to Boston. He married February 6, 1721, Ann\r\nFarley, of English parentage. His death occurred in Boston in 1785, and\r\nhis large estate was settled in 1790. In his will he says: \"My two sons\r\nhas been obliged to leave and I do not expect to see them again.\"\r\n\r\nGILBERT DEBLOIS, son of the latter was born in New York city, March 17,\r\n1725. He became a prosperous Merchant in Boston. In 1749 he married Ann,\r\ndaughter of William and Ann Holmes Coffin, and granddaughter of\r\nNathaniel Coffin. In 1774 Gilbert Deblois was an Addresser of\r\nHutchinson, and in 1775 an Addresser of Gage. In 1776 he went to Halifax\r\nwith his younger brother Lewis, and then must have returned to New York\r\nbefore his departure for England, according to an account in\r\nHutchinson's Diary.\r\n\r\nDec. 23, 1776--Gilbert Deblois arrived in one of the transports from New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nWhile residing in Boston, Mr. Deblois planted some elms in front of the\r\nGranary, just opposite his house on Tremont Street. These famous trees\r\nafterwards became known as the Paddock elms. Mr. Deblois had asked\r\nPaddock to keep an eye to their safety, and Adino Paddock performed this\r\nduty faithfully.\r\n\r\nIn a letter written by James Murray to a friend in New York, dated\r\nSeptember 30, 1769, he speaks of Mr. Deblois' assistance to him when he\r\nwas attacked by a mob. \"Mr. Deblois threw himself in my rear, and\r\nsuffered not a little in my defence.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1778 Gilbert Deblois was proscribed and banished, and his estate\r\nconfiscated. The year following he was in London and addressed the king.\r\nHis death occurred in that city in 1792, aged sixty-seven.\r\n\r\nLEWIS DEBLOIS, brother to Gilbert, married Elizabeth Jenkins of Boston,\r\nin 1748. He was a prominent merchant in Boston, was an Addresser of\r\nGeneral Gage in 1775. He went to Halifax on the evacuation of Boston in\r\n1776.\r\n\r\nHe was proscribed and banished. He died very suddenly in England, (after\r\nbeing out all day) in 1779, aged seventy-one.\r\n\r\nGeorge Deblois, son of the aforesaid was born in Boston in 1753. He was\r\na merchant in Salem. He was an Addresser of General Gage in 1774. He\r\nwent to England. In 1784, there was a George Deblois, a merchant at\r\nHalifax, N. S., probably his son. The widow of a George Deblois died in\r\nthe same city in 1827, aged seventy-four.\r\n\r\nLEWIS DEBLOIS, brother of the aforesaid, was born in Boston in 1762. He\r\nwent to New Brunswick and was a prominent merchant in St. John, and in\r\n1795 a member of the company of Loyal Artillery. He died in that city in\r\n1802.

He married Mary,\r\ndaughter of Peter and Elizabeth Bowdoin in 1708. He was in 1748 the only\r\nsurviving elder of the French Church on School street, Boston, of which\r\nAndrew Le Mercier was minister.[263] His son James Boutineau was born 27\r\nJanuary, 1710, he was an Attorney-at-law. In 1774 he was appointed\r\nMandamus-Counsellor, and was one of the ten who took the oath of office.\r\nHis daughter Nancy was married on Oct. 5, 1769, to John Robinson, a\r\ncommissioner of the customs, but previous to this marriage Robinson was\r\naccused of assault upon James Otis, the latter, one of the most\r\nformidable of the \"Patriots\" met Commissioner Robinson at the\r\nCoffee-house and trouble ensued. As usual in all such cases, the friends\r\nof each party made out a good case for their respective sides, the\r\nmatter was carried into court, where it was kept for about four years\r\nand the jury finally brought in damages in favor of Otis. In the\r\nmeantime Robinson and his wife had gone to England, and as Mr. Boutineau\r\nwas a lawyer, he managed the case for his son-in-law, who apologized for\r\ninjuring Otis. Mr. Otis refused the fine of 2,000 pounds sterling, and\r\nnothing was demanded of Robinson but the costs of court and the amount\r\nof Mr. Otis' surgeon's bill, altogether amounting to about 112 pounds,\r\nlawful money.

Simon Browne, Barrister, resided\r\nthere in 1540, and removed to Brundish, Suffolk. His son Thomas died\r\nthere in 1608, and his son Francis died there in 1626. His son Hon.\r\nWilliam, born 1608, came to Salem in 1635, became a merchant in Salem,\r\nand was eminent for his exemplary life, and public charities. He died in\r\n1687. Major William Browne, son of the preceding, was born in 1639. He\r\nwas a Councillor and Judge of the Court of Common Pleas for Essex\r\nCounty. He was a successful merchant, and a man of great influence in\r\nthe Colony. He married Hannah, daughter of Captain George Curwin. He\r\ndied in 1716, at the age of seventy-eight.\r\n\r\nCOLONEL SAMUEL BROWNE, son of the aforesaid, was born in 1669. He was\r\nthe first town Treasurer of Salem, was many years a Representative,\r\nJudge of the Court of Common Pleas for Essex County, was also Chief\r\nJustice of said Court, also Colonel and Councillor. He was said to be by\r\nfar the greatest merchant in his day, in the County of Essex. He\r\nemulated the beneficence of his father, uncle, and grandfather, in\r\nbequeathing large sums to Harvard College, and to schools in Salem. He\r\ndied in 1731, aged 62. His son Samuel graduated at Harvard College,\r\n1727. He married a daughter of John Winthrop, F. R. S., of New London,\r\nConn., and died in 1742, aged 34. He was concerned in mercantile\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nCOLONEL WILLIAM BROWNE, son of the aforesaid Samuel, was born at Salem\r\nin 1737, was a grandson of Governor Burnet. He graduated at Harvard\r\nCollege in 1755, the third in his class. He married his cousin, a\r\ndaughter of Governor Wanton of Rhode Island, and was doubly connected\r\nwith the Winthrop family, the wives of the elder Browne and Governor\r\nWanton being daughters of John Winthrop, F. R. S., great-grandson of\r\nthe first governor of Massachusetts. William Browne was Colonel of the\r\nEssex regiment, a member of the General Court in 1768, was one of the\r\nseventeen Rescinders, Judge of the Supreme Court, one of the ten\r\nMandamus Counsellors who was sworn in. Colonel Browne was esteemed among\r\nthe most opulent and benevolent individuals of the province before the\r\nRevolution, and so great was his popularity that the gubernatorial chair\r\nwas offered him by the \"Committee of Safety\" as an inducement for him to\r\nremain and join the \"Sons of Liberty.\" But he felt it his duty to remain\r\non the side of the government, which represented law and authority, even\r\nat the expense of his great landed estates, both in Massachusetts and\r\nConnecticut, in the latter there were fourteen valuable farms, all of\r\nwhich were afterwards confiscated. After the passage of the Boston Port\r\nBill, he was waited upon by a committee of the Essex delegates, which\r\nconsisted of Jeremiah Lee, Samuel Holton, and Elbridge Gerry. They\r\ninformed him that \"It was with grief that the country had viewed his\r\nexertions for carrying into execution certain acts of parliament,\r\ncalculated to enslave, and ruin his native land, that while the country\r\nwould continue the respect for several years paid him, it resolved to\r\ndetach every future connection all such, as shall persist in supporting\r\nor in any countenancing the late arbitrary acts of Parliament; that the\r\ndelegates in the name of the country, request him to excuse them from\r\nthe painful necessity of considering, and treating him as an enemy to\r\nhis country, unless he resigned his office as counsellor and judge.\"\r\nColonel Browne replied as follows: \"As a Judge, and in every other\r\ncapacity, I intend to act with honor, and integrity, and to exert my\r\nbest abilities, and be assured, that neither persuasion can allure me,\r\nnor menaces compel me, to do anything derogatory to the character of a\r\nCounsellor of his majesty's province of Massachusetts. I cannot consent\r\nto defeat his Majesty's intentions, and disappoint his expectations by\r\nabandoning a post to which he has been graciously pleased to appoint\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nHe was an Addresser of General Gage, was included in the Banishment Act\r\nof 1778, and in the Conspiracy Act of the year following. He was in\r\nLondon as early as May 4, 1776, and gave his fellow exiles some\r\nparticulars relative to the evacuation of Boston. His wife, who\r\ncomplained of her treatment at Salem, and Boston, after his departure,\r\ndoes not appear to have joined him in England until the spring of 1778.\r\nIn 1781 he was appointed Governor of the Bermudas, and administered the\r\naffairs of these islands in a manner to secure the confidence of the\r\npeople. Under his judicious management the colony flourished. He found\r\nthe financial affairs of the islands in a confused and ruinous state,\r\nand left them flourishing. In 1788 he left for England, deeply and\r\nsincerely regretted by the people. He died in England, February, 1802,\r\naged sixty-five.\r\n\r\nWilliam Browne, son of the aforesaid, born at Salem, was an officer in\r\nthe British Army, and was at the siege of Gibraltar. He was in England\r\nin 1784.\r\n\r\nColonel Benjamin Pickman, writing in 1793, said of the Brownes: \"I would\r\nobserve that the family of the Brownes has been the most remarkable\r\nfamily that has ever lived in the Town of Salem, holding places of the\r\nhighest trust in the Town, County, and State, and possessing great\r\nriches. Their donations to the schools have been considerable, and their\r\nmercantile engagements have very much contributed to the growth of the\r\nTown.\"\r\n\r\nThe Browne mansion, erected by William Browne in 1740, upon the summit\r\nof Browne's Hill. He named \"Browne Hall\" after a place in Lancashire,\r\nEngland, that belonged to his ancestors.\r\n\r\nThe building consisted of two wings, two stories high, connected by a\r\nspacious hall, the whole presenting 80 feet front. The dwelling was one\r\nof the most magnificent in the Colony, it was finished in a most\r\nthorough and costly manner, corresponding with the wealth of the owner.\r\nThe house was confiscated and later came into the possession of Hon.\r\nWilliam Gray, who resided there till 1800. Subsequently it was known as\r\n\"Sun Tavern,\" and then taken down.[264]\r\n\r\n  [264] Essex Inst. His. Coll. Vol. xxxii., pp. 201-238.

He was high in\r\noffice among the Free Masons. In 1776 he went to New York and on account\r\nof his loyalty was proscribed and banished in 1778.\r\n\r\nAt the peace he went from New York to Shelburne, Nova Scotia,\r\naccompanied by his family of six persons and one servant. In Nova Scotia\r\nhe was Clerk of the Peace, and Register of Probate. On account of\r\nadhering to the royal cause his losses were estimated at L1100. As he\r\nwas a man of learning, a reader, and of an observant nature, he left\r\nmany valuable papers. His death occurred in 1820.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CAPTAIN JOHN MALCOMB.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is not much known of this person. I find that he lived at\r\nBrunswick, Maine, and that in 1760 he married Abigail Trundy, of\r\nFalmouth (Portland). He was commissioned Ensign by Governor Shirley, and\r\nserved under Colonel Waldo, in the 2nd Massachusetts Regiment against\r\nLouisburg in 1745. He was also Captain of a vessel that took despatches\r\nfrom there to Boston in the same year.\r\n\r\nIt was not often that the same man was tarred and feathered mere than\r\nonce, but this unhappy experience twice befell John Malcom. His offence\r\nappears to have been in the exercise of his duty as custom house\r\nofficer, of seizing a vessel at Falmouth, now Portland, for want of a\r\nregister, and freely speaking of the actions of the \"Sons of Liberty.\"\r\nWe are informed by the papers of that period[265] \"That John Malcom was\r\ngenteely Tarr'd and Feathered at Pownalborough\" (now Dresden, Maine) \"on\r\nNovember first, 1773, and on January 25th, 1774, a mob in Boston tore\r\nhis cloaths off, and tarr'd his Head and Body, and feathered him, then\r\nthey set him on a chair in a cart, and carried him through the main\r\nStreet into King Street, from thence they proceeded to 'Liberty Tree,'\r\nand then to the Neck, as far as the Gallows, where they whipped, beat\r\nhim with Sticks, and threatened to hang him.\"\r\n\r\n  [265] Boston Gazette, Nov. 15, 1773. Boston News Letter, Jan. 27, 1774.\r\n  Feb 3, 1774. Massachusetts Spy, Jan. 27, 1774.\r\n\r\nThe \"Sons of Despotism\" detained him under the gallows for an hour. He\r\nwas then conveyed to the north end of the town, and thence back to his\r\nhouse. He was kept stripped four hours, and was so bruised and benumbed\r\nby the cold that his life was despaired of. It was by such means that\r\nthe disunionists made converts to their cause. His offence for this\r\nBoston outrage, was that he struck one of his tormentors, a tradesman\r\nwho had frequently insulted him, when a warrant was issued against him,\r\nbut as the constable had not been able to find him, a mob gathered about\r\nhis house and broke his windows. Malcomb was in the house, and pushing\r\nhis sword through a broken window, wounded one of his assailants. The\r\nmob then made a rush, broke in, and finding him in a chamber, lowered\r\nhim by a rope into the cart, and treated him as before mentioned in the\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE RUSSELL FAMILY OF CHARLESTOWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Russell family was eminent in social station and distinguished in\r\nthe many public offices held by them in Boston and Charlestown for\r\nnearly two centuries. The first of this family to come to this country\r\nwas the Hon. Richard Russell, son of Paul, of Hereford, England, born\r\n1611, was an apprentice at Bristol, 1628, arrived here in 1640 with his\r\nwife, both admitted to the church in 1641, was a prominent merchant,\r\nRepresentative, Councillor, Speaker, Treasurer, Assistant. He died in\r\n1676, aged 63. His son James, born 1640, died 1709. He also was judge,\r\nCouncillor and Treasurer, etc. He had an only son Daniel, born 1683,\r\ndied 1763. He married Rebecca Chambers, and was also Councillor,\r\nCommissioner, Treasurer, etc.\r\n\r\nCHAMBERS RUSSELL, son of the preceding, was born 1713. He was Judge,\r\nCouncillor and a prominent lawyer, in whose office John Adams and Judge\r\nSewall studied law. He graduated at Harvard College 1731, married Mary\r\nWainwright, resided at Lincoln, which was incorporated in 1754, and\r\nnamed by him, after Lincoln in England, where some of his ancestors\r\nresided. His wife died in 1762, and he went to England, and died Nov.\r\n24, 1767, at Guilford County, Surrey.\r\n\r\nJAMES RUSSELL, brother of Chambers, married Catherine Greaves, 1738. He\r\nwas Judge, Representative, and in 1774 was appointed Mandamus\r\nCouncillor, but did not take the official oath. This saved him from the\r\nwrath of the revolutionists. He was not solicitous to shine, but was\r\nanxious to do good, and to be on friendly terms with his neighbors. He\r\nwas incessant in his endeavors to promote the happiness and advance the\r\nprosperity of the community in which he lived. A bridge from Charlestown\r\nto Boston was among the enterprises which he projected. By his\r\npersevering efforts, the work was accomplished, and the Charlestown\r\nBridge was the first structure of the kind ever build across a broad\r\nriver in the United States. Through his great benevolence, and public\r\nspirit, he was not driven from his home as his sons were, the\r\nrevolutionists allowed him to remain, and he died at Charlestown, Sept.\r\n17th, 1798, aged 83 years.\r\n\r\nJAMES RUSSELL, JR., son of the preceding, was obliged to leave and go to\r\nEngland. Was in London, February 1776, and at Exeter in 1779. A year\r\nlater the fortunate captures made by a privateer gave him a fortune, and\r\nhe was \"bound in the matrimonial chain\" to Mary, second daughter of\r\nRichard Lechmere, a Boston Loyalist. They were married in 1780 at St.\r\nPeter's Church, Bristol, where he resided as a merchant. Among their\r\nchildren was Lechmere-Coor-Graves, Charles James, who died in service of\r\nRoyal Navy, Katherine-Sarah, who married Major Miller of Bombay\r\nArtillery, Lucy Margaret, married Rev. Robert Cope Wolf.\r\n\r\nDR. CHARLES RUSSELL, brother of James, was also a staunch loyalist.\r\nGraduated at Harvard College 1757. Married Feb. 15, 1768, Elizabeth,\r\nonly daughter of Colonel Henry Vassell of Cambridge. He succeeded to his\r\nuncle, Judge Chambers Russell's estate at Lincoln, was proscribed and\r\nbanished, and his estate confiscated. He was a physician at Antigua,\r\nwhere his wife owned considerable property. He died there in 1780, and\r\nhis wife died at Plymouth in 1802.[266]\r\n\r\n  [266] Wyman Genealogies and Estates in Charlestown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                EZEKIEL RUSSELL\r\n\r\n\r\nWas a Printer and born in Boston, he served an apprenticeship with his\r\nbrother Joseph. This family had no connection with the Charlestown\r\nRussells. In November, 1771, he commenced a political publication called\r\n\"The Censor.\" It was printed in Marlboro Street, was a weekly\r\npublication, designed to defend the action of the government, and was\r\nsupported by the loyalists. The articles were written with great\r\nability by Lieut. Gov. Oliver, Dr. Benjamin Church, and other\r\nloyalists. The first number reprinted from the Massachusetts Spy, the\r\nthen famous letter of Joseph Greenleaf attacking Governor Hutchinson,\r\nand answered it with vehemence and spirit. In succeeding numbers the\r\ncontroversy was prolonged with increasing bitterness, and at last became\r\nintensely personal. The issue of Feb. 8, 1772, contained a recipe to\r\nmake a modern patriot for the Colonies, especially for Massachusetts, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"Take of impudence, virulence and groundless abuse =quantum\r\n     sufficit=, atheism, deism and libitinism =ad libitum=; false\r\n     reports, well adapted and plausable lies, with groundless alarms,\r\n     =one hundred wt. avoirdupois=; a malignant abuse of magistracy, a\r\n     pusilanimous and diabolical contempt of divine revelation and all\r\n     its abbettors, =an equal quantity=; honor and integrity not quite\r\n     =an atom=; fraud, imposition, and hypocrisy, any proportion that\r\n     may seem expedient; infuse therein the credulity of the people =one\r\n     thousand gallons=, as a =menstrum= stir in the =phrenzy= of the\r\n     =times=, and at the end of a year or two this judicious composition\r\n     will probably bring forth a A =***= and Y =***= an O =***= and a M\r\n     =*****=.\"\r\n\r\n                                                    \"Probatum est I. N.\"\r\n\r\nThe Censor not proving a success, Mr. Russell attempted to establish a\r\nnewspaper at Salem, but that also failed. He returned to Boston, where\r\nhe obtained support principally by printing and selling ballads, and\r\nsmall pamphlets. His wife was an active and industrious woman, who not\r\nonly assisted him in printing, but sometimes wrote ballads on recent\r\ntragical events, which were published, and had frequently a considerable\r\nrun. Ezekiel Russell died September 1796, aged fifty-two years. Joseph\r\nRussell, brother of Ezekiel, son of Benjamin and Elizabeth Russell, was\r\nborn at Boston, 8 September, 1734, and died at St. John, New Brunswick,\r\nin 1808, aged 74 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          JONATHAN SEWALL.\r\n\r\n                   ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe family of Sewall is traced to two brothers, Henry, and William\r\nSewall, both Mayors of Coventry, England, Henry Sewall born about 1544,\r\nwas a Linen Draper, Alderman of Coventry, Mayor in 1589 and 1606. Died\r\n1628, aged 84. Buried in St. Michael's Church, Coventry. Married\r\nMargaret, eldest daughter of Avery Grazebrook.\r\n\r\nTheir son Henry Sewall, emigrated to New England in 1634. He came over\r\n\"out of dislike to the English Hierarchy\" and settled at Newbury. He\r\ndied at Rowley in 1657, aged 81 years. Married Anne Hunt. They brought\r\nwith them their son, Henry Sewall, born in Coventry, in 1614, died in\r\n1700, aged 86. Married Jane Dummer in Newbury, 1646. He went back to\r\nEngland and resided for some years at Warwick. In 1659 he returned to\r\nNew England, \"his rents at Newbury coming to very little when remitted\r\nto England.\" His son Stephen was born at Badesly, England in 1657. He\r\ncame to New England in 1661, settled at Salem and was a Major in the\r\nIndian wars. He died in 1725. Married Margaret, daughter of Rev.\r\nJonathan Mitchell of Cambridge in 1682. They had an only son Jonathan,\r\nwho was a merchant at Boston. He married Mary, sister of Edward Payne,\r\nof Boston. They had a son,\r\n\r\nJUDGE JONATHAN SEWALL, the subject of this notice. He was born at Boston\r\nin 1728. Graduated at Harvard College in 1748, and was a teacher at\r\nSalem till 1756. He married Esther, daughter of Edmund Quincy, Esq., of\r\nBraintree, afterwards of Boston, and sister of Dorothy Quincy, wife of\r\nGovernor Hancock, and of Elizabeth Quincy, wife of Samuel Sewall, of\r\nBoston, the father of Samuel Sewall, Chief Justice of Massachusetts.\r\nJonathan Sewall studied law with Judge Chambers Russell, of Lincoln,\r\ncommenced practice in his profession at Charlestown. He was an able and\r\nsuccessful lawyer. He was Solicitor General, and his eloquence is\r\nrepresented as having been soft, smooth and insinuating, which gave him\r\nas much power over a jury as a lawyer ought ever to possess. At the\r\ndeath of Jeremy Gridley, he was appointed Attorney-General of\r\nMassachusetts, September, 1767. In 1768 he was appointed Judge of\r\nAdmiralty for Nova Scotia. He went there twice in that capacity, and\r\nremained but a short period.\r\n\r\nHe was a gentleman and a scholar. He possessed a lively wit, a brilliant\r\nimagination, great subtlety of reasoning and an insinuating eloquence.\r\n\r\nHe was an intimate friend of John Adams, they studied together in Judge\r\nRussell's office, and afterwards, while attending court, they lived\r\ntogether, frequently slept in the same chamber, and often in the same\r\nbed, and besides the two young men were in constant correspondence.\r\n\r\nHe attempted to dissuade John Adams from attending the first Continental\r\nCongress, and it was in reply to his arguments, and as they walked on\r\nthe Great Hill at Portland, that Adams used the memorable words, used so\r\noften afterwards in 1861 when the ordinance of secession was passed:\r\n\"The die is now cast, I have now passed the Rubicon; sink or swim, live\r\nor die, survive or perish with my country, is my unalterable\r\ndetermination.\" They parted, and met no more until 1788. Adams, the\r\nMinister of the new republic at the Court of St. James, and the eloquent\r\nand gifted Sewall, true to the Empire, met in London. Adams laying aside\r\nall etiquette made a visit to his old friend and countryman, he said, \"I\r\nordered my servant to announce John Adams, I was instantly admitted, and\r\nboth of us forgetting that we had ever been enemies, embraced each other\r\nas cordially as ever. I had two hours conversation with him in a most\r\ndelightful freedom, upon a multitude of subjects.\" In the course of the\r\ninterview, Mr. Sewall remarked that he had existed for the sake of his\r\ntwo children, that he had spared no pains or expense in their education\r\nand that he was going to Nova Scotia in hope of making some provision\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nIn 1774, he was an Addresser of Governor Hutchinson, and in September of\r\nthat year his elegant home in Cambridge (which he rented from John\r\nVassal, afterwards Washington's head-quarters, since occupied by the\r\npoet Longfellow) was attacked by the mob and much injured. He fled to\r\nBoston to escape from the fury of the disunionists. He had ably\r\nvindicated the characters of Governors Bernard, Hutchinson and Oliver,\r\nhe was esteemed an able writer, and a staunch loyalist. He was\r\nproscribed in the Conspirators Act of 1779. He resided chiefly in\r\nBristol till 1788, for the education of his children, then he removed to\r\nSt. John's, N. B., having been appointed Judge of Admiralty for Nova\r\nScotia and New Brunswick. He immediately entered upon the duties of his\r\noffice, which he held till his death, which occurred September 26, 1796,\r\nat the age of sixty-eight. His widow survived him, and removed to\r\nMontreal, where she died January 21, 1810.\r\n\r\nJONATHAN SEWALL, son of the aforesaid, was born at Cambridge, 1766, was\r\neducated at Bristol, England, and afterwards resided at Quebec, where he\r\noccupied the offices of Solicitor and Attorney General and Judge of the\r\nVice Admiralty Court, until 1808, when he was appointed Chief Justice of\r\nLower Canada, which he resigned in 1838. For many years he was President\r\nof the Executive Council, and Speaker of the Legislative Council.\r\n\r\nIn 1832 he received the degree of Doctor of Law from Harvard College. He\r\ndied at Quebec in 1840, aged seventy-three. His brother Stephen was\r\nSolicitor General of the same Province in 1810 and resided in Montreal.\r\nHe died there of Asiatic cholera in the summer of 1832.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL SEWALL son of Henry Sewall and brother of Major Stephen Sewall,\r\nwas the first chief justice of Massachusetts. This was the famous Sewall\r\nthat sat in judgment upon the witches and afterwards repented it, who\r\nrefused to sell an inch of his broad acres to the hated Episcopalians to\r\nbuild a church upon, who was one of the richest, most astute, sagacious,\r\nscholarly, bigoted and influential men of his day, who has left us in\r\nhis Diary a transcript almost vivid in its conscientious faithfulness of\r\nthat old time life, where he tells us of the courts he held, the drams\r\nhe drank, the sermons he heard, the petty affairs of his own household\r\nand neighborhood, and where he advised with the governor touching\r\nmatters of life and death. He married Hannah, the only child of John\r\nHull, the mintmaster, who it is said gave her, on her marriage, a\r\nsettlement in pine tree shillings equal to her weight. Hull owned a\r\nlarge farm of 350 acres in Longwood, Brookline, which descended to his\r\nson-in-law, and was known afterwards as Sewall's Farm.[267]\r\n\r\n  [267] Curwen Journal, pp. 463-5. 506. Sabine's Loyalists, pp, 265-8.\r\n\r\nSamuel Sewall, son of the aforesaid, married Rebecca Dudley, a daughter\r\nof the governor. His son, Henry Sewall, born in 1719, died in 1771, was\r\na gentleman much respected, and a lawyer of prominence. His son,\r\n\r\nSAMUEL SEWALL, the subject of this article, was born at Brookline,\r\nDecember 31, 1745. Graduated at Harvard College in 1761. He studied law\r\nand settled in Boston. His name occurs among the barristers and\r\nattorneys who addressed Governor Hutchinson in 1774, and in the\r\nBanishment and Proscription Act in 1778, when his large estate which he\r\nhad inherited from his ancestors, was confiscated. He went to England,\r\nand in 1776 was a member of the Loyalist Club, London. Two years later\r\nhe was at Sidmouth, a \"bathing town of mud walls and thatched roofs.\" In\r\n1780 he was living in Bristol, and on the 19th of June amused himself\r\nloyally celebrating Clinton's success at Charleston in the discharge of\r\na two-pounder in a private garden, and three days later was shot at by a\r\nhighwayman and narrowly escaped with his life. Early in 1782 he was at\r\nTaunton, and at Sidmouth. He died at London, after one day's confinement\r\nto his room, May 6th, 1811, aged fifty-six years. He was unmarried.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LIST OF CONFISCATED ESTATES BELONGING TO SAMUEL SEWALL IN SUFFOLK COUNTY\r\n                             AND TO WHOM SOLD.\r\n\r\n     To Edward Kitchen, Wolcott, July 19, 1782; Lib. 135, fol. 113; Land\r\n       263 A. 1 qr., in Brookline, Thomas Aspinwall E.; marsh road to\r\n       Charles River N E.; Charles River N.; Thomas Gardner and Moses\r\n       Griggs S. and S.W.; Solomon Hill S. and S.E.----Land, 16 A. 3 qr.,\r\n       and half of house in Brookline on Sherburn Road and the marsh lane,\r\n       bounded by Capt.

He graduated\r\nat Harvard College in 1708, and died in 1729. He was tutor, librarian,\r\nand Fellow of the college. He published an account of a remarkable\r\neclipse of the sun on Nov. 27, 1772, also in the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_ of the Royal Society, papers on the Alkaline Salts, and\r\nthe Venom of Spiders (1720-24). The following extract from the diary of\r\nPresident Leverett shows the estimation in which he was held. \"It ought\r\nto be remembered that Mr. Robie was no small honor to Harvard College by\r\nhis mathematical performances, and by his correspondence thereupon with\r\nMr. Durham and other learned persons in those studies abroad.\" In\r\nmathematics and natural philosophy he was said to have no equal in New\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nHis mother was Elizabeth Taylor, daughter of James Taylor, long\r\ntreasurer of the Province.[268] He went to Salem and established himself\r\nin the practice of physic, and married a daughter of Major Stephen\r\nSewall.\r\n\r\n  [268] Memorial His., of Boston. Vol. iv. p. 492. Vol. ii. p. 549.\r\n\r\nThomas Robie, of Marblehead, was a son of the preceding Dr. Robie. He\r\nwas a merchant, and married a daughter of the Rev. Simon Bradstreet, who\r\nwas the great grandson of Gov. Bradstreet, called the Nestor of New\r\nEngland. Mr. Robie was a staunch loyalist, was an Addresser of Gov.\r\nHutchinson, and thus brought upon himself and family the ire of the\r\nRevolutionists. They were obliged to leave the town and take refuge in\r\nNova Scotia. Crowds of people collected on the wharf to witness their\r\ndeparture, and many irritating and insulting remarks were addressed to\r\nthem concerning their Tory principles, and their conduct towards the\r\nWhigs. Provoked beyond endurance by these insulting taunts, Mrs. Robie\r\nretorted, as she seated herself in the boat that was to convey her to\r\nthe ship: \"I hope that I shall live to return, find this wicked\r\nrebellion crushed and see the streets of Marblehead run with rebel\r\nblood.\" The effect of this remark was electrical among the\r\nRevolutionists and only her sex prevented them from doing her person\r\ninjury. But there were other loyalists in Marblehead who, if not so\r\ndemonstrative, were not less sincere in this opinion. With fortitude and\r\nsilence they bore the taunts and insults to which they were subjected,\r\nhonestly believing that their friends and neighbors were engaged in a\r\ntreasonable rebellion against their lawful sovereign.\r\n\r\nMr. Robie first went to Halifax, but afterwards to London, Feb. 5, 1776.\r\nHe passed his time of exile mostly in Halifax, where one of his\r\ndaughters married Jonathan Stearns, Esq., another refugee; another was\r\nmarried to Joseph Sewall, Esq., late treasurer of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nAfter the war was over some of the refugees attempted to return to their\r\nformer homes. During the month of April, 1783, the town was thrown into\r\na state of the greatest excitement by the return of Stephen Blaney, one\r\nof the loyalists. Rumors were prevalent that other refugees were also\r\nabout to return, and on April 24 a town meeting was held, when it was\r\nvoted that \"All refugees who made their appearance in town were to be\r\ngiven six hours notice to leave, and any who remained beyond that time\r\nwere to be taken into custody and shipped to the nearest port of Great\r\nBritain.\" Late one afternoon after this action of the town a vessel from\r\nthe provinces arrived in the harbor. It was soon ascertained that the\r\ndetested Robie family were on board, and, as the news spread through the\r\ntown, the wharves were crowded with angry people, threatening vengeance\r\nupon them if they attempted to land. The dreadful wish uttered by Mrs.\r\nRobie at her departure still rankled in the minds of the people and they\r\ndetermined to give the Robies a significant reception. So great was the\r\nexcitement that it was feared by many of the influential citizens that\r\nthe unfortunate exiles might be injured and perhaps lose their lives at\r\nthe hands of the infuriated populace. During the night, however, a party\r\nof gentlemen went on board of the schooner and removed them to a place\r\nof safety. They were landed in a distant part of the town and secreted\r\nfor several days in a house belonging to one of the gentlemen. In the\r\nmeantime urgent appeals were made to the magnanimity of the turbulent\r\npopulace, and the excitement subsided.\r\n\r\nMr. Robie went into business again in a limited extent, and died at\r\nSalem about 1812, well esteemed and respected. The large brick mansion\r\nhouse of Thomas Robie is situated on Washington street, near the head of\r\nDarling street, Marblehead.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL BRADSTREET ROBIE, son of the above, of Halifax, was appointed\r\nsolicitor-general of Nova Scotia in 1815, speaker of the house of of\r\nassembly in 1817, 1819-20, member of the council in 1824, and master of\r\nthe rolls in 1825, and died at that city January, 1858, in his\r\neighty-eighth year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BENJAMIN MARSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin of the name Marston, is the English of Marsius (Lat.) Marson\r\n(Ger.) and signifies warrior, being derived from Mars, the god of war.\r\n\r\nJohn Marston, the first of this name to come to America came from\r\nOrmsby, Norfolk, England, to Salem, in 1637, when he was 22 years of\r\nage. He married Alice, surname unknown, on Aug. 4, 1640, and on June 2,\r\n1641 was admitted freeman. He had ten children between 1641 and 1661.\r\nHis occupation was that of carpenter. He was diligent and prosperous in\r\nhis business, and at his death bequeathed to his children \"his house and\r\nland, and some money.\" His sons were influential in town matters, and\r\nthree were chosen representatives to the general court.\r\n\r\nHe died Dec. 19, 1681, and was buried in the Old Salem Burying Ground.\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN MARSTON, the first of this name and lineage, was the fourth son\r\nof the preceding John Marston, and was born in Salem, Jan. 9, 1651. He\r\nwas an active and enterprising merchant and carried on for many years an\r\nextensive and profitable business with the West Indies, Spain, Nova\r\nScotia, and Southern Colonies. He owned two warehouses, and the wharves\r\non which they stood, several vessels, Brigantines, Ketches, Shallops and\r\nSloops. In the year 1700 he built a large and handsome brick dwelling\r\nhouse, the first brick house in Salem. It was built by George Cabot, a\r\nmason from Boston. Its location was afterwards occupied by the Lee\r\nhouse on the corner of Essex and Crombie streets. Towards the close of\r\nhis life, his estate suffered great losses, some of his vessels were\r\nlost at sea, some taken by the French and pirates, and others having\r\nlost all their crew by disease, or otherwise, \"ye voiages were spiled.\"\r\nIn June, 1719, he sailed with his son Benjamin, Jr., in \"The good\r\nBriganteen Essex\" from Salem to Ireland. His son wrote from Dublin, Nov.\r\n6, 1719, to his mother announcing \"the death of his father there, from\r\nthe Small Pox, and that he was taken ill of the same distemper, the\r\nnight he died, and that he had recovered and was not much marked.\"\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN MARSTON, the second of this name, son of the preceding Benjamin\r\nMarston, was born in Salem, Feb. 24, 1697. He graduated from Harvard\r\nCollege in 1715. It appears after the death of his father he remained in\r\nIreland, conducting all the business matters connected with the Essex,\r\nwith a degree of energy and capacity not often found in a young man of\r\n22 years of age. The voyage turned out to be much more profitable than\r\nwas expected, and much of the property that had been sold or mortgaged\r\nby his father was redeemed.\r\n\r\nHe engaged in business at Salem as a merchant and gained a reputation\r\namong his fellow townsmen as a \"man of honorable motives and strict\r\nintegrity of character.\" He was chosen representative to the general\r\ncourt in 1727-28-29. Was High Sheriff of Essex till 1737, was Justice of\r\nGeneral Session and Common Pleas Courts. In 1729 he married Elizabeth\r\nWinslow, daughter of Hon. Isaac Winslow of Marshfield. In 1740 he\r\nretired from business, and bought a large and valuable property at\r\nManchester, known for many years as the Marston farm. Here he passed the\r\nremainder of his days, and died May 22, 1754, aged 57 years, leaving a\r\nlarge estate including the Great and Little Misery Islands, for which he\r\nhad paid L516. 13.9. A part of the income of the island he left for the\r\npurpose of \"Propagating the Gospel among the Indians.\"\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN MARSTON, the third of this name, and family, and son of the\r\npreceding, was born in Salem, Sept. 30, 1730. He graduated at Harvard\r\nCollege in 1749. After leaving college he travelled in Europe and\r\nvisited some other of the British colonies. He married Sarah Sweet,\r\nwhose sister, Martha, married Col. Jeremiah Lee of Marblehead. After his\r\nmarriage he \"settled down\" in Marblehead, where for many years he\r\ncarried on a large and successful business as a merchant. He owned a\r\nstore in King street, and other stores, and warehouses, and jointly with\r\nhis partners, Jeremiah Lee and Robert Hooper, several large ships. He\r\nalso owned a pleasant and commodious dwelling house, and much real\r\nestate, and other property in Marblehead and elsewhere. He was\r\nconsidered by his friends and neighbors as a man of pure life, and great\r\nintegrity of character, active in business, energetic in public matters,\r\nhospitable and benevolent in private, a great reader and scholar, and\r\nfond of literary pursuits, always occupying one of the most respectable\r\npositions in society, and greatly esteemed by all who knew him. Here he\r\ncontinued to live for twenty years, actively engaged in business, and\r\ndoing his duty towards his town. He was chosen selectman, and overseer\r\nof the poor, thirteen times in fifteen years, fireward twelve times in\r\nfourteen years, assessor in 1760, moderator of town meetings, fourteen\r\ntimes in eight years, and occupied many other important offices of\r\ntrust. After 1768, however, when the troubles which preceded the\r\nRevolution began to increase the confidence of the people, that were\r\ninfluenced by the Revolutionists, appear to have been withheld. They\r\nstill chose him moderator of all town meetings, but he was not again\r\nappointed on any important committees. He was known to be \"an\r\nuncompromising adherent to the lawful government of the British\r\nColonies,\" but as he had violated no agreements, and never attempted to\r\ncounteract the plans of the conspirators, though frequently and openly\r\nexpressing his disapprobation of their violent proceedings, he was for\r\nsome time unmolested. At an early period, however, he discovered the\r\nstorm brewing, and as if apprehensive of future difficulties he began\r\n\"to sell off some of his property.\"\r\n\r\nBenjamin Marston was one of the Addressers of Governor Hutchinson, and\r\nthus incurred the displeasure of the Revolutionists. After this he was\r\nharshly and brutally treated by the \"Sons of Liberty.\" In the year 1775,\r\nhis home was mobbed by a Marblehead _Committee_, who without any legal\r\nauthority, entered his doors, broke open his desk, embezzled his money,\r\nand notes, and carried off his books and accounts. He made his escape\r\nfrom the town with difficulty, the turbulent \"Sons of Despotism\" would\r\nhave probably tarred and feathered him if he had come within their\r\nreach. He remained concealed among his friends for some time, till he\r\ncould reach Boston and place himself under the protection of the\r\nBritish. A letter from Hon. Wm. Brown, who also had sought shelter in\r\nBoston, to his friend Judge Curwen, a fellow Loyalist, said \"About 2\r\nmonths ago, Mr. Marston came here by night from Col. Fowle's farm. He\r\nknows nothing about Salem. His wife died last summer.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the evacuation of Boston he went to St. John, N. B., and then to\r\nWindsor, N. S., finally settling down at Halifax, and there engaging in\r\ntrade and venturing to sea, he was taken prisoner and carried into\r\nPlymouth, and remained in duress in Boston until he was exchanged, and\r\nthen went to Halifax. He returned to Boston after the peace in 1787, in\r\nthe spring of which year he visited his friends in Plymouth, for the\r\nlast time, and soon after embarked for London. His after life is best\r\ndescribed in a letter to his sister, Mrs. Elizabeth Watson, of Plymouth,\r\nwife of William Watson, Esq., under date of London, March 19, 1792. He\r\nsays: \"I now sit down and write to you with satisfaction, for I have at\r\nlength fairly waded thro the _Slough of Despond_. I am now landed on the\r\nopposite side and shall go on my way rejoicing, having once more emerged\r\ninto active life. In fact, I am engaged to go with a large Company, who\r\nare going to make a Settlement on the Island Bulama, on the coast of\r\nAfrica, as their Land Surveyor General on a pretty good lay. No\r\nexpedition could have hit my taste and humor more exactly than this one\r\npromises to do. It is so of the _Robinson Crusoe_ kind, that I prefer\r\nit, vastly to any employment of equal emolument and of a more regular\r\nkind, that might have been offered to me in this country.\r\n\r\n\"You say you have mourned me as _dead and buried_. In truth, my dear\r\nSister, I have been much worse off. I have for more than four years been\r\n_buryed alive_. As to gratifying your wish in making my native country\r\nthe residence of the remainder of my days, it is not at present in my\r\npower to do, for want of means. There is not remaining in my mind the\r\nleast resentment to the Country because the party whose side I took in\r\nthe late great Revolution, did not succeed, for I am now fully\r\nconvinced. It is better for the world that they have not. I don't mean\r\nby this to pay any complements to the first instigators of our American\r\nRevolution, although it has been of such advantage to mankind, I should\r\nas soon think of erecting monuments to Judas Iscariot, Pontius Pilate\r\nand the Jewish Sanhedrim for betraying and crucifying the Lord of Life,\r\nbecause that event was so importantly and universally beneficial.\"\r\n\r\nThe expedition to Africa resulted disastrously, and Benjamin Marston\r\ndied on the Island of Bulama of the African fever, on the 10th of\r\nAugust, 1792.\r\n\r\nFrom the scanty materials which have been here brought together, will be\r\nsufficient to convince the reader that it was no personal consideration,\r\nno expectation of honors and rewards, or desire of rank and distinction,\r\nbut simply from a deep conviction of duty, a clear sense of loyalty to\r\nthe British crown, that he gave up everything that was dear to him, his\r\n\"pleasant and spacious dwelling\" house, with its \"fine old garden for\r\nmorning exercise,\" his cherished library, his \"much property,\" his\r\nwell-earned reputation as a merchant, a magistrate and a citizen, his\r\nrelatives, friends, and native country, and become a refugee and a\r\nwanderer on the face of the earth, \"without a place that he could\r\ncommand to lay his head,\" and those that bore his name, were more proud\r\nof it than if he left rank and honor and large possessions to his\r\nrepresentatives. There were very few of those who embraced the cause of\r\nthe Mother Country, in those trying times, that were led by more\r\nhonorable, or disinterested motives, or are more deserving of\r\nremembrance than Benjamin Marston of Marblehead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       HON. BENJAMIN LYNDE CHIEF JUSTICE OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appears from the registry in the Church of St. John, the parish\r\nchurch of Hackney, near London, that Enoch Lynde was married on the 25th\r\nof October, 1614, to Elizabeth Digbie, a descendant of Sir John Digby.\r\nEnoch Lynde resided in London, was a merchant engaged in foreign trade,\r\nand was for some years connected with the postal service between England\r\nand Holland. He died the 23rd of April, 1636, aged fifty years.\r\n\r\nSIMON LYNDE, the third son of Enoch Lynde, was born in London in 1624.\r\nHe engaged in mercantile pursuits, and went to Holland. In 1650 he came\r\nto New England, and in the following year married Hannah, a daughter of\r\nMr. John Newgate. During the thirty years of his life in the colony, he\r\nwas a person of prominence, and acquired large landed possessions, in\r\nMassachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. In 1687 he was appointed\r\none of the Justices of the Superior Court. He died 22nd Nov. 1687,\r\npossessed of a large estate, and many children, who survived him.\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN LYNDE, the sixth son of Simon, was born 22nd September, 1666.\r\nHe records of himself that he was admitted to Harvard College on the 6th\r\nof September, 1682, by the Rev. Increase Mather, after having received\r\nhis preparatory education under the famous grammar Master, Ezekiel\r\nCheever, and received his first Degree in 1686. His father desired that\r\nhe should complete his education in England. On 27th June, 1692, he\r\nsailed for England, and was admitted he says \"for the study of Law, into\r\nthe honorable Society of the Middle Temple, Oct. 18, 1692.\" \"I was\r\ncalled to the Bar as Counsellor at Law in 1697, and received a\r\ncommission under the great Seal, for King's Advocate, in the New Court\r\nof Admiralty, in New England, in the same year.\" He returned to America\r\nDec. 24, 1697. On the 27 of April, 1699, he married Mary, daughter of\r\nHon. William Browne of Salem. In 1712 he was appointed a Judge of the\r\nSuperior Court, and in the following year a Councillor. On the\r\nresignation of Judge Sewall in 1728, he was made Chief Justice of the\r\nProvince, which office he held at the time of his death, Jan. 28, 1745,\r\nin the 79th year of his age. The Boston Evening Post said of him,\r\n\"Inflexible justice, unspotted integrity, affability, and humanity were\r\never conspicuous in him. He was a sincere friend, most affectionate in\r\nhis relations, and the delight of all that were honored with his\r\nfriendship and acquaintance.\" He left two sons, the younger, William,\r\ndied unmarried, in 1752. His eldest son,\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN LYNDE, JR. was born on the 5th of October, 1700. He graduated\r\nfrom Harvard College in 1718, and in 1721 he took his master's degree at\r\nCambridge. He soon after received the appointment of Naval Officer for\r\nSalem. In 1734 he was appointed a special judge of the Court of Common\r\nPleas, for Suffolk. In 1737 he was one of the agents in the settlement\r\nof the boundary line between New Hampshire and Massachusetts. Two years\r\nlater he was made one of the Standing Judges of Common Pleas for Essex,\r\nand in 1745, the year of his father's death, he was raised to the\r\nSuperior Bench of the Province. He was a member of the Council for many\r\nyears, but declined a re-election in 1760, in consequence of the\r\ncontroversy that arose in that year between the House and Government as\r\nto the right of Judges to sit as Councillors. On the promotion of Chief\r\nJustice Hutchinson to the executive chair, in 1771, Judge Lynde was\r\nappointed to the place now vacant, and became Chief Justice of the\r\nProvince. He resigned not many months after, pending the controversy\r\nrespecting the payment of judges' salaries by the town. He had now\r\nreached the age of 72, and \"not being inclined to ride the Circuit\r\nlonger\" he accepted the more humble and less laborious position of Judge\r\nof Probate for Essex, which office he held until the breaking out of the\r\nRevolution, not many years before his death, which was occasioned by the\r\nkick from a horse, from the effects of which he did not recover, and he\r\ndied Oct. 5th, 1781, aged 81 years. It was a remarkable coincidence that\r\nboth father and son should have been Chief Justices of the Supreme\r\nCourt, and occupied a seat on that bench, between them for nearly sixty\r\nyears. The most important trial that took place during his judicial term\r\nwas that of the so-called \"Boston Massacre,\" where the soldiers fired on\r\nthe mob in King street. At this trial Judge Lynde presided. It was a\r\ntime of great political excitement, and the occasion was one that\r\nrequired the utmost firmness, and skill on the part of the judge, to\r\nensure a just and impartial decision. These trials lasted several days,\r\nand, as has been said, \"proceeded with care and patience, on the part of\r\nthe Bench, and counsel, and both judges and jury seemed to have acted\r\nwith all the impartiality that is exhibited in the most enlightened\r\ntribunals.\" \"The result,\" says Judge Washburn, \"is a proud memorial of\r\nthe purity of the administration of justice in Massachusetts.\" Judge\r\nLynde was noted for his learning, his liberality, and his public spirit.\r\nHe was a diligent student of our Colonial history, and his diary,\r\npublished by one of his descendants, Dr. F. E. Oliver, recalls names and\r\nevents, that belong to the earlier years of the province, and records\r\nthe daily life of persons holding official positions during a period\r\nwith which many are not now familiar. He left three daughters, of whom\r\nMary, the eldest, married Hon. Andrew Oliver, Jr., one of the Judges of\r\nthe Court of Common Pleas for Essex; Hannah, who died unmarried and\r\nLydia who married Rev. William Walter, the rector of Trinity Church of\r\nBoston.[269] Both of his sons-in-law being staunch loyalists.\r\n\r\n  [269] Diaries of Benjamin Lynde and of Benjamin Lynde, Jr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PAGAN FAMILY.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT PAGAN was a native of Glasgow, Scotland, was born in 1750 and\r\ncame to Falmouth in 1769. From that time to the commencement of the war\r\nhe carried on a large lumber business and ship building. The ships which\r\nwere built were not generally employed in our trade, but with their\r\ncargoes sent to Europe and sold. Robert Pagan & Co. kept on the corner\r\nof King and Fore Streets, the largest stock of goods which was employed\r\nhere before the war. He was a man of popular manners, and much beloved\r\nby the people. He early became involved in the controversies of the\r\ntimes, and abandoned his business and country soon after the burning of\r\nFalmouth by Mowatt. In his testimony before the Claim Commission he\r\ntestified[270] \"That he uniformly declared his sentiments in favor of\r\nGreat Britain. Never submitted to join the rebels or to take no part\r\nwith them.\" He early applied for leave to quit Casco Bay with the\r\nproperty belonging to himself and copartnery. This was refused him. In\r\nthe month of February, 1776, he privately embarked his family on board a\r\nBrig he had in the harbor of Falmouth and sailed for Barbados. From that\r\nhe went home. He afterwards carried on trade at New York and Penobscot,\r\nat the latter place he remained until the end of the war, when he\r\nremoved to St. Andrews. Mr. Pagan was proscribed and banished. He\r\nsettled at St. Andrews, N. B., in 1784, and became one of the principal\r\nmen of Charlotte County. After serving the Crown as agent for lands in\r\nNew Brunswick, and in superintending affairs connected with grants to\r\nLoyalists, he was in commission as a magistrate, as a Judge of a Court,\r\nand as Colonel in the militia, and, being a favorite among the\r\nfreeholders of the county, was elected to the House of Assembly, and for\r\nseveral years was a leading member of that body. Judge Pagan died at St.\r\nAndrews, November 23, 1821 and Miriam, his widow, (a daughter of\r\nJeremiah Pote), deceased at the same place January, 1828, aged 81. They\r\nwere childless.\r\n\r\n  [270] Bureau of Archives, Ontario, 2nd Report, Vol. I. p. 340.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS PAGAN, brother to Robert Pagan. He was with his brother during\r\nthe war, and at the peace went to St. John, New Brunswick; was one of\r\nthe grantees of that city, and established himself there as a merchant.\r\nHe removed to Halifax, and while absent in Scotland for the benefit of\r\nhis health, died in 1804.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM PAGAN, brother of Robert and Thomas, was with his brothers\r\nduring the war, and at the peace settled in New Brunswick, and was a\r\nmember of the House of Assembly and of the Council. His death occurred\r\nat Fredericton, March 12, 1819.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE WYER FAMILY OF CHARLESTOWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward Wyer came from Scotland. He was a tailor, and in 1658 married\r\nElizabeth Johnson. He died May 3rd, 1693, aged 71 years. His son William\r\nwas a sea captain, and married Eleanor Jennes, Oct. 26, 1701. He died\r\nFeb., 1749, aged 69 years.\r\n\r\nDAVID WYER, son of William, was born at Charlestown, Feb. 24th, 1711. He\r\nalso was a sea captain. Married Rebecca Russell, Feb. 2, 1738. He\r\nremoved to Falmouth (Portland) and was an officer of the Customs there.\r\nAll the officers of the revenue of that port were loyal except one,\r\nThomas Child, who joined the Revolutionists. They all became refugees,\r\nand abandoned their country. During the military possession of the town\r\nby Thompson (before the burning of it by Captain Mowatt) he was required\r\nto give his presence before the Board of War as being a Tory.\r\n\r\nDAVID WYER, JR., son of the aforesaid David was born at Charlestown in\r\n1741, and graduated at Harvard College in 1758. In 1762 he was admitted\r\nto the bar, and commenced the practice of law at Falmouth. On the\r\ntestimony of other lawyers who practiced in Maine prior to the\r\nRevolution, it was said of Wyer, that \"he was a high-minded stirling\r\nfellow of strong talents, an able and eloquent advocate, and extremely\r\nindependent in his opinions and character.\" Without the regular\r\nappointment and commission of Attorney of the Crown, Mr. Wyer acted in\r\nthat capacity when occasion required the services of such an officer in\r\nthe Courts of Maine. He died in 1776 at Stroudwater, to which place he\r\nremoved after the burning of Falmouth, at the age of thirty-five, of an\r\nepidemic which prevailed at that time, and which carried off many\r\npersons old and young. Mrs. Wyer, a niece of Hon. Thomas Russell and two\r\nchildren survived him. One of the latter married Captain Samuel Waite of\r\nPortland.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS WYER, brother of David Wyer, Jr., was born at Charlestown, June\r\n15, 1744. Married Sarah Francis, March 8th, 1766 in Medford. He removed\r\nto Falmouth with his father, was also employed as an officer of the\r\nCustoms. He lost L325 in real and personal estate by the burning of the\r\ntown in 1775. He did all he could to support the government; he refused\r\nto serve in the rebel army, on which he was taken up and abused by the\r\nmob, and obliged to pay a fine. Was taken before the Provincial Congress\r\nat Watertown, and obliged to quit Falmouth in 1777 in an open boat with\r\nhis father-in-law, Jeremiah Pote, in which they went to Nova Scotia. In\r\n1778 he was proscribed and banished. In 1779 he was in New York and was\r\ncommissioned as captain of an armed vessel, the brigantine \"British\r\nTar,\" 65 men. He was in command of this vessel for nine months, during\r\nwhich time he had two engagements with two rebel privateers at different\r\ntimes. He had a house and lot in Falmouth, which was confiscated, and a\r\nhalf interest in a cargo burned at Falmouth. In 1784, he went to St.\r\nAndrew, N. B., with other Loyalists, and continued there until his\r\ndecease. He was an Agent of the British Government for settling and\r\nallotting lands to adherents of the Crown in the Revolution. The first\r\nSheriff of Charlotte County, was a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas\r\nand Deputy Colonial Treasurer. In 1790 he went on a year's tour to\r\nEurope, and on his return became a merchant, and had extensive lumber\r\ninterests. He died February 24th, 1824. He had a numerous family, was\r\nmarried three times, his first wife Sarah Francis of Medford, second\r\nJoanna Pote of Falmouth, third Mary Hunt, who died 25 October, 1801,\r\naged 37. An only son survived him.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS WYER, JR., a member of her Majesty's Council, Justice of the\r\nCommon Pleas, member of the Board of Education, Commissioner of Wrecks,\r\nand Lieutenant-Colonel in the militia. He married Sarah, daughter of\r\nThomas Tompkins, of St. Andrews, 24 March, 1808, and died at St.\r\nAndrews, December, 1848, aged sixty-nine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       JEREMIAH POTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM POTE was in Marblehead as early as 1688. He married Hannah\r\nGreenfield. His second wife was Ann Hooper, whom he married in 1689. His\r\nson William was born at Marblehead, 1690, who married, June 2, 1718,\r\nDorothy Getchell.\r\n\r\nJEREMIAH POTE, son of the aforesaid, was born at Marblehead, Jan. 18,\r\n1724. His father removed to Falmouth, now Portland, and died there.\r\nJeremiah Pote became one of the principal merchants of the town, he\r\nowned and occupied one of the two principal wharves in that town\r\nprevious to the Revolution. He transacted a large business and filled\r\noffices of trust and honor. In his testimony before the Claim\r\nCommission[271] \"Claimt says He is a native of America. Lived at\r\nFalmouth, Casco Bay, when trouble broke out. He did everything in his\r\npower against the measure of the Rebels. He happened to be one of the\r\nselectmen at Falmouth, whose business it was to give notice of Town\r\nMeetings. Claimt refused to notify the meetings desired by the Rebels.\r\nIn consequence of this he was persecuted. Was imprisoned several times.\r\nHad his things taken from him by force, so that he was forced to quit\r\nhome, got to Nova Scotia, went in open boat. Went from Halifax to New\r\nYork in 1778. Was employed by Admiral Gambin to pilot a vessel to New\r\nHampshire, which was going with Sir Henry Clinton, Manisfestoes. The\r\nvessel was seized and the whole crew made prisoners and kept in prison\r\nduring the winter. Went to Penobscot in 1780 to St. Andrews in the\r\nbeginning of 1784.\"\r\n\r\n  [271] Bureau of Archives, Ontario, 2nd Report, Vol. II, p. 904.\r\n\r\nIn 1774 a public meeting was called to consider the state of public\r\naffairs, which he attended, but he desired that his dissent might be\r\nentered against a resolution relative to the Ministry and East India\r\nCompany, which was introduced and passed.\r\n\r\nIn 1775, during the trouble with Captain Mowatt, which resulted in the\r\nburning of the town, in which he lost L1,000, he brought upon himself\r\nthe vengeance of the Revolutionists, who under Thompson, assumed the\r\ngovernment, and organized themselves into a board of war, and required\r\nhim to contribute money and provisions, and to give a bond of L2,000 to\r\nappear at the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts, and give an account\r\nof his conduct. In 1778 he was proscribed and banished. After the peace\r\nhe settled at St. Andrews at the mouth of the St. Croix river, the\r\nboundary line between Maine and New Brunswick, where he died November\r\n23, 1796, aged seventy-one years. His son Robert, deceased at the same\r\nplace November 8, 1794, at the age of twenty-five, and his daughter,\r\nJoanna, married Thomas Wyer, Jr., his widow Elizabeth Berry of Kittery,\r\ndied December 24, 1809, aged seventy-nine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            EBENEZER CUTLER.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN 1 CUTLER came from Spranston, two miles from north of Norwich, and\r\nabout eight miles south of Hingham, in the County of Norfolk, England.\r\nHis name first appears among the persecuted adherents of Rev. Robert\r\nPeck, A. M., of Hingham, who \"sold their possessions for half their\r\nvalue, and named the place of their settlement after their natal town.\"\r\nHe embarked, it is believed, in the Rose of Yarmouth, William Andrews,\r\nJr., Master, which sailed on or about April 18, 1637. He was at Hingham\r\nby or a little after June 10th following, when land was assigned him. He\r\ncame attended by his wife Mary, seven children, and one servant. He died\r\nthe following year, which must have subjected his widow and children to\r\ngreat hardships. His third son,\r\n\r\nSAMUEL 2 CUTLER, was born in England in 1629, was of Marblehead in 1654,\r\nof Salem in 1655, of Topsfield and Hingham in 1671, and of Gloucester,\r\nMarch 17, 1693. In 1671 he as heir and attorney for his brothers and\r\nsisters, united with his mother in the sale of their patrimonial estate\r\nin Hingham. He was often called to settle and appraise estates. He died\r\nin 1700, 71 years of age. He had two sons and three daughters. His\r\nsecond eldest son,\r\n\r\nEBENEZER 3 CUTLER, was born at Salem in 1664, where he married Mary,\r\ndaughter of Zacheray and Mary March. Mr. Cutler died about 1729 at Salem\r\nand the widow in 1734, the sale of the homestead being effected soon\r\nafter, and the family removed from Salem. He had six children, four sons\r\nand two daughters. The eldest son,\r\n\r\nEBENEZER 4 CUTLER, was born in Salem, October 1, 1695. He was a farmer\r\nand brickmaker. He married May, daughter of William Stockwell, Oct. 16,\r\n1732. He inherited the farm in Sutton, Mass., purchased of William\r\nStockwell by his father, and on which he settled previous to 1728. It is\r\nsaid that three of his sons resided on this farm at one time, each\r\noccupying separate houses. He died in 1779, and had two daughters and\r\nfive sons.\r\n\r\nEBENEZER 5 CUTLER, son of the aforesaid,[272] settled in the town of\r\nOxford, Mass., as an inn keeper and trader. He married Miriam Eager,\r\nsister of his brother Zackeus' wife, and daughter of James Eager of\r\nWestboro, Mass., Nov. 24, 1764. Mrs. Cutler was a sister of Colonel\r\nEager, who was a Loyalist and settled in Victory, Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\n  [272] See Cutler Genealogy for descent of Ebenezer 4.\r\n\r\nBefore the commencement of hostilities he tried to be neutral, but when\r\nthe tea troubles arose, he went quietly at night, and purchased a\r\nquantity of it, on the return with his supply a masked band interrupted\r\nhim, took the tea from him and burnt it. That decided him, which side to\r\ntake, and he became a staunch loyalist.\r\n\r\nEbenezer Cutler was a trader which caused him to travel considerably\r\nabout the country, and being very independant and outspoken he soon had\r\nmany enemies among the Revolutionists, and a price was set on his\r\ncapture. He had many narrow escapes before they got him. Once he was\r\nhidden in a farmhouse between the chimney and outer wall, most\r\nsuffocated by smoke.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Correspondence made charges against him, and sent him\r\nwith the evidence of his misconduct to General Ward at Cambridge, the\r\ncharges were as follows:\r\n\r\n                                        Northboro, May 17th, 1775.\r\n\r\n     Sir:\r\n\r\n     We the Committee of Correspondence of the Town of Northboro having\r\n     taken into our custody Mr. Ebenezer Cutler, late of Groton, but now\r\n     of this town, which from his conduct appears to us to be an avowed\r\n     enemy of his Country, he has set at naught and despises all the\r\n     Resolutions of the Continental and Provincial Congress, and also\r\n     utterly refuses to act in any defence of his now perishing country\r\n     whatever, and as he has from his past conduct, ever since we have\r\n     been struggling for the Liberties of our Country appeared in the\r\n     eyes of the Public to be aiding and abetting, in defeating the\r\n     plans of the good people of this Province, and has been riding from\r\n     one part of this province to the other, and in our opinion for no\r\n     good design, we think it highly necessary to send him to the\r\n     Council of war, to know whether he may (as he desires) have a pass\r\n     to go into Boston: we also inclose the substance of two evidences\r\n     concerning said Cutler.\r\n\r\n       By order of the Committee of Correspondence,\r\n                                                GILMAN BASS, Clerk.\r\n\r\n     N. B. General Ward, we apprehend is well acquainted with the\r\n     character and conduct of said Cutler.[273]\r\n\r\n  [273] \"Royalists\" in Mass. Archives, Vol. 1, p. 6.\r\n\r\nHis case was submitted to Congress, when it appeared that he had spoken\r\n\"many things disrespectful of the Continental and Provincial Congress\"\r\nthat he had \"acted against their resolves,\" had said that \"he would\r\nassist Gage,\" had called such as signed the town-covenant or\r\nnon-consumption agreement \"dammed fools\" etc., etc. A resolve to commit\r\nhim to prison was refused a passage, and a resolve that he be allowed to\r\njoin the British troops at Boston was also lost. But subsequently he was\r\nallowed to go into that town \"without his effects.\" On the evacuation of\r\nBoston he accompanied the British Army to Halifax. He settled at\r\nAnnapolis Royal, and with the money which the British government paid\r\nhim in compensation for his losses, he established himself in business\r\nthere. After his home in Oxford was broken up, his wife Miriam, and\r\nchildren, went to her mother, Mrs. Eager, in Worcester. His wife died\r\nthere. Mrs. Eager was a strong Loyalist, one day a party of Rebels\r\nvisited her, and she sent them off by some ready quotations of\r\nscripture. She and her sons brought the family to Annapolis and then\r\nsettled on a farm in Nisteaux.\r\n\r\nAfter a few years Ebenezer Cutler went to England on a visit and there\r\nmarried Mary, daughter of Colonel Hicks, of the 70th Regiment. Two\r\nchildren were born in England and four in N. S. He was protonotary of\r\nthe County of Annapolis, and was a zealous Episcopalian. He died there\r\nin 1831, quite aged. Mary, his widow, died at the same place in 1839. He\r\nwas proscribed and banished in 1778, and his property was confiscated\r\nand inventoried April 5th, 1779. Aug. 3rd the judge appointed a\r\ncommission to settle his estate. His first wife, Miriam, died at\r\nNorthboro, Mass., and her estate was inventoried Sept. 10, 1784,\r\namounting to L100. He had by her eight children.\r\n\r\nEBENEZER 6 CUTLER, son of the aforesaid, was born at Oxford, Mass. Aug.\r\n27th, 1765. He was a student at Harvard at the commencement of\r\nhostilities, when he was obliged to leave. Opposite his name in the\r\nCollege archives, is the name \"Traitor,\" which means just the opposite,\r\nthat he was a Loyalist. He went to Nova Scotia with his father. He was\r\nan expert accountant, and crown land surveyor. Here he resided several\r\nyears, but settled finally at Moncton. One day in going up the street,\r\npassing Mr. Wilmot's, he saw a very beautiful girl leaning over the\r\ngate, a visitor of Mrs. Wilmot, Olivia Dickson. It was a case of love at\r\nfirst sight. He met a friend a few minutes after and told him that he\r\nhad just seen his wife that was to be. In due time they were married. On\r\none of his voyages as supercargo, the vessel was taken by a Spanish\r\nprivateer, off Jamaica. The captain recognized him as a Free Mason, gave\r\nhim liberty, set him ashore at Port Antonio, where he obtained a mule,\r\nand crossed the mountains to Kingston where he took a vessel for Nova\r\nScotia. He died in 1839. He had ten children, six daughters and four\r\nsons, the tenth child born was\r\n\r\nREBECCA 7 CUTLER, who married John Whitman of Annapolis whose ancestor\r\ncame from Plymouth County, Mass., and settled in Nova Scotia previous to\r\nthe Revolution. William Whitman of Boston and Clarence Whitman of New\r\nYork are children of John Whitman and Rebecca Cutler.\r\n\r\nRobert J. Dysart and Hugh Dysart, accountants of Boston, are descendants\r\nin the third generation from Ebenezer Cutler and Olivia Dickson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Engagement at the North Bridge in Concord.\r\n\r\n1 The Detachment of the Regulars who fired first on the Provincials at\r\nthe Bridge.\r\n\r\n2 The Provincials headed by Colonel Robinson & Major Buttrick\r\n\r\n3 The Bridge]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE STORY CONCERNING THE KILLING OF THE TWO SOLDIERS AT CONCORD\r\nBRIDGE, APRIL 19TH, 1775. THE FIRST BRITISH SOLDIER KILLED IN THE\r\nREVOLUTIONARY WAR.\r\n\r\nSee page 53.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the skirmish at Lexington, the king's troops marched into Concord\r\nin two columns, the infantry coming over the hill from which the\r\nAmericans had retreated, and the grenadiers and marines followed the\r\nhigh road. On reaching the Court house Colonel Smith ordered six\r\ncompanies (about two hundred men) under Captain Parsons, to hold the\r\nbridge and destroy certain stores on the other side. With the balance of\r\nhis command he remained in the center of the town destroying such\r\nwarlike stores as could be found, this being the object of the\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nCaptain Parsons in the meantime, posted three companies under Captain\r\nLaurie at the bridge, while he proceeded to Colonel Barrett's home in\r\nsearch of stores. The Americans had gathered on the high ground, west of\r\nthe bridge, and now numbered about four hundred and fifty men,\r\nrepresenting many of the neighboring towns. The Acton company in front,\r\nled by Capt. Isaac Davis, marched in double file and with trailed arms\r\nfor the bridge. The British guard, numbering about one hundred men, drew\r\nup in line of battle on the opposite side of the bridge, and opened fire\r\nupon them. Capt. Davis, and Abner Hosmer, of the same company, both fell\r\ndead. Seeing this, Major Buttrick shouted \"Fire, fellow soldiers! for\r\nGod's sake fire!\" The order was instantly obeyed. One of the British was\r\nkilled, and several wounded, one severely, who was left on the ground,\r\nwhen the British retreated to the center of the village. The Americans\r\nturned aside to occupy favorable positions on the adjacent hills.[274] A\r\nyoung man named Ammi White was chopping wood for Rev. William Emerson at\r\nthe \"Old Manse\" at the east end of the bridge, while the firing was\r\ngoing on he hid under cover of the wood-pile, when it was over he went\r\nto the bridge, saw one British soldier dead, another badly wounded,\r\ngrasping his axe he struck the wounded soldier on the head crushing in\r\nhis skull, then taking the soldier's gun, he went off home. The gun is\r\nnow in the rooms of the Antiquarian Society of Concord. In the meantime,\r\nthe detachment under Capt. Parsons returned from the Barrett house,\r\ncrossed the bridge, passed the dead bodies of the soldiers and joined\r\nthe main body unmolested. They reported when they arrived at Boston,\r\nthat the wounded soldier at the bridge had been scalped and his ears cut\r\noff.\r\n\r\n  [274] This description of the affair at Concord Bridge, was written by\r\n  Rev. E. G. Porter, President of the New England Historic Genealogical\r\n  Society for a work entitled \"Antique Views of Boston.\" Pp. 234-8\r\n  compiled by me in 1882. J. H. Stark.\r\n\r\nVery little was said during the past hundred years concerning the\r\ninhuman act of Ammi White, in fact this is the first time the name of\r\nthe perpetrator of the outrage has been published. It was not a popular\r\nsubject to be discussed in the Council of the \"Sons and Daughters of the\r\nAmerican Revolution\" when assembled to recount the \"brave deeds of their\r\npatriotic forefathers.\" Hawthorne mentions it in the \"Old Manse\" pp. 12,\r\n13.\r\n\r\nThe writer's attention was first drawn to it by an article in the Boston\r\npapers concerning the observances of \"Patriots Day,\" April 19th, 1903.\r\nIt was as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"A story of the Concord fight not told by guides who take tourists\r\n     to the graves of the soldiers by the Concord bridge was told by the\r\n     Rev. Franklin Hamilton, preaching on \"Patriots' Day and Its\r\n     Lessons\" last evening at the First Methodist Episcopal Church.\r\n\r\n     \"It shows,\" said he, \"that the British soldiers were men like you\r\n     and me. It shows that the story of that fateful battle hour found\r\n     many weeping hearts across the sea. Your histories tell you how two\r\n     British soldiers, a sergeant and a private, were killed, and are\r\n     buried under the pines by the wall. One was killed and the other\r\n     wounded. As the wounded soldier was crawling away he was met by a\r\n     boy who had been chopping wood, and who, inflamed with the spirit\r\n     of the hour, struck him dead with his axe. Mr. Bartlett of Concord\r\n     tells me that not so long ago a young woman came to Concord and\r\n     asked to be shown where the British soldiers lay. She came from\r\n     Nottinghamshire, and was a relative of one of them. She went to the\r\n     graves and placed upon them a wreath, singing as she did so 'God\r\n     Save the King.'\"\r\n\r\nThis led me to examine into the case. I found that there was\r\nconsiderable rivalry of feeling between the towns of Concord and Acton\r\nas to the part each took in the fight. There was a saying that \"Acton\r\nfurnished the men, and Concord the ground.\" And that there was not a\r\nConcord man killed, wounded or missing in the \"Concord Fight.\" In the\r\nCentennial observances at Acton in 1835, the Address was delivered by\r\nJosiah Adams. He said:\r\n\r\n     \"That two were killed at the bridge is certainly true, and it is\r\n     true too that historians have published to the world that they were\r\n     killed in the engagement.\r\n\r\n     \"It is true also, that a monument is about to be placed over them on\r\n     the spot to perpetuate American valor. The manner in which one of\r\n     them met his death as disclosed in the depositions of Mr. Thorp,\r\n     Mr. Smith and Mr. Handley, namely by a hatchet after he was wounded\r\n     and left behind, was well known at the time. It was the action of\r\n     an excited and thoughtless youth who was afterwards sufficiently\r\n     penitent and miserable and whose name therefore will not be given.\r\n     But the attempt to conceal the act from the world which was made at\r\n     the time, and has since continued, cannot be approved. It would\r\n     surely have been better to have given it to the world accompanied\r\n     by the detestation and horror which it merited and received. Thorp\r\n     in his deposition said: 'Two of the enemy were killed--one with a\r\n     hatchet after bring wounded and helpless. This act was a matter of\r\n     horror to all of us. I saw him sitting up and wounded as we passed\r\n     the bridge.'\"\r\n\r\n     Smith said: \"One of them was left on the ground wounded and in that\r\n     situation was killed by an American with a hatchet.\" Handley said:\r\n     \"The young man who killed him told me in 1807 that it worried him\r\n     very much.\"\r\n\r\n     This inhuman act was of course reported by the British and a Boston\r\n     paper represented that one killed at the bridge at Concord was\r\n     scalped and the ears cut off from his head. This led to a\r\n     deposition from Brown and Davis that the truth may be known. They\r\n     testified that they buried the bodies at the bridge, that neither\r\n     of those persons were scalped, nor their ears cut off.\r\n\r\n     If there be any one left to advocate such a proceeding, he will say\r\n     that the deposition was true to the letter. But alas! it was in the\r\n     letter only. It had the most essential characteristic of\r\n     falsehood--the intention to make a false impression in regard to\r\n     what was known to be the subject of inquiry to have it believed\r\n     that both men were killed in the engagement.\"\r\n\r\n     \"If a monument is to be erected by the authority of a town, one of\r\n     the most respectable in the County of Middlesex, let it be seen\r\n     that its inscription contains the truth, the whole truth, and\r\n     nothing but the truth, relative to the subject matters\r\n     thereof.\"[275]\r\n\r\n  [275] Centennial Address delivered at Acton, July 21, 1835, by Josiah\r\n  Adams, pp. 44-5-6.\r\n\r\nMy attention was next attracted to the soldiers' graves at Concord\r\nBridge by the following letters that appeared in the Boston Transcript:\r\n\r\n                          BRITISH GRAVES AT CONCORD.\r\n\r\n     To the Editor of the Transcript:\r\n\r\n     I want to say in your columns something which has been on my mind\r\n     frequently since I went to Concord Bridge on my recent visit to\r\n     America. It has mingled some sadness with an otherwise most\r\n     delightful visit.\r\n\r\n     By the side of the road there are the graves of the British\r\n     soldiers who fell there, unnamed and unhonored by us, yet they died\r\n     doing what they conceived to be their duty just as your men did.\r\n     The loneliness and unrecognized character of these graves struck me\r\n     sadly, and I have often since wished that they, too, might have\r\n     some tribute to their stanch, if misplaced bravery. Now in looking\r\n     (as I constantly do) through the writings of my most dear friend\r\n     and counsellor, James Russell Lowell, I find he has exactly struck\r\n     the note I want in his poem, \"Lines suggested by the graves of the\r\n     two English soldiers on Concord Battleground.\" The third verse\r\n     would make a fitting tribute to the character of these men. It runs\r\n     as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"These men were brave enough and true\r\n  To the hired soldiers' bull-dog creed;\r\n  What brought them here they never knew,\r\n  They fought as suits the English breed;\r\n  They came three thousand miles and died\r\n  To keep the past upon its throne--\r\n  Unheard, beyond the ocean tide,\r\n  Their English mother made her moan.\"\r\n\r\n     Do you think there might be found, among the splendidly patriotic\r\n     Daughters of the Revolution, some sufficiently generous-minded to\r\n     put this American poet's recognition of the worth of these poor\r\n     fellows on a small tablet near the graves? I would at least ask\r\n     whether the last two lines of this verse do not move the heart of\r\n     any woman.\r\n\r\n     I do not know how public sentiment toward the sacred ground of\r\n     Concord battlefield might regard such an intrusion, and if the\r\n     words were those of any but such a man as Lowell, so associated\r\n     with the locality and imbued with all that that fight meant to your\r\n     nation, I would not be so bold as to suggest it. I know that this\r\n     is really a national, not an individual, matter and that a\r\n     stranger ought not to intermeddle with it. I am only making my\r\n     little moan in sympathy with the English mother whose heart Lowell\r\n     so beautifully understands.\r\n\r\n                                                           ALBERT WEBB.\r\n     Elderslie, London Road, Worcester, Eng., March 31, 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe editor's comments on the letters was in part as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The letter in another column pleading for a memorial tablet,\r\n     bearing suggested and suggestive lines from Lowell, at the grave of\r\n     the two British soldiers slain at the North Bridge, Concord, should\r\n     challenge attention and it is difficult to see why it should\r\n     challenge antagonism. The grave is now marked by two stones half\r\n     sunken in the mold with which kindly nature everywhere seeks to\r\n     efface the evidences of human strife. It is protected by chains\r\n     which were provided some thirty years ago by a British resident of\r\n     Boston. On a stone of the wall sheltering the grave is an\r\n     inscription setting forth who sleep below. Neither the inscription\r\n     nor the defence was strictly necessary, for all Concord knows where\r\n     the grave is, and tradition has preserved the names of the two men\r\n     who buried the slain, giving them hasty but not irreverent\r\n     interment. Nor has there ever been danger of vandalism. The old New\r\n     England reverence for the last resting place of the dead protected\r\n     the sleepers for one hundred years, and the chain fence is more the\r\n     tribute of a countryman to these friendless and nameless victims of\r\n     George III.'s policy than a precaution. The same spirit which\r\n     protected those two soldiers' resting place would doubtless not see\r\n     anything objectionable in a bronze tablet carrying Lowell's lines.\r\n     Certainly the people of Concord, the descendants of the Minutemen,\r\n     would be the last to feel incensed at this tribute, if tribute it\r\n     be, or this reminder of permanent material, of the historic dust\r\n     that must in these one hundred and thirty-four years have turned\r\n     into earth.\r\n\r\n     \"These two soldiers are none the less historical characters because\r\n     their identity is unknown. What their names or grades neither\r\n     history nor research tells. They were just common men in the ranks,\r\n     in the era when the private soldier was simply so much food for\r\n     powder.\r\n\r\n     \"But apart from the influence of local sentiment, there is a broad\r\n     public opinion that guards a soldier's sepulchre, even if he was an\r\n     enemy in life. This opinion is expressed in the general custom in\r\n     this country to allow both sides memorials on the great\r\n     battlefields of our Civil War.\r\n\r\n     \"If the suggested tablet should be erected at Concord, if\r\n     'patriotism' should at first think too much honor were done these\r\n     'hireling soldiers,' would not reflection remind that when the\r\n     'embattled farmers'--who, by the way, were led by a veteran and\r\n     accomplished officer--and the regulars faced one another across the\r\n     narrow stream both were proud of the name of Englishmen? Concord\r\n     was then a microcosm of English America, which up to the very verge\r\n     of hostilities had drunk the King's health and had clung\r\n     desperately to the foolish fond belief that he was a good sovereign\r\n     misled by designing ministers.\"\r\n\r\nThis led me to further investigate this matter, for I had been informed\r\nthat the graves had been desecrated some years ago under authority of\r\nthe town officials. I therefore caused to be published in the Boston\r\nTranscript under the heading of \"Notes and Queries\" the following query:\r\n\r\n     (7891.) 1. Can anyone give the names of the two British soldiers\r\n     killed at Concord Bridge, or inform me if there were any papers\r\n     taken from their bodies that would identity them? I have been\r\n     informed that there were.\r\n\r\n     2. One of the soldiers was left wounded on the bridge; what was the\r\n     name of the \"young American that killed him with a hatchet\"?\r\n\r\n     3. When did the selectmen of Concord give Professor Fowler\r\n     permission to dig up the two bodies of the British soldiers and\r\n     remove the skulls to be used for exhibition purposes?\r\n\r\n                                                         J. H. S.\r\n     April 6, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONUMENT TO COMMEMORATE THE SKIRMISH AT CONCORD BRIDGE.\r\n\r\nThe letter A on the left of the engraving, marks the site of the graves\r\nof the two British Soldiers. The first killed in the Revolution.]\r\n\r\nThe only answer received was the following:\r\n\r\n     \"7891. 3. The indirect intimations of J. H. S. are shrewd, but\r\n     before the alleged action of the selectmen excites the Concord\r\n     people, they should insist upon his producing adequate evidence.\r\n                                                       ROCKINGHAM.\"\r\n\r\nThe adequate evidence was produced and is as follows:\r\n\r\n                                \"The Worcester Society of Antiquity,\r\n                              Worcester, Massachusetts, April 12, 1909.\r\n\r\n     Mr. James H. Stark,\r\n\r\n     Dear Sir:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Barton has handed your letter to me and I write to say that the\r\n     skulls of those two British Soldiers killed at the bridge in\r\n     Concord were once the property of this Society, we having purchased\r\n     them of the Widow of Prof. Fowler, the phrenologist, who some years\r\n     ago went about the country giving lectures and illustrating his\r\n     subjects. Prof. Fowler got permission to dig up those skulls from\r\n     the Selectmen of Concord, and he carried them about with him and\r\n     used them in his lecturing. After his death one of the members\r\n     learned of them and we purchased the skulls and they were in our\r\n     museum some time. The late Senator Hoar learning that we had them,\r\n     came to know if we would be willing to return them to Concord that\r\n     they might be put back in the ground from whence they were taken.\r\n     As he seemed quite anxious about it, consent was given, and they\r\n     were sent to Concord to be placed in their original resting place.\r\n     Presume they are there at the present time.\r\n\r\n                                         Yours,\r\n                                               ELLERY B. CRANE.\r\n                                                          Librarian.\"\r\n\r\nThe only excuse offered for the inhuman act of Ammi White was found over\r\none hundred years after the crime was committed. It is now said that he\r\nwas only a boy, and that the wounded soldier cried out for water, and\r\nthat while giving it to him he tried to kill him with his bayonet. This\r\nis all false, there is no evidence whatever to prove it, in fact Thorp,\r\none of the deponents said \"he was killed with a hatchet after being\r\nwounded and helpless, and the act was a matter of horror to all of us.\"\r\nHandley said \"The young man who killed him told me in 1807 that it\r\nworried him very much.\" Here is not the slightest evidence that White\r\nkilled him in self defence, neither was he the boy as represented, for I\r\nfind that he enlisted five days after killing the soldier, in Capt.\r\nAbishai Brown's Co. Col. John Nixon's (5) Regiment. He enlisted April\r\n24, 1775, June 10, 1775 signed advance pay order at Cambridge, Aug. 1,\r\n1775, Private on muster roll at that date. Service 3 months 15 days.\r\nCompany return dated Sept. 30, 1775.[276]\r\n\r\n  [276] Rev. Soldiers and Sailors. Vol. 17, p. 42.\r\n\r\nI am pleased to state that a few weeks after the aforesaid letters\r\nappeared in the Transcript, that the town authorities at Concord gave\r\npermission to the \"British Army and Navy Veterans\" of Boston, to march\r\non Memorial Day, May 30, 1909, to the graves of the two soldiers and to\r\ndecorate same, which was accordingly done. The graves of the soldiers\r\nare referred to in the Transcript article as being \"protected by chains,\r\nwhich were provided some thirty years ago by a British resident of\r\nBoston.\" The party referred to was Mr. Herbert Radcliffe, a member of\r\nthe British Charitable Society. The facts which I have stated here,\r\nconcerning what occurred, \"Where once the embattled farmers stood and\r\nfired the shot heard round the world\" is not done with a view of\r\nreviving old grievances, or re-opening old sores, but that the historic\r\ntruth may be known concerning \"the shot heard round the world,\" for\r\nhistory should know no concealment, and as Josiah Adams truly said, \"the\r\ntruth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, should be told\r\nrelative to this matter.\"\r\n\r\nIf it be said that these are old stories of the past, we reply that\r\nthese misrepresentations are being quoted as having actually occurred\r\nand are made living issues for to-day by numerous societies formed for\r\nthat; and kindred purposes. Even those societies designed to keep in\r\nremembrance their honored ancestors' part in the Revolution, make it a\r\npoint to perpetuate their historic fables and falsehoods in the belief\r\nthat anything is good enough to be said of their historic opponent.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE ENGAGEMENT AT THE NORTH BRIDGE IN CONCORD, WHERE THE TWO SOLDIERS\r\n                                WERE KILLED.\r\n\r\nIn the American army which was formed at Cambridge immediately after the\r\naffair at Lexington and Concord, there were two young artists from\r\nConnecticut, Amos Doolittle, afterwards a well known engraver, and a\r\nportrait painter by the name of Earl, both members of the New Haven\r\ncompany. During their stay at Cambridge, these young men improved the\r\nopportunity by visiting Lexington and Concord, for the purpose of\r\nstudying the battle field and making drawings of the several localities,\r\nthe buildings, and the forces in action. The drawings were mostly made\r\nby Earl, and afterwards engraved by Doolittle, on his return to New\r\nHaven the same year. The four plates were each twelve by eighteen inches\r\nin size, and have been claimed to be the first series of historical\r\nprints ever published in this country. \"Plate III., the battle of the\r\nNorth Bridge in Concord\" shown here in reduced size from the\r\nreproduction of the original in \"Stark's Antique Views of Boston.\" In\r\nthis engraving, one soldier is seen falling, near the spot where the two\r\nsoldiers are buried.\r\n\r\n\r\n            THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\nBoss or ring rule is not a modern invention, for at the time of the\r\nRevolution, Sam Adams was the political boss of Boston, Gordon in his\r\n\"History of the American Revolution\" under date of 1775, traces this\r\npractice to a much earlier date. \"More than 50 years ago Mr. Samuel\r\nAdams' father and 20 others, one or two, from the north end of the town,\r\nwhere all the ship business is carried on used to meet, make a caucus,\r\nand lay their plans for introducing certain persons into places of trust\r\nand power. By acting in concert, together with a careful and extensive\r\ndistribution of ballots, they generally carried the elections to their\r\nown mind.\" In this manner Sam Adams first became a representative for\r\nBoston, and then its Boss. At this period ship building was one of the\r\nleading industries of Boston. Originally the \"Caucus Club\" was a\r\nmechanics club called from the leading trade in it the \"Calkers' Club,\"\r\nwhich name, with a variation it still retained after it had passed in\r\nthe hands of politicians.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to exaggerate the influence such secret societies as\r\nthe Caucuses, and Sons of Liberty, had upon the events which helped to\r\nbring on the conflict with the mother country. The \"Sons of Liberty\" met\r\nin a distillery, and also the Green Dragon Tavern, and arose out of the\r\nexcitement attending the passage of the Stamp Act. John Adams in his\r\ndiary gives some interesting glimpses of their clubs, where the\r\nRevolution was born, he says \"Feb. 1, 1763. This day learned that the\r\nCaucus Club meets at certain times in the garret of Tom Dawes, the\r\nadjutant of the Boston regiment. He has a large house, and he has a\r\nmovable partition in his garret, which he takes down and the whole club\r\nmeets in one room. There they smoke tobacco till you cannot see from one\r\nend of the garret to the other. Then they drink flip I suppose, and\r\nthere they choose a moderator, who puts questions to the vote regularly,\r\nand selectmen, assessors, collectors, wardens, and representatives, are\r\nregularly chosen before they are chosen in the town. Fairfield, Story,\r\nRuddock, Adams, Cooper, and a rudis indigestaque moles of others are\r\nmembers.\"\r\n\r\n\"January 15, 1766. Spent the evening with the Sons of Liberty at their\r\nown apartments in Hanover Square near the Tree of Liberty. It is a\r\ncounting-room in Chase & Speakman's distillery; a very small room it is.\r\nThere were present John Avery, a distiller of liberal education; John\r\nSmith, the brazier; Thomas Chase, distiller; Joseph Fields, master of a\r\nvessel; Henry Bass, George Trott, jeweler; and Henry Wells. I was very\r\ncordially and respectfully treated by all present. We had punch, wine,\r\npipes and tobacco, biscuit and cheese, etc.\"\r\n\r\nChas. J. Gettemy in commenting on same, says:[277]\r\n\r\n  [277] The True Story of Paul Revere, p. 45, by Charles J. Gettemy, Chief\r\n  of the Bureau of Statistics and Labor of the Commonwealth of\r\n  Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\"From which it appears that politicians are much the same in all times.\r\nPublic officials were chosen by a ring in Boston in the year of our Lord\r\n1763 before they were \"chosen by the town\" =and the Revolution was\r\nhatched in a rum-shop=, while those upon whom history has placed the\r\nseal of greatness and statesmanship filled themselves with \"flip\" in an\r\natmosphere dense with tobacco smoke as they plotted and planned the\r\nmomentous events of the time!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PAUL REVERE THE SCOUT.\r\n\r\nPaul Revere was born in Boston, Dec. 21, 1734, his father was a Huguenot\r\nnamed Rivoire, which in time became Revere. When Revere left school he\r\nwent into his father's shop to learn the art of gold and silver smith.\r\n\r\nHis first military experience was when he was twenty-one years old, in\r\nthe expedition against Crown Point, in which he held the king's\r\ncommission from Gov. Wm. Shirley as second lieutenant of artillery. The\r\nservice proved uneventful, it continued for six months and then the\r\nenterprise was abandoned.\r\n\r\nOn his return he took an increasing and prominent part in the political\r\nlife of the time, and on one occasion his pugnacious disposition got him\r\ninto the police court, in 1761, where he had to pay a fine and be bound\r\nover to keep the peace.\r\n\r\nRevere became quite skilled in drawing and engraving on copper, and the\r\nexciting political events of the time readily lent themselves to\r\npictorial treatment. Probably the best known of Revere's copper-plate\r\nengraving, was that of the so-called \"State Street Massacre.\" It has\r\nsince, however, been discovered that in this instance he appropriated\r\nthe work of Henry Pelham, the half brother of Copley the artist[278] as\r\nthe following letter will show:\r\n\r\n                                               Boston, March 29th, 1770.\r\n\r\n     Sir:\r\n\r\n     When I heard that you was cutting a plate of the late Murder, I\r\n     thought it impossible as I knew you was not capable of doing it\r\n     unless you copied it from mine and as I thought I had intrusted it\r\n     in the hands of a person who had more regard to the dictates of\r\n     Honor and Justice than to take the undue advantage you have done of\r\n     the confidence and trust I reposed in you. But I find that I was\r\n     mistaken and after being at great Trouble and Expense of making a\r\n     design, paying for paper, printing, etc., find myself in the most\r\n     ungenerous Manner deprived not only of any proposed Advantage, but\r\n     even of the expense I have been at as truly as if you had plundered\r\n     me on the highway. If you are insensible of the Dishonour you have\r\n     brought on yourself by this Act, the World will not be so. However,\r\n     I leave you to reflect and consider of one of the most dishonorable\r\n     Actions you could well be guilty of.\r\n\r\n                                                           H. PELHAM.\r\n\r\n  [278] See Atlantic Monthly. April 1893, \"Some Pelham Copley Letters.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a serious charge against Revere's honor and integrity, for it\r\nseems that Pelham loaned Revere a drawing of the \"Massacre\" from which\r\nRevere made an engraving and sold copies without giving the real artist\r\ncredit for his sketch, since the Revere plate bears the inscription\r\nEngraved, Printed and Sold by Paul Revere.\r\n\r\nRevere was one of the chief actors in the tea mobs that destroyed the\r\ntea which precipitated the Revolution. The North End Caucus had, on Oct.\r\n23, 1773, declared that its members would \"oppose at peril of life and\r\nfortune the vending of any tea that might be imported by the East Indian\r\nCompany.\" A song was composed which became very popular. One of them\r\ncommenced with\r\n\r\n  \"Our Warren's there and bold Revere\r\n  With hands to do and words to cheer.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PURSUIT AND CAPTURE OF PAUL REVERE.\r\n\r\nHe and another scout, named Dawes, was captured on the road to\r\nLexington, April 19, 1775.]\r\n\r\nRevere took a prominent part in this tumultuous affair, and the next day\r\nhe was selected as the man to take the news to New York and\r\nPhiladelphia. From this time on he was the chief scout of the Boston\r\nRevolutionists. He was one of a band of thirty formed to watch the\r\nmovements of the British that had been sent to Boston after the\r\ndestruction of the tea. Finally the vigilance of these scouts was\r\nrewarded. It became apparent that something unusual was occurring in the\r\nBritish camp on the evening of April 18th, 1775, for Revere says \"On\r\nTuesday evening, the 18th, it was observed that a number of soldiers\r\nwere marching towards the bottom of the Common,\" which meant that they\r\nwere going in boats across the river to Charlestown or Cambridge,\r\ninstead of making a long march around by land. About ten o'clock Dr.\r\nWarren sent in great haste for me and begged that I would immediately\r\nset off for Lexington. I found he had sent an express by land, a Mr.\r\nWilliam Dawes.\" I then went home, took my boots and surtout, went to the\r\nnorth part of the town, where I kept a boat; two friends rowed me across\r\nCharles River. When I got into town, I met Colonel Conant and several\r\nothers. They said they had seen our signals. I told them what was\r\nacting, and went to get a horse.\" Mounted on Deacon Larkin's horse, he\r\nsaid \"I alarmed nearly every home till I got to Lexington. After I had\r\nbeen there about half an Hour, Mr. Dawes arrived, who came from Boston\r\nover the Neck. We set off for Concord.\" They had gone but a short\r\ndistance when they were taken prisoners. Revere said \"I saw four of\r\nthem, who rode up to me with their pistols in their hands, said G--d\r\nd--n you, stop, if you go an inch further you are a dead Man.\" The\r\nresult was that neither Revere nor Dawes reached Concord.\r\n\r\nOn the day following these events Revere was permanently engaged by Dr.\r\nWarren, as a scout to do outside business for the Committee of Safety.\r\nThis patriotic service had a commercial value, and the Committee in\r\nauditing the bill thought he was disposed to value his labors too\r\nhighly, for they reduced his charges from five shillings to four\r\nshillings a day.[279] In his financial dealings with the government he\r\nhardly ever failed to send in bills for work done which the authorities\r\ndeemed extravagant charges and pruned down accordingly.\r\n\r\n  [279] Paul Revere's Bills can be seen in the Archives at the State\r\n  House, Boston.\r\n\r\nMost men like Revere, somewhat above the masses, but not possessing the\r\nelements of enduring fame, are remembered by a circle of admiring and\r\nrespecting friends until they pass away, and are ultimately forgotten,\r\nfinding no place upon the pages of written history. Paul Revere was\r\nrescued from this fate by an accident, a poet's imagination of things\r\nthat never occurred. His famous ride remained unsung, if not unhonored\r\nfor eighty-eight years, or until Longfellow, in 1863 made it the text\r\nfor his Landlord's Tale in the Wayside Inn. It is to the \"poetic\r\nlicense\" of Longfellow, that most persons owe their knowledge of the\r\nfact that such a person as Revere ever existed. The poet did not mention\r\nthe name of Dawes, yet he was entitled to as much credit, for what he\r\ndid on the eve of the historic skirmish at Lexington, as Revere.\r\n\r\nPoetry and history sometimes become sadly mixed, the poet and romancist,\r\nin so far as they deal with matters of verifiable records should keep\r\ncloser to the truth, and make use of poetic license as little as\r\npossible. To be sure the poet's statement concerning the lantern, and\r\nthat Revere reached Concord was long ago shown to have been incorrect,\r\nbut its persistent virility only goes to prove that truth is not the\r\nonly thing which crushed to earth, will rise again. Very little is said\r\nby historians, concerning the Penobscot Expedition despatched in the\r\nsummer of 1779 by the Massachusetts Council against the British on the\r\ncoast of Maine. It was an episode of the Revolution that resulted in\r\ndisaster so complete, so utterly without excuse, and so thoroughly\r\ndiscreditable to American arms as to make its contemplation without\r\nfeelings of shame and humiliation impossible. An overwhelming force of\r\nColonial troops, through the clear cowardice of an admiral bearing the\r\nproud name of Saltonstall, allowed itself to be frightened into an\r\nignominious and panic-stricken desertion of its post of duty by a\r\nridiculously ill equipped enemy. The ensuing scandal besmirched\r\nreputations hitherto untarnished, and the State of Massachusetts was\r\nplunged, on account of the expedition, into a debt of eight million\r\ndollars sterling. \"To attempt to give a description of this terrible\r\nDay,\" wrote General Lovell, \"is out of my Power. It would be a fit\r\nsubject for some masterly hand to describe it in its true colors, to see\r\nfour ships pursuing seventeen Sail of Armed Vessels, nine of which were\r\nstout Ships, Transports on fire. Men of War blowing up every kind of\r\nStores on Shore, throwing about, and as much confusion as can possibly\r\nbe conceived.\"[280]\r\n\r\n  [280] Lovell's Journal, p. 105.\r\n\r\nThus did this little Garrison with three Sloops of War, by the unwearied\r\nexertions of soldiers and seamen, writes John Calef in his Journal under\r\ndate of August 14, 1779, whose bravery cannot be too much extolled,\r\nsucceed in an enterprise of great importance, against difficulties\r\napparently unsurmountable, and in a manner strongly expressive of their\r\nfaithful and spirited attachment to the interests of their King and\r\nCountry. Calef gives the total number of American ships of war, brigs\r\nand transports as 37, of which 26 were burnt and 11 captured.[281] \"The\r\nsoldiers and crew took to the woods, and singly or in squads, made their\r\nway to the Kennebec, where most of them arrived after a week's suffering\r\nfrom hunger and exposure.\"[282]\r\n\r\n  [281] The Siege of the Penobscot, etc., pp. 23, 25.\r\n\r\n  [282] Mass.

(Todds report).\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Paul Revere was in command of the artillery train,\r\nand this episode was a serious event in his life, and came near\r\nstripping him of the laurels he had won by his earlier exploits, he was\r\narrested on charges of cowardice, censured after an investigation, court\r\nmartialled, and was grudgingly acquitted, after three years persistent\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nPaul Revere's Masonic Record also has its blemishes. He received his\r\ndegrees in St. Andrews Lodge in 1760-1. He afterwards became Grand\r\nMaster. There being too many Loyalists or \"Gentry\" in St. Andrews Lodge\r\nto suit the taste of Revere, the leader of the mechanics, he and his\r\nfriends therefore withdrew from same, and started \"Rising States Lodge,\"\r\nbut it did not succeed. The members soon fell to quarrelling among\r\nthemselves. Some twenty members came together and voted the lodge out of\r\nexistence, and divided the funds of the lodge, amounting to $1,577.50\r\namong twenty-five members of the lodge, among whom was Paul Revere and\r\nhis son. This was contrary to all Masonic precedents. The funds and\r\nparaphernalia of the Lodge should have been returned to the Grand Lodge.\r\nA committee was appointed to investigate the matter. They made a very\r\nscathing report in which it said \"To divide it among members of a Lodge\r\nwhenever they think proper to dissolve this union, is making the funds\r\nan object of speculation, it is treating the noble example of departed\r\ndonors with contempt and devoting their sacred deposit to individual\r\nemoluments, it is taking bread from the hungry, It is multiplying the\r\ntears of the widow and fatherless.\"\r\n\r\nThe Grand Lodge ordered that the funds of the lodge should be devoted to\r\ncharity and a report of same printed and sent to each member of Rising\r\nStates Lodge.[283]\r\n\r\n  [283] See copy of report in \"Rising States Lodge,\" in Library of Mass.\r\n  Grand Lodge.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 WILLIAM FRANKLIN, SON OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\nWilliam Franklin, Last Royal Governor of New Jersey, was a natural son\r\nof Dr. Benjamin Franklin. He was born about 1731. His father said of\r\nhim: \"He imagined his father had got enough for him; but I have assured\r\nhim that I intend to spend what little I have myself, if it pleases God\r\nthat I live long enough; and, as he by no means wants acuteness, he can\r\nsee by my going on that I mean to be as good as my word.\" He served as\r\nPostmaster of Philadelphia, and as clerk of the House of Assembly of\r\nPennsylvania. In the French war he was a captain and gained praise for\r\nhis conduct at Ticonderoga. Before the peace, he went to England with\r\nhis father. While there, Mr. Strahan wrote Mrs. Franklin, \"Your son I\r\nreally think one of the prettiest young gentlemen I ever knew from\r\nAmerica. He seems to me to have a solidity of judgment, not very often\r\nto be met with in one of his years.\" While abroad young Franklin visited\r\nScotland and became acquainted with the celebrated Earl of Bute, who\r\nrecommended him to Lord Fairfax, who secured for him, as is said, the\r\nappointment of Governor of New Jersey, in 1763, without the solicitation\r\nof himself or his father. All intercourse between him and his father was\r\nsuspended for more than a year before the actual commencement of\r\nhostilities. He was involved in a helpless quarrel with the delegates,\r\nand the people of New Jersey. In May, 1775, in a message he sent to the\r\nAssembly he said, \"No office of honor in the power of the Crown to\r\nbestow would ever influence him to forget or neglect the duty he owed\r\nhis country, nor the most furious rage of the most intemperate zealots\r\ninduce him to swerve from the duty he owed his Majesty.\" On the 20th of\r\nMay, the day this message was transmitted, the Assembly was prorogued,\r\nand Governor Franklin never communicated with that body again. Three\r\ndays after the first Provincial Congress commenced their session at\r\nTrenton, and the Royal Government ceased, and William Livingston became\r\nFranklin's successor.\r\n\r\nCongress ordered the arrest of Governor Franklin as an enemy to his\r\ncountry. He was accordingly placed in the custody of a guard commanded\r\nby a captain who had orders to deliver him to Governor Trumball in\r\nConnecticut. He was conveyed to East Windsor, and quartered in the house\r\nof Captain Ebenezer Grant. In 1777 he requested liberty to visit his\r\nwife who was a few miles distant, and sick. This Washington refused,\r\nsaying, \"It is by no means in my power to supersede a positive\r\nResolution of Congress under which your present confinement took place.\"\r\nHis wife was born in the West Indies and it is said that she was much\r\naffected by the severity of Doctor Franklin to her husband while he was\r\na prisoner. She died in 1778 in her 49th year, and is buried in St.\r\nPaul's Church, New York. It is inscribed upon the monumental tablet\r\nerected to her memory that \"Compelled to part from the husband she\r\nloved, and at length despairing of the soothing hope of his speedy\r\nreturn, she sunk under accumulated distresses, etc.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1778, after the arrival in America of Sir Henry Clinton, an exchange\r\nwas effected and Governor Franklin was released, and went to England. In\r\nWest's picture of the Reception of the American Loyalists, by Great\r\nBritain in 1783, Governor Franklin and Sir William Pepperell are the\r\nprominent personages represented. (See page 214.)\r\n\r\nIn 1784, the father and son, after an estrangement of ten years, became\r\nreconciled to one another, for Doctor Franklin writes, \"It will be very\r\nagreeable to me, indeed nothing has ever hurt me so much, and affected\r\nme with such keen sensation, as to find myself deserted in my old age by\r\nmy only son, and not only deserted, but to find him taking up arms\r\nagainst me in a cause wherein my good fame, fortune and life were all at\r\nstake. You conceived, you say, that your duty to your king and regard\r\nfor your country required this. I ought not to blame you for differing\r\nin sentiment with me in public affairs. We are all men, subject to\r\nerrors, etc.\" In his will, dated June 23, 1789, a few months before his\r\ndecease, he showed his shrewdness and craftiness for which he was always\r\nnoted, in leaving his Nova Scotia lands to his son, the title to which\r\nwas doubtful on account of the part he took in the Revolution. He says\r\n\"I give and devise all the lands I hold or have a right to in the\r\nProvince of Nova Scotia, to hold to him, his heirs and assigns forever.\r\nI also give to him all my books and papers which he has in his\r\npossession, and all debts standing against him on my account-books,\r\nwilling that no payment for, nor restitution of the same be required of\r\nhim by my executors. The part he acted against me in the late war, which\r\nis of public notoriety, will account for my leaving him no more of an\r\nestate he endeavored to deprive me of.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Franklin continued in England during the remainder of his life.\r\nHe received a pension from the British Government of L800 per annum. His\r\npersonal estate valued at L1800, which was confiscated, the government\r\nallowed him full compensation for. He had several shares in back lands\r\nand grants and real estate in New York and New Jersey, all of which he\r\nconveyed to his father, as he was indebted to him. He died in Nov.,\r\n1813. His son, William Temple Franklin, was Secretary to Dr. Franklin,\r\nand edited his works. He died at Paris in May, 1823.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ROYAL COAT OF ARMS.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Coat of Arms embossed on the outside cover of this work is an\r\nexact reproduction of the Coat of Arms that was formerly above the\r\nGovernor's seat in the Council Chamber in the Old State House in Boston.\r\nIt was made from a photograph taken from the original in Trinity Church,\r\nSt. John, N. B., for a fuller description of same, see p. 436. The seal\r\nembossed on the outside back cover, is a reproduction of the seal of\r\n\"The Colony of the Massachusetts Bay in New England\" from which the\r\npresent seal of the State of Massachusetts is derived. It was the seal\r\nthat was used on all official documents down to the time of the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   PELHAM'S MAP OF BOSTON.\r\n\r\nThis plan was made by Henry Pelham, the half brother of Copley the\r\npainter. It was made under permission of J. Urquhart, Town Major, August\r\n28, 1775. It shows the lines about the Town and the Harbor, and is the\r\nmost important of the early maps of Boston and the one upon which all\r\nsubsequent revolutionary maps are based. It was printed in two sheets\r\npublished in London, June 2, 1777, done in aquatinta by Francis Jukes.\r\nThis copy is reproduced from the original in the Massachusetts\r\nHistorical Society's Library and is drawn on a photographic print from\r\nwhich this engraving is made.\r\n\r\n\r\n     JUDGE CHAMBERLAIN'S OPINION OF COL. THOS. GOLDTHWAITE.\r\n\r\nCol. Goldthwaite was a man of ability, unbounded enterprise, and\r\nconsiderable influence. Chamberlain in his History of Chelsea says of\r\nhim: \"Some very unfavorable accounts of Col. Goldthwaite have been\r\npublished, which I do not feel at liberty to withhold, but in referring\r\nto them suggest, first, that they were mainly written after he had\r\nbecome obnoxious as a loyalist; secondly: that his position on the\r\nPenobscot was one in which it would have been impossible to protect the\r\njust rights of the Indians against turbulent frontiersmen outside any\r\nefficient government without incurring their hostility, since their only\r\nsense of justice was their desire for exclusive possessions of lands\r\nwhich rightfully belonged to the original occupants.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGOV.

Stark in his series of histories of, and guides to, the\r\nWest Indies has assumed the role of a modern Hakluyt to intending\r\nvoyagers to the islands. He gives a clear account of their present\r\nstate, their climate, season, and \"natural commodities,\" and useful\r\ninformation as to steamers and hotels. But to this is added a well\r\nedited and illustrated history of each island, or group of islands,\r\nwhich brings the present into vivid relation with the past. Each of the\r\nbooks is interesting and suggestive and complete in itself, the present\r\npolitical and commercial prospects of the different colonies, being\r\nespecially well set out. After following Mr. Stark, who writes both with\r\nknowledge and enthusiasm, from island to island our personal choice\r\nwould fall on Trinidad as the centre and headquarters of a visit to the\r\nWest Indies. It is accessible, not expensive, and makes an admirable\r\ncentre for further voyages.--_London Spectator._\r\n\r\n\r\n                 =Stark's History and Guide to Jamaica=\r\n\r\n     =Two hundred pages, and over fifty full-page illustrations.=\r\n\r\n                        =From the Jamaica \"News.\"=\r\n\r\nJamaica has not been without literature descriptive of her charms, but\r\nthere is no book which pays her so eloquent a tribute as Stark's\r\n\"History and Guide to Jamaica.\" It is a handsome volume and one which\r\ncannot be absent from any well equipped West Indian bookshelf. Mr. Stark\r\nhails from Boston, but the works which he will leave behind will\r\nassociate him more closely with the jewels of the Caribbean Sea. Few\r\nbetter than he have appreciated to the full the dazzling beauties of the\r\nWest Indies, and few have pictured them with such graphic force. Mr.\r\nStark has not been content with skilled word-pictures in his portrayal\r\nof Jamaica. The volume is made beautiful by fifty-six exquisite\r\nfull-page photographic reproductions. These must have added very\r\nmaterially to the expense of production, but they serve to render the\r\nbook by far the best-illustrated work the island has ever possessed.\r\nThere are also a map of the West Indies, a detailed map of Jamaica and a\r\nstreet plan of Kingston, all specially engraved for the \"Guide.\"\r\n\r\nThe work which Mr. Stark has completed is one that the government of\r\nJamaica might have undertaken in an earnest effort to benefit the\r\nisland, but it could not have done it so well, nor would its labors have\r\nbeen free from the suspicion of prejudice. Mr. Stark is a stranger, an\r\nAmerican, whose unqualified praise is not biased by consideration of\r\npatriotism; and his work is likely to prove so potent a factor in the\r\nworking out of the island's salvation that the government could do no\r\nmore beneficent act than to make a present of a copy of the work to\r\nevery public library throughout the English-speaking world.\r\n\r\nThe book is full of interest from cover to cover. From the opening\r\nchapter to the last there is much to instruct, and the writing is of\r\nsuch excellence that we never wearied. There are in all nineteen\r\nchapters to the work, and the book has been handsomely printed, bound,\r\nand illustrated.--_News, Jamaica._\r\n\r\n\r\n            =Stark's Guide and History of British Guiana=\r\n\r\n                        (PALL MALL GAZETTE).\r\n\r\n\"Stark's Guide and History of British Guiana, is a continuation of a\r\nseries of works of the Guide book type, dealing with our West Indian\r\npossessions.
