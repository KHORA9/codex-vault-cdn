LIMITED\r\n1920\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT, 1920, BY LOUISE WHITFIELD CARNEGIE\r\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter retiring from active business my husband yielded to the earnest\r\nsolicitations of friends, both here and in Great Britain, and began to\r\njot down from time to time recollections of his early days. He soon\r\nfound, however, that instead of the leisure he expected, his life was\r\nmore occupied with affairs than ever before, and the writing of these\r\nmemoirs was reserved for his play-time in Scotland. For a few weeks\r\neach summer we retired to our little bungalow on the moors at\r\nAultnagar to enjoy the simple life, and it was there that Mr. Carnegie\r\ndid most of his writing. He delighted in going back to those early\r\ntimes, and as he wrote he lived them all over again. He was thus\r\nengaged in July, 1914, when the war clouds began to gather, and when\r\nthe fateful news of the 4th of August reached us, we immediately left\r\nour retreat in the hills and returned to Skibo to be more in touch\r\nwith the situation.\r\n\r\nThese memoirs ended at that time. Henceforth he was never able to\r\ninterest himself in private affairs. Many times he made the attempt to\r\ncontinue writing, but found it useless. Until then he had lived the\r\nlife of a man in middle life--and a young one at that--golfing,\r\nfishing, swimming each day, sometimes doing all three in one day.\r\nOptimist as he always was and tried to be, even in the face of the\r\nfailure of his hopes, the world disaster was too much. His heart was\r\nbroken. A severe attack of influenza followed by two serious attacks\r\nof pneumonia precipitated old age upon him.\r\n\r\nIt was said of a contemporary who passed away a few months before Mr.\r\nCarnegie that \"he never could have borne the burden of old age.\"\r\nPerhaps the most inspiring part of Mr. Carnegie's life, to those who\r\nwere privileged to know it intimately, was the way he bore his \"burden\r\nof old age.\" Always patient, considerate, cheerful, grateful for any\r\nlittle pleasure or service, never thinking of himself, but always of\r\nthe dawning of the better day, his spirit ever shone brighter and\r\nbrighter until \"he was not, for God took him.\"\r\n\r\nWritten with his own hand on the fly-leaf of his manuscript are these\r\nwords: \"It is probable that material for a small volume might be\r\ncollected from these memoirs which the public would care to read, and\r\nthat a private and larger volume might please my relatives and\r\nfriends. Much I have written from time to time may, I think, wisely be\r\nomitted. Whoever arranges these notes should be careful not to burden\r\nthe public with too much. A man with a heart as well as a head should\r\nbe chosen.\"\r\n\r\nWho, then, could so well fill this description as our friend Professor\r\nJohn C. Van Dyke? When the manuscript was shown to him, he remarked,\r\nwithout having read Mr. Carnegie's notation, \"It would be a labor of\r\nlove to prepare this for publication.\" Here, then, the choice was\r\nmutual, and the manner in which he has performed this \"labor\" proves\r\nthe wisdom of the choice--a choice made and carried out in the name of\r\na rare and beautiful friendship.\r\n\r\nLOUISE WHITFIELD CARNEGIE\r\n\r\n_New York_\r\n     _April 16, 1920_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of a man's life, especially when it is told by the man\r\nhimself, should not be interrupted by the hecklings of an editor. He\r\nshould be allowed to tell the tale in his own way, and enthusiasm,\r\neven extravagance in recitation should be received as a part of the\r\nstory. The quality of the man may underlie exuberance of spirit, as\r\ntruth may be found in apparent exaggeration. Therefore, in preparing\r\nthese chapters for publication the editor has done little more than\r\narrange the material chronologically and sequentially so that the\r\nnarrative might run on unbrokenly to the end. Some footnotes by way of\r\nexplanation, some illustrations that offer sight-help to the text,\r\nhave been added; but the narrative is the thing.\r\n\r\nThis is neither the time nor the place to characterize or eulogize the\r\nmaker of \"this strange eventful history,\" but perhaps it is worth\r\nwhile to recognize that the history really was eventful. And strange.\r\nNothing stranger ever came out of the _Arabian Nights_ than the story\r\nof this poor Scotch boy who came to America and step by step, through\r\nmany trials and triumphs, became the great steel master, built up a\r\ncolossal industry, amassed an enormous fortune, and then deliberately\r\nand systematically gave away the whole of it for the enlightenment and\r\nbetterment of mankind. Not only that. He established a gospel of\r\nwealth that can be neither ignored nor forgotten, and set a pace in\r\ndistribution that succeeding millionaires have followed as a\r\nprecedent. In the course of his career he became a nation-builder, a\r\nleader in thought, a writer, a speaker, the friend of workmen,\r\nschoolmen, and statesmen, the associate of both the lowly and the\r\nlofty. But these were merely interesting happenings in his life as\r\ncompared with his great inspirations--his distribution of wealth, his\r\npassion for world peace, and his love for mankind.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we are too near this history to see it in proper proportions,\r\nbut in the time to come it should gain in perspective and in interest.\r\nThe generations hereafter may realize the wonder of it more fully than\r\nwe of to-day. Happily it is preserved to us, and that, too, in Mr.\r\nCarnegie's own words and in his own buoyant style. It is a very\r\nmemorable record--a record perhaps the like of which we shall not look\r\nupon again.\r\n\r\nJOHN C.

I may console myself with the assurance that such a\r\nstory must interest at least a certain number of people who have known\r\nme, and that knowledge will encourage me to proceed.\r\n\r\nA book of this kind, written years ago by my friend, Judge Mellon, of\r\nPittsburgh, gave me so much pleasure that I am inclined to agree with\r\nthe wise one whose opinion I have given above; for, certainly, the\r\nstory which the Judge told has proved a source of infinite\r\nsatisfaction to his friends, and must continue to influence succeeding\r\ngenerations of his family to live life well. And not only this; to\r\nsome beyond his immediate circle it holds rank with their favorite\r\nauthors. The book contains one essential feature of value--it reveals\r\nthe man. It was written without any intention of attracting public\r\nnotice, being designed only for his family. In like manner I intend to\r\ntell my story, not as one posturing before the public, but as in the\r\nmidst of my own people and friends, tried and true, to whom I can\r\nspeak with the utmost freedom, feeling that even trifling incidents\r\nmay not be wholly destitute of interest for them.\r\n\r\nTo begin, then, I was born in Dunfermline, in the attic of the small\r\none-story house, corner of Moodie Street and Priory Lane, on the 25th\r\nof November, 1835, and, as the saying is, \"of poor but honest parents,\r\nof good kith and kin.\" Dunfermline had long been noted as the center\r\nof the damask trade in Scotland.[1] My father, William Carnegie, was a\r\ndamask weaver, the son of Andrew Carnegie after whom I was named.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Eighteenth-Century Carnegies lived at the picturesque\r\nhamlet of Patiemuir, two miles south of Dunfermline. The growing\r\nimportance of the linen industry in Dunfermline finally led the\r\nCarnegies to move to that town.]\r\n\r\nMy Grandfather Carnegie was well known throughout the district for his\r\nwit and humor, his genial nature and irrepressible spirits. He was\r\nhead of the lively ones of his day, and known far and near as the\r\nchief of their joyous club--\"Patiemuir College.\" Upon my return to\r\nDunfermline, after an absence of fourteen years, I remember being\r\napproached by an old man who had been told that I was the grandson of\r\nthe \"Professor,\" my grandfather's title among his cronies. He was the\r\nvery picture of palsied eld;\r\n\r\n    \"His nose and chin they threatened ither.\"\r\n\r\nAs he tottered across the room toward me and laid his trembling hand\r\nupon my head he said: \"And ye are the grandson o' Andra Carnegie! Eh,\r\nmon, I ha'e seen the day when your grandfaither and I could ha'e\r\nhallooed ony reasonable man oot o' his jidgment.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANDREW CARNEGIE'S BIRTHPLACE]\r\n\r\nSeveral other old people of Dunfermline told me stories of my\r\ngrandfather. Here is one of them:\r\n\r\nOne Hogmanay night[2] an old wifey, quite a character in the\r\nvillage, being surprised by a disguised face suddenly thrust in at the\r\nwindow, looked up and after a moment's pause exclaimed, \"Oh, it's jist\r\nthat daft callant Andra Carnegie.\" She was right; my grandfather at\r\nseventy-five was out frightening his old lady friends, disguised like\r\nother frolicking youngsters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The 31st of December.]\r\n\r\nI think my optimistic nature, my ability to shed trouble and to laugh\r\nthrough life, making \"all my ducks swans,\" as friends say I do, must\r\nhave been inherited from this delightful old masquerading grandfather\r\nwhose name I am proud to bear.[3] A sunny disposition is worth more\r\nthan fortune. Young people should know that it can be cultivated; that\r\nthe mind like the body can be moved from the shade into sunshine. Let\r\nus move it then. Laugh trouble away if possible, and one usually can\r\nif he be anything of a philosopher, provided that self-reproach comes\r\nnot from his own wrongdoing. That always remains. There is no washing\r\nout of these \"damned spots.\" The judge within sits in the supreme\r\ncourt and can never be cheated. Hence the grand rule of life which\r\nBurns gives:\r\n\r\n    \"Thine own reproach alone do fear.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: \"There is no sign that Andrew, though he prospered in his\r\nwooing, was specially successful in acquisition of worldly gear.\r\nOtherwise, however, he became an outstanding character not only in the\r\nvillage, but in the adjoining city and district. A 'brainy' man who\r\nread and thought for himself he became associated with the radical\r\nweavers of Dunfermline, who in Patiemuir formed a meeting-place which\r\nthey named a college (Andrew was the 'Professor' of it).\" (_Andrew\r\nCarnegie: His Dunfermline Ties and Benefactions_, by J.B. Mackie,\r\nF.J.I.)]\r\n\r\nThis motto adopted early in life has been more to me than all the\r\nsermons I ever heard, and I have heard not a few, although I may admit\r\nresemblance to my old friend Baillie Walker in my mature years. He was\r\nasked by his doctor about his sleep and replied that it was far from\r\nsatisfactory, he was very wakeful, adding with a twinkle in his eye:\r\n\"But I get a bit fine doze i' the kirk noo and then.\"\r\n\r\nOn my mother's side the grandfather was even more marked, for my\r\ngrandfather Thomas Morrison was a friend of William Cobbett, a\r\ncontributor to his \"Register,\" and in constant correspondence with\r\nhim. Even as I write, in Dunfermline old men who knew Grandfather\r\nMorrison speak of him as one of the finest orators and ablest men they\r\nhave known. He was publisher of \"The Precursor,\" a small edition it\r\nmight be said of Cobbett's \"Register,\" and thought to have been the\r\nfirst radical paper in Scotland. I have read some of his writings, and\r\nin view of the importance now given to technical education, I think\r\nthe most remarkable of them is a pamphlet which he published\r\nseventy-odd years ago entitled \"Head-ication versus Hand-ication.\" It\r\ninsists upon the importance of the latter in a manner that would\r\nreflect credit upon the strongest advocate of technical education\r\nto-day. It ends with these words, \"I thank God that in my youth I\r\nlearned to make and mend shoes.\" Cobbett published it in the\r\n\"Register\" in 1833, remarking editorially, \"One of the most valuable\r\ncommunications ever published in the 'Register' upon the subject, is\r\nthat of our esteemed friend and correspondent in Scotland, Thomas\r\nMorrison, which appears in this issue.\" So it seems I come by my\r\nscribbling propensities by inheritance--from both sides, for the\r\nCarnegies were also readers and thinkers.\r\n\r\nMy Grandfather Morrison was a born orator, a keen politician, and the\r\nhead of the advanced wing of the radical party in the district--a\r\nposition which his son, my Uncle Bailie Morrison, occupied as his\r\nsuccessor. More than one well-known Scotsman in America has called\r\nupon me, to shake hands with \"the grandson of Thomas Morrison.\" Mr.\r\nFarmer, president of the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad Company,\r\nonce said to me, \"I owe all that I have of learning and culture to the\r\ninfluence of your grandfather\"; and Ebenezer Henderson, author of the\r\nremarkable history of Dunfermline, stated that he largely owed his\r\nadvancement in life to the fortunate fact that while a boy he entered\r\nmy grandfather's service.\r\n\r\nI have not passed so far through life without receiving some\r\ncompliments, but I think nothing of a complimentary character has ever\r\npleased me so much as this from a writer in a Glasgow newspaper, who\r\nhad been a listener to a speech on Home Rule in America which I\r\ndelivered in Saint Andrew's Hall. The correspondent wrote that much\r\nwas then being said in Scotland with regard to myself and family and\r\nespecially my grandfather Thomas Morrison, and he went on to say,\r\n\"Judge my surprise when I found in the grandson on the platform, in\r\nmanner, gesture and appearance, a perfect _facsimile_ of the Thomas\r\nMorrison of old.\"\r\n\r\nMy surprising likeness to my grandfather, whom I do not remember to\r\nhave ever seen, cannot be doubted, because I remember well upon my\r\nfirst return to Dunfermline in my twenty-seventh year, while sitting\r\nupon a sofa with my Uncle Bailie Morrison, that his big black eyes\r\nfilled with tears. He could not speak and rushed out of the room\r\novercome. Returning after a time he explained that something in me now\r\nand then flashed before him his father, who would instantly vanish but\r\ncome back at intervals. Some gesture it was, but what precisely he\r\ncould not make out. My mother continually noticed in me some of my\r\ngrandfather's peculiarities. The doctrine of inherited tendencies is\r\nproved every day and hour, but how subtle is the law which transmits\r\ngesture, something as it were beyond the material body. I was deeply\r\nimpressed.\r\n\r\nMy Grandfather Morrison married Miss Hodge, of Edinburgh, a lady in\r\neducation, manners, and position, who died while the family was still\r\nyoung. At this time he was in good circumstances, a leather merchant\r\nconducting the tanning business in Dunfermline; but the peace after\r\nthe Battle of Waterloo involved him in ruin, as it did thousands; so\r\nthat while my Uncle Bailie, the eldest son, had been brought up in\r\nwhat might be termed luxury, for he had a pony to ride, the younger\r\nmembers of the family encountered other and harder days.\r\n\r\nThe second daughter, Margaret, was my mother, about whom I cannot\r\ntrust myself to speak at length. She inherited from her mother the\r\ndignity, refinement, and air of the cultivated lady. Perhaps some day\r\nI may be able to tell the world something of this heroine, but I doubt\r\nit. I feel her to be sacred to myself and not for others to know. None\r\ncould ever really know her--I alone did that. After my father's early\r\ndeath she was all my own. The dedication of my first book[4] tells the\r\nstory. It was: \"To my favorite Heroine My Mother.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _An American Four-in-Hand in Great Britain._ New York,\r\n1888.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DUNFERMLINE ABBEY]\r\n\r\nFortunate in my ancestors I was supremely so in my birthplace. Where\r\none is born is very important, for different surroundings and\r\ntraditions appeal to and stimulate different latent tendencies in the\r\nchild. Ruskin truly observes that every bright boy in Edinburgh is\r\ninfluenced by the sight of the Castle. So is the child of Dunfermline,\r\nby its noble Abbey, the Westminster of Scotland, founded early in the\r\neleventh century (1070) by Malcolm Canmore and his Queen Margaret,\r\nScotland's patron saint. The ruins of the great monastery and of\r\nthe Palace where kings were born still stand, and there, too, is\r\nPittencrieff Glen, embracing Queen Margaret's shrine and the ruins of\r\nKing Malcolm's Tower, with which the old ballad of \"Sir Patrick Spens\"\r\nbegins:\r\n\r\n    \"The King sits in Dunfermline _tower_,[5]\r\n    Drinking the bluid red wine.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _The Percy Reliques_ and _The Oxford Book of Ballads_\r\ngive \"town\" instead of \"tower\"; but Mr. Carnegie insisted that it\r\nshould be \"tower.\"]\r\n\r\nThe tomb of The Bruce is in the center of the Abbey, Saint Margaret's\r\ntomb is near, and many of the \"royal folk\" lie sleeping close around.\r\nFortunate, indeed, the child who first sees the light in that romantic\r\ntown, which occupies high ground three miles north of the Firth of\r\nForth, overlooking the sea, with Edinburgh in sight to the south, and\r\nto the north the peaks of the Ochils clearly in view. All is still\r\nredolent of the mighty past when Dunfermline was both nationally and\r\nreligiously the capital of Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe child privileged to develop amid such surroundings absorbs poetry\r\nand romance with the air he breathes, assimilates history and\r\ntradition as he gazes around. These become to him his real world in\r\nchildhood--the ideal is the ever-present real. The actual has yet to\r\ncome when, later in life, he is launched into the workaday world of\r\nstern reality. Even then, and till his last day, the early impressions\r\nremain, sometimes for short seasons disappearing perchance, but only\r\napparently driven away or suppressed. They are always rising and\r\ncoming again to the front to exert their influence, to elevate his\r\nthought and color his life. No bright child of Dunfermline can escape\r\nthe influence of the Abbey, Palace, and Glen. These touch him and set\r\nfire to the latent spark within, making him something different and\r\nbeyond what, less happily born, he would have become. Under these\r\ninspiring conditions my parents had also been born, and hence came, I\r\ndoubt not, the potency of the romantic and poetic strain which\r\npervaded both.\r\n\r\nAs my father succeeded in the weaving business we removed from Moodie\r\nStreet to a much more commodious house in Reid's Park. My father's\r\nfour or five looms occupied the lower story; we resided in the upper,\r\nwhich was reached, after a fashion common in the older Scottish\r\nhouses, by outside stairs from the pavement. It is here that my\r\nearliest recollections begin, and, strangely enough, the first trace\r\nof memory takes me back to a day when I saw a small map of America. It\r\nwas upon rollers and about two feet square. Upon this my father,\r\nmother, Uncle William, and Aunt Aitken were looking for Pittsburgh and\r\npointing out Lake Erie and Niagara. Soon after my uncle and Aunt\r\nAitken sailed for the land of promise.\r\n\r\nAt this time I remember my cousin-brother, George Lauder (\"Dod\"), and\r\nmyself were deeply impressed with the great danger overhanging us\r\nbecause a lawless flag was secreted in the garret. It had been painted\r\nto be carried, and I believe was carried by my father, or uncle, or\r\nsome other good radical of our family, in a procession during the Corn\r\nLaw agitation. There had been riots in the town and a troop of cavalry\r\nwas quartered in the Guildhall. My grandfathers and uncles on both\r\nsides, and my father, had been foremost in addressing meetings, and\r\nthe whole family circle was in a ferment.\r\n\r\nI remember as if it were yesterday being awakened during the night by\r\na tap at the back window by men who had come to inform my parents that\r\nmy uncle, Bailie Morrison, had been thrown into jail because he had\r\ndared to hold a meeting which had been forbidden. The sheriff with the\r\naid of the soldiers had arrested him a few miles from the town where\r\nthe meeting had been held, and brought him into the town during the\r\nnight, followed by an immense throng of people.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: At the opening of the Lauder Technical School in October,\r\n1880, nearly half a century after the disquieting scenes of 1842, Mr.\r\nCarnegie thus recalled the shock which was given to his boy mind: \"One\r\nof my earliest recollections is that of being wakened in the darkness\r\nto be told that my Uncle Morrison was in jail. Well, it is one of the\r\nproudest boasts I can make to-day to be able to say that I had an\r\nuncle who was in jail. But, ladies and gentlemen, my uncle went to\r\njail to vindicate the rights of public assembly.\" (Mackie.)]\r\n\r\nSerious trouble was feared, for the populace threatened to rescue him,\r\nand, as we learned afterwards, he had been induced by the provost of\r\nthe town to step forward to a window overlooking the High Street and\r\nbeg the people to retire. This he did, saying: \"If there be a friend\r\nof the good cause here to-night, let him fold his arms.\" They did so.\r\nAnd then, after a pause, he said, \"Now depart in peace!\"[7] My uncle,\r\nlike all our family, was a moral-force man and strong for obedience to\r\nlaw, but radical to the core and an intense admirer of the American\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: \"The Crown agents wisely let the proceedings lapse....\r\nMr. Morrison was given a gratifying assurance of the appreciation of\r\nhis fellow citizens by his election to the Council and his elevation\r\nto the Magisterial Bench, followed shortly after by his appointment to\r\nthe office of Burgh Chamberlain. The patriotic reformer whom the\r\ncriminal authorities endeavored to convict as a law-breaker became by\r\nthe choice of his fellow citizens a Magistrate, and was further given\r\na certificate for trustworthiness and integrity.\" (Mackie.)]\r\n\r\nOne may imagine when all this was going on in public how bitter were\r\nthe words that passed from one to the other in private. The\r\ndenunciations of monarchical and aristocratic government, of privilege\r\nin all its forms, the grandeur of the republican system, the\r\nsuperiority of America, a land peopled by our own race, a home for\r\nfreemen in which every citizen's privilege was every man's\r\nright--these were the exciting themes upon which I was nurtured. As a\r\nchild I could have slain king, duke, or lord, and considered their\r\ndeaths a service to the state and hence an heroic act.\r\n\r\nSuch is the influence of childhood's earliest associations that it was\r\nlong before I could trust myself to speak respectfully of any\r\nprivileged class or person who had not distinguished himself in some\r\ngood way and therefore earned the right to public respect. There was\r\nstill the sneer behind for mere pedigree--\"he is nothing, has done\r\nnothing, only an accident, a fraud strutting in borrowed plumes; all\r\nhe has to his account is the accident of birth; the most fruitful part\r\nof his family, as with the potato, lies underground.\" I wondered that\r\nintelligent men could live where another human being was born to a\r\nprivilege which was not also their birthright. I was never tired of\r\nquoting the only words which gave proper vent to my indignation:\r\n\r\n    \"There was a Brutus once that would have brooked\r\n    Th' eternal devil to keep his state in Rome\r\n    As easily as a king.\"\r\n\r\nBut then kings were kings, not mere shadows. All this was inherited,\r\nof course. I only echoed what I heard at home.\r\n\r\nDunfermline has long been renowned as perhaps the most radical town in\r\nthe Kingdom, although I know Paisley has claims. This is all the more\r\ncreditable to the cause of radicalism because in the days of which I\r\nspeak the population of Dunfermline was in large part composed of men\r\nwho were small manufacturers, each owning his own loom or looms. They\r\nwere not tied down to regular hours, their labors being piece work.\r\nThey got webs from the larger manufacturers and the weaving was done\r\nat home.\r\n\r\nThese were times of intense political excitement, and there was\r\nfrequently seen throughout the entire town, for a short time after the\r\nmidday meal, small groups of men with their aprons girt about them\r\ndiscussing affairs of state. The names of Hume, Cobden, and Bright\r\nwere upon every one's tongue. I was often attracted, small as I was,\r\nto these circles and was an earnest listener to the conversation,\r\nwhich was wholly one-sided. The generally accepted conclusion was that\r\nthere must be a change. Clubs were formed among the townsfolk, and the\r\nLondon newspapers were subscribed for. The leading editorials were\r\nread every evening to the people, strangely enough, from one of the\r\npulpits of the town. My uncle, Bailie Morrison, was often the reader,\r\nand, as the articles were commented upon by him and others after being\r\nread, the meetings were quite exciting.\r\n\r\nThese political meetings were of frequent occurrence, and, as might be\r\nexpected, I was as deeply interested as any of the family and attended\r\nmany. One of my uncles or my father was generally to be heard. I\r\nremember one evening my father addressed a large outdoor meeting in\r\nthe Pends. I had wedged my way in under the legs of the hearers, and\r\nat one cheer louder than all the rest I could not restrain my\r\nenthusiasm. Looking up to the man under whose legs I had found\r\nprotection I informed him that was my father speaking. He lifted me on\r\nhis shoulder and kept me there.\r\n\r\nTo another meeting I was taken by my father to hear John Bright, who\r\nspoke in favor of J.B. Smith as the Liberal candidate for the Stirling\r\nBurghs. I made the criticism at home that Mr. Bright did not speak\r\ncorrectly, as he said \"men\" when he meant \"maan.\" He did not give the\r\nbroad _a_ we were accustomed to in Scotland. It is not to be wondered\r\nat that, nursed amid such surroundings, I developed into a violent\r\nyoung Republican whose motto was \"death to privilege.\" At that time I\r\ndid not know what privilege meant, but my father did.\r\n\r\nOne of my Uncle Lauder's best stories was about this same J.B. Smith,\r\nthe friend of John Bright, who was standing for Parliament in\r\nDunfermline. Uncle was a member of his Committee and all went well\r\nuntil it was proclaimed that Smith was a \"Unitawrian.\" The district\r\nwas placarded with the enquiry: Would you vote for a \"Unitawrian\"? It\r\nwas serious. The Chairman of Smith's Committee in the village of\r\nCairney Hill, a blacksmith, was reported as having declared he never\r\nwould. Uncle drove over to remonstrate with him. They met in the\r\nvillage tavern over a gill:\r\n\r\n\"Man, I canna vote for a Unitawrian,\" said the Chairman.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said my uncle, \"Maitland [the opposing candidate] is a\r\nTrinitawrian.\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn; that's waur,\" was the response.\r\n\r\nAnd the blacksmith voted right. Smith won by a small majority.\r\n\r\nThe change from hand-loom to steam-loom weaving was disastrous to our\r\nfamily. My father did not recognize the impending revolution, and was\r\nstruggling under the old system. His looms sank greatly in value, and\r\nit became necessary for that power which never failed in any\r\nemergency--my mother--to step forward and endeavor to repair the\r\nfamily fortune. She opened a small shop in Moodie Street and\r\ncontributed to the revenues which, though slender, nevertheless at\r\nthat time sufficed to keep us in comfort and \"respectable.\"\r\n\r\nI remember that shortly after this I began to learn what poverty\r\nmeant. Dreadful days came when my father took the last of his webs to\r\nthe great manufacturer, and I saw my mother anxiously awaiting his\r\nreturn to know whether a new web was to be obtained or that a period\r\nof idleness was upon us. It was burnt into my heart then that my\r\nfather, though neither \"abject, mean, nor vile,\" as Burns has it, had\r\nnevertheless to\r\n\r\n    \"Beg a brother of the earth\r\n    To give him leave to toil.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then and there came the resolve that I would cure that when I got\r\nto be a man. We were not, however, reduced to anything like poverty\r\ncompared with many of our neighbors. I do not know to what lengths of\r\nprivation my mother would not have gone that she might see her two\r\nboys wearing large white collars, and trimly dressed.\r\n\r\nIn an incautious moment my parents had promised that I should never be\r\nsent to school until I asked leave to go. This promise I afterward\r\nlearned began to give them considerable uneasiness because as I grew\r\nup I showed no disposition to ask. The schoolmaster, Mr. Robert\r\nMartin, was applied to and induced to take some notice of me. He took\r\nme upon an excursion one day with some of my companions who attended\r\nschool, and great relief was experienced by my parents when one day\r\nsoon afterward I came and asked for permission to go to Mr. Martin's\r\nschool.[8] I need not say the permission was duly granted. I had then\r\nentered upon my eighth year, which subsequent experience leads me to\r\nsay is quite early enough for any child to begin attending school.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: It was known as Rolland School.]\r\n\r\nThe school was a perfect delight to me, and if anything occurred which\r\nprevented my attendance I was unhappy. This happened every now and\r\nthen because my morning duty was to bring water from the well at the\r\nhead of Moodie Street. The supply was scanty and irregular. Sometimes\r\nit was not allowed to run until late in the morning and a score of old\r\nwives were sitting around, the turn of each having been previously\r\nsecured through the night by placing a worthless can in the line.\r\nThis, as might be expected, led to numerous contentions in which I\r\nwould not be put down even by these venerable old dames. I earned the\r\nreputation of being \"an awfu' laddie.\" In this way I probably\r\ndeveloped the strain of argumentativeness, or perhaps combativeness,\r\nwhich has always remained with me.\r\n\r\nIn the performance of these duties I was often late for school, but\r\nthe master, knowing the cause, forgave the lapses. In the same\r\nconnection I may mention that I had often the shop errands to run\r\nafter school, so that in looking back upon my life I have the\r\nsatisfaction of feeling that I became useful to my parents even at the\r\nearly age of ten. Soon after that the accounts of the various people\r\nwho dealt with the shop were entrusted to my keeping so that I became\r\nacquainted, in a small way, with business affairs even in childhood.\r\n\r\nOne cause of misery there was, however, in my school experience. The\r\nboys nicknamed me \"Martin's pet,\" and sometimes called out that\r\ndreadful epithet to me as I passed along the street. I did not know\r\nall that it meant, but it seemed to me a term of the utmost\r\nopprobrium, and I know that it kept me from responding as freely as I\r\nshould otherwise have done to that excellent teacher, my only\r\nschoolmaster, to whom I owe a debt of gratitude which I regret I never\r\nhad opportunity to do more than acknowledge before he died.\r\n\r\nI may mention here a man whose influence over me cannot be\r\noverestimated, my Uncle Lauder, George Lauder's father.[9] My father\r\nwas necessarily constantly at work in the loom shop and had little\r\nleisure to bestow upon me through the day. My uncle being a shopkeeper\r\nin the High Street was not thus tied down. Note the location, for this\r\nwas among the shopkeeping aristocracy, and high and varied degrees of\r\naristocracy there were even among shopkeepers in Dunfermline. Deeply\r\naffected by my Aunt Seaton's death, which occurred about the beginning\r\nof my school life, he found his chief solace in the companionship of\r\nhis only son, George, and myself. He possessed an extraordinary gift\r\nof dealing with children and taught us many things. Among others I\r\nremember how he taught us British history by imagining each of the\r\nmonarchs in a certain place upon the walls of the room performing the\r\nact for which he was well known. Thus for me King John sits to this\r\nday above the mantelpiece signing the Magna Charta, and Queen Victoria\r\nis on the back of the door with her children on her knee.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The Lauder Technical College given by Mr. Carnegie to\r\nDunfermline was named in honor of this uncle, George Lauder.]\r\n\r\nIt may be taken for granted that the omission which, years after, I\r\nfound in the Chapter House at Westminster Abbey was fully supplied in\r\nour list of monarchs. A slab in a small chapel at Westminster says\r\nthat the body of Oliver Cromwell was removed from there. In the list\r\nof the monarchs which I learned at my uncle's knee the grand\r\nrepublican monarch appeared writing his message to the Pope of Rome,\r\ninforming His Holiness that \"if he did not cease persecuting the\r\nProtestants the thunder of Great Britain's cannon would be heard in\r\nthe Vatican.\" It is needless to say that the estimate we formed of\r\nCromwell was that he was worth them \"a' thegither.\"\r\n\r\nIt was from my uncle I learned all that I know of the early history of\r\nScotland--of Wallace and Bruce and Burns, of Blind Harry's history, of\r\nScott, Ramsey, Tannahill, Hogg, and Fergusson. I can truly say in the\r\nwords of Burns that there was then and there created in me a vein of\r\nScottish prejudice (or patriotism) which will cease to exist only with\r\nlife. Wallace, of course, was our hero. Everything heroic centered in\r\nhim. Sad was the day when a wicked big boy at school told me that\r\nEngland was far larger than Scotland. I went to the uncle, who had the\r\nremedy.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, Naig; if Scotland were rolled out flat as England,\r\nScotland would be the larger, but would you have the Highlands rolled\r\ndown?\"\r\n\r\nOh, never! There was balm in Gilead for the wounded young patriot.\r\nLater the greater population of England was forced upon me, and again\r\nto the uncle I went.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Naig, seven to one, but there were more than that odds against\r\nus at Bannockburn.\" And again there was joy in my heart--joy that\r\nthere were more English men there since the glory was the greater.\r\n\r\nThis is something of a commentary upon the truth that war breeds war,\r\nthat every battle sows the seeds of future battles, and that thus\r\nnations become traditional enemies. The experience of American boys is\r\nthat of the Scotch. They grow up to read of Washington and Valley\r\nForge, of Hessians hired to kill Americans, and they come to hate the\r\nvery name of Englishman. Such was my experience with my American\r\nnephews. Scotland was all right, but England that had fought Scotland\r\nwas the wicked partner. Not till they became men was the prejudice\r\neradicated, and even yet some of it may linger.\r\n\r\nUncle Lauder has told me since that he often brought people into the\r\nroom assuring them that he could make \"Dod\" (George Lauder) and me\r\nweep, laugh, or close our little fists ready to fight--in short, play\r\nupon all our moods through the influence of poetry and song. The\r\nbetrayal of Wallace was his trump card which never failed to cause our\r\nlittle hearts to sob, a complete breakdown being the invariable\r\nresult. Often as he told the story it never lost its hold. No doubt it\r\nreceived from time to time new embellishments. My uncle's stories\r\nnever wanted \"the hat and the stick\" which Scott gave his. How\r\nwonderful is the influence of a hero upon children!\r\n\r\nI spent many hours and evenings in the High Street with my uncle and\r\n\"Dod,\" and thus began a lifelong brotherly alliance between the latter\r\nand myself. \"Dod\" and \"Naig\" we always were in the family. I could not\r\nsay \"George\" in infancy and he could not get more than \"Naig\" out of\r\nCarnegie, and it has always been \"Dod\" and \"Naig\" with us. No other\r\nnames would mean anything.\r\n\r\nThere were two roads by which to return from my uncle's house in the\r\nHigh Street to my home in Moodie Street at the foot of the town, one\r\nalong the eerie churchyard of the Abbey among the dead, where there\r\nwas no light; and the other along the lighted streets by way of the\r\nMay Gate. When it became necessary for me to go home, my uncle, with a\r\nwicked pleasure, would ask which way I was going. Thinking what\r\nWallace would do, I always replied I was going by the Abbey. I have\r\nthe satisfaction of believing that never, not even upon one occasion,\r\ndid I yield to the temptation to take the other turn and follow the\r\nlamps at the junction of the May Gate. I often passed along that\r\nchurchyard and through the dark arch of the Abbey with my heart in my\r\nmouth. Trying to whistle and keep up my courage, I would plod through\r\nthe darkness, falling back in all emergencies upon the thought of what\r\nWallace would have done if he had met with any foe, natural or\r\nsupernatural.\r\n\r\nKing Robert the Bruce never got justice from my cousin or myself in\r\nchildhood. It was enough for us that he was a king while Wallace was\r\nthe man of the people. Sir John Graham was our second. The intensity\r\nof a Scottish boy's patriotism, reared as I was, constitutes a real\r\nforce in his life to the very end. If the source of my stock of that\r\nprime article--courage--were studied, I am sure the final analysis\r\nwould find it founded upon Wallace, the hero of Scotland. It is a\r\ntower of strength for a boy to have a hero.\r\n\r\nIt gave me a pang to find when I reached America that there was any\r\nother country which pretended to have anything to be proud of. What\r\nwas a country without Wallace, Bruce, and Burns? I find in the\r\nuntraveled Scotsman of to-day something still of this feeling. It\r\nremains for maturer years and wider knowledge to tell us that every\r\nnation has its heroes, its romance, its traditions, and its\r\nachievements; and while the true Scotsman will not find reason in\r\nafter years to lower the estimate he has formed of his own country and\r\nof its position even among the larger nations of the earth, he will\r\nfind ample reason to raise his opinion of other nations because they\r\nall have much to be proud of--quite enough to stimulate their sons so\r\nto act their parts as not to disgrace the land that gave them birth.\r\n\r\nIt was years before I could feel that the new land could be anything\r\nbut a temporary abode. My heart was in Scotland. I resembled Principal\r\nPeterson's little boy who, when in Canada, in reply to a question,\r\nsaid he liked Canada \"very well for a visit, but he could never live\r\nso far away from the remains of Bruce and Wallace.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nDUNFERMLINE AND AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\nMy good Uncle Lauder justly set great value upon recitation in\r\neducation, and many were the pennies which Dod and I received for\r\nthis. In our little frocks or shirts, our sleeves rolled up, paper\r\nhelmets and blackened faces, with laths for swords, my cousin and\r\nmyself were kept constantly reciting Norval and Glenalvon, Roderick\r\nDhu and James Fitz-James to our schoolmates and often to the older\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nI remember distinctly that in the celebrated dialogue between Norval\r\nand Glenalvon we had some qualms about repeating the phrase,--\"and\r\nfalse as _hell_.\" At first we made a slight cough over the\r\nobjectionable word which always created amusement among the\r\nspectators. It was a great day for us when my uncle persuaded us that\r\nwe could say \"hell\" without swearing. I am afraid we practiced it very\r\noften. I always played the part of Glenalvon and made a great mouthful\r\nof the word. It had for me the wonderful fascination attributed to\r\nforbidden fruit. I can well understand the story of Marjory Fleming,\r\nwho being cross one morning when Walter Scott called and asked how she\r\nwas, answered:\r\n\r\n\"I am very cross this morning, Mr. Scott. I just want to say 'damn'\r\n[with a swing], but I winna.\"\r\n\r\nThereafter the expression of the one fearful word was a great point.\r\nMinisters could say \"damnation\" in the pulpit without sin, and so we,\r\ntoo, had full range on \"hell\" in recitation. Another passage made a\r\ndeep impression. In the fight between Norval and Glenalvon, Norval\r\nsays, \"When we contend again our strife is mortal.\" Using these words\r\nin an article written for the \"North American Review\" in 1897, my\r\nuncle came across them and immediately sat down and wrote me from\r\nDunfermline that he knew where I had found the words. He was the only\r\nman living who did.\r\n\r\nMy power to memorize must have been greatly strengthened by the mode\r\nof teaching adopted by my uncle. I cannot name a more important means\r\nof benefiting young people than encouraging them to commit favorite\r\npieces to memory and recite them often. Anything which pleased me I\r\ncould learn with a rapidity which surprised partial friends. I could\r\nmemorize anything whether it pleased me or not, but if it did not\r\nimpress me strongly it passed away in a few hours.\r\n\r\nOne of the trials of my boy's life at school in Dunfermline was\r\ncommitting to memory two double verses of the Psalms which I had to\r\nrecite daily. My plan was not to look at the psalm until I had started\r\nfor school. It was not more than five or six minutes' slow walk, but I\r\ncould readily master the task in that time, and, as the psalm was the\r\nfirst lesson, I was prepared and passed through the ordeal\r\nsuccessfully. Had I been asked to repeat the psalm thirty minutes\r\nafterwards the attempt would, I fear, have ended in disastrous\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nThe first penny I ever earned or ever received from any person beyond\r\nthe family circle was one from my school-teacher, Mr. Martin, for\r\nrepeating before the school Burns's poem, \"Man was made to Mourn.\" In\r\nwriting this I am reminded that in later years, dining with Mr. John\r\nMorley in London, the conversation turned upon the life of Wordsworth,\r\nand Mr. Morley said he had been searching his Burns for the poem to\r\n\"Old Age,\" so much extolled by him, which he had not been able to find\r\nunder that title. I had the pleasure of repeating part of it to him.\r\nHe promptly handed me a second penny. Ah, great as Morley is, he\r\nwasn't my school-teacher, Mr. Martin--the first \"great\" man I ever\r\nknew. Truly great was he to me. But a hero surely is \"Honest John\"\r\nMorley.\r\n\r\nIn religious matters we were not much hampered. While other boys and\r\ngirls at school were compelled to learn the Shorter Catechism, Dod and\r\nI, by some arrangement the details of which I never clearly\r\nunderstood, were absolved. All of our family connections, Morrisons\r\nand Lauders, were advanced in their theological as in their political\r\nviews, and had objections to the catechism, I have no doubt. We had\r\nnot one orthodox Presbyterian in our family circle. My father, Uncle\r\nand Aunt Aitken, Uncle Lauder, and also my Uncle Carnegie, had fallen\r\naway from the tenets of Calvinism. At a later day most of them found\r\nrefuge for a time in the doctrines of Swedenborg. My mother was always\r\nreticent upon religious subjects. She never mentioned these to me nor\r\ndid she attend church, for she had no servant in those early days and\r\ndid all the housework, including cooking our Sunday dinner. A great\r\nreader, always, Channing the Unitarian was in those days her special\r\ndelight. She was a marvel!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANDREW CARNEGIE'S MOTHER]\r\n\r\nDuring my childhood the atmosphere around me was in a state of violent\r\ndisturbance in matters theological as well as political. Along with\r\nthe most advanced ideas which were being agitated in the political\r\nworld--the death of privilege, the equality of the citizen,\r\nRepublicanism--I heard many disputations upon theological subjects\r\nwhich the impressionable child drank in to an extent quite unthought\r\nof by his elders. I well remember that the stern doctrines of\r\nCalvinism lay as a terrible nightmare upon me, but that state of mind\r\nwas soon over, owing to the influences of which I have spoken. I\r\ngrew up treasuring within me the fact that my father had risen and\r\nleft the Presbyterian Church one day when the minister preached the\r\ndoctrine of infant damnation. This was shortly after I had made my\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nFather could not stand it and said: \"If that be your religion and that\r\nyour God, I seek a better religion and a nobler God.\" He left the\r\nPresbyterian Church never to return, but he did not cease to attend\r\nvarious other churches. I saw him enter the closet every morning to\r\npray and that impressed me. He was indeed a saint and always remained\r\ndevout. All sects became to him as agencies for good. He had\r\ndiscovered that theologies were many, but religion was one. I was\r\nquite satisfied that my father knew better than the minister, who\r\npictured not the Heavenly Father, but the cruel avenger of the Old\r\nTestament--an \"Eternal Torturer\" as Andrew D. White ventures to call\r\nhim in his autobiography. Fortunately this conception of the Unknown\r\nis now largely of the past.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief enjoyments of my childhood was the keeping of pigeons\r\nand rabbits. I am grateful every time I think of the trouble my father\r\ntook to build a suitable house for these pets. Our home became\r\nheadquarters for my young companions. My mother was always looking to\r\nhome influences as the best means of keeping her two boys in the right\r\npath. She used to say that the first step in this direction was to\r\nmake home pleasant; and there was nothing she and my father would not\r\ndo to please us and the neighbors' children who centered about us.\r\n\r\nMy first business venture was securing my companions' services for a\r\nseason as an employer, the compensation being that the young rabbits,\r\nwhen such came, should be named after them. The Saturday holiday was\r\ngenerally spent by my flock in gathering food for the rabbits. My\r\nconscience reproves me to-day, looking back, when I think of the hard\r\nbargain I drove with my young playmates, many of whom were content to\r\ngather dandelions and clover for a whole season with me, conditioned\r\nupon this unique reward--the poorest return ever made to labor. Alas!\r\nwhat else had I to offer them! Not a penny.\r\n\r\nI treasure the remembrance of this plan as the earliest evidence of\r\norganizing power upon the development of which my material success in\r\nlife has hung--a success not to be attributed to what I have known or\r\ndone myself, but to the faculty of knowing and choosing others who did\r\nknow better than myself. Precious knowledge this for any man to\r\npossess. I did not understand steam machinery, but I tried to\r\nunderstand that much more complicated piece of mechanism--man.\r\nStopping at a small Highland inn on our coaching trip in 1898, a\r\ngentleman came forward and introduced himself. He was Mr. MacIntosh,\r\nthe great furniture manufacturer of Scotland--a fine character as I\r\nfound out afterward. He said he had ventured to make himself known as\r\nhe was one of the boys who had gathered, and sometimes he feared\r\n\"conveyed,\" spoil for the rabbits, and had \"one named after him.\" It\r\nmay be imagined how glad I was to meet him--the only one of the rabbit\r\nboys I have met in after-life. I hope to keep his friendship to the\r\nlast and see him often. [As I read this manuscript to-day, December 1,\r\n1913, I have a very precious note from him, recalling old times when\r\nwe were boys together. He has a reply by this time that will warm his\r\nheart as his note did mine.]\r\n\r\nWith the introduction and improvement of steam machinery, trade grew\r\nworse and worse in Dunfermline for the small manufacturers, and at\r\nlast a letter was written to my mother's two sisters in Pittsburgh\r\nstating that the idea of our going to them was seriously\r\nentertained--not, as I remember hearing my parents say, to benefit\r\ntheir own condition, but for the sake of their two young sons.\r\nSatisfactory letters were received in reply. The decision was taken to\r\nsell the looms and furniture by auction. And my father's sweet voice\r\nsang often to mother, brother, and me:\r\n\r\n    \"To the West, to the West, to the land of the free,\r\n    Where the mighty Missouri rolls down to the sea;\r\n    Where a man is a man even though he must toil\r\n    And the poorest may gather the fruits of the soil.\"\r\n\r\nThe proceeds of the sale were most disappointing. The looms brought\r\nhardly anything, and the result was that twenty pounds more were\r\nneeded to enable the family to pay passage to America. Here let me\r\nrecord an act of friendship performed by a lifelong companion of my\r\nmother--who always attracted stanch friends because she was so stanch\r\nherself--Mrs. Henderson, by birth Ella Ferguson, the name by which she\r\nwas known in our family. She boldly ventured to advance the needful\r\ntwenty pounds, my Uncles Lauder and Morrison guaranteeing repayment.\r\nUncle Lauder also lent his aid and advice, managing all the details\r\nfor us, and on the 17th day of May, 1848, we left Dunfermline. My\r\nfather's age was then forty-three, my mother's thirty-three. I was in\r\nmy thirteenth year, my brother Tom in his fifth year--a beautiful\r\nwhite-haired child with lustrous black eyes, who everywhere attracted\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nI had left school forever, with the exception of one winter's\r\nnight-schooling in America, and later a French night-teacher for a\r\ntime, and, strange to say, an elocutionist from whom I learned how to\r\ndeclaim. I could read, write, and cipher, and had begun the study of\r\nalgebra and of Latin. A letter written to my Uncle Lauder during the\r\nvoyage, and since returned, shows that I was then a better penman than\r\nnow. I had wrestled with English grammar, and knew as little of what\r\nit was designed to teach as children usually do. I had read little\r\nexcept about Wallace, Bruce, and Burns; but knew many familiar pieces\r\nof poetry by heart. I should add to this the fairy tales of childhood,\r\nand especially the \"Arabian Nights,\" by which I was carried into a new\r\nworld. I was in dreamland as I devoured those stories.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the day we started from beloved Dunfermline, in the\r\nomnibus that ran upon the coal railroad to Charleston, I remember that\r\nI stood with tearful eyes looking out of the window until Dunfermline\r\nvanished from view, the last structure to fade being the grand and\r\nsacred old Abbey. During my first fourteen years of absence my thought\r\nwas almost daily, as it was that morning, \"When shall I see you\r\nagain?\" Few days passed in which I did not see in my mind's eye the\r\ntalismanic letters on the Abbey tower--\"King Robert The Bruce.\" All my\r\nrecollections of childhood, all I knew of fairyland, clustered around\r\nthe old Abbey and its curfew bell, which tolled at eight o'clock every\r\nevening and was the signal for me to run to bed before it stopped. I\r\nhave referred to that bell in my \"American Four-in-Hand in\r\nBritain\"[10] when passing the Abbey and I may as well quote from it\r\nnow:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _An American Four-in-Hand in Britain_. New York, 1886.]\r\n\r\n     As we drove down the Pends I was standing on the front seat\r\n     of the coach with Provost Walls, when I heard the first toll\r\n     of the Abbey bell, tolled in honor of my mother and myself.\r\n     My knees sank from under me, the tears came rushing before I\r\n     knew it, and I turned round to tell the Provost that I must\r\n     give in. For a moment I felt as if I were about to faint.\r\n     Fortunately I saw that there was no crowd before us for a\r\n     little distance. I had time to regain control, and biting my\r\n     lips till they actually bled, I murmured to myself, \"No\r\n     matter, keep cool, you must go on\"; but never can there come\r\n     to my ears on earth, nor enter so deep into my soul, a sound\r\n     that shall haunt and subdue me with its sweet, gracious,\r\n     melting power as that did.\r\n\r\n     By that curfew bell I had been laid in my little couch to\r\n     sleep the sleep of childish innocence. Father and mother,\r\n     sometimes the one, sometimes the other, had told me as they\r\n     bent lovingly over me night after night, what that bell said\r\n     as it tolled. Many good words has that bell spoken to me\r\n     through their translations. No wrong thing did I do through\r\n     the day which that voice from all I knew of heaven and the\r\n     great Father there did not tell me kindly about ere I sank\r\n     to sleep, speaking the words so plainly that I knew that the\r\n     power that moved it had seen all and was not angry, never\r\n     angry, never, but so very, _very_ sorry. Nor is that bell\r\n     dumb to me to-day when I hear its voice. It still has its\r\n     message, and now it sounded to welcome back the exiled\r\n     mother and son under its precious care again.\r\n\r\n     The world has not within its power to devise, much less to\r\n     bestow upon us, such reward as that which the Abbey bell\r\n     gave when it tolled in our honor. But my brother Tom should\r\n     have been there also; this was the thought that came. He,\r\n     too, was beginning to know the wonders of that bell ere we\r\n     were away to the newer land.\r\n\r\n     Rousseau wished to die to the strains of sweet music. Could\r\n     I choose my accompaniment, I could wish to pass into the dim\r\n     beyond with the tolling of the Abbey bell sounding in my\r\n     ears, telling me of the race that had been run, and calling\r\n     me, as it had called the little white-haired child, for the\r\n     last time--_to sleep_.\r\n\r\nI have had many letters from readers speaking of this passage in my\r\nbook, some of the writers going so far as to say that tears fell as\r\nthey read. It came from the heart and perhaps that is why it reached\r\nthe hearts of others.\r\n\r\nWe were rowed over in a small boat to the Edinburgh steamer in the\r\nFirth of Forth. As I was about to be taken from the small boat to the\r\nsteamer, I rushed to Uncle Lauder and clung round his neck, crying\r\nout: \"I cannot leave you! I cannot leave you!\" I was torn from him by\r\na kind sailor who lifted me up on the deck of the steamer. Upon my\r\nreturn visit to Dunfermline this dear old fellow, when he came to see\r\nme, told me it was the saddest parting he had ever witnessed.\r\n\r\nWe sailed from the Broomielaw of Glasgow in the 800-ton sailing ship\r\nWiscasset. During the seven weeks of the voyage, I came to know the\r\nsailors quite well, learned the names of the ropes, and was able to\r\ndirect the passengers to answer the call of the boatswain, for the\r\nship being undermanned, the aid of the passengers was urgently\r\nrequired. In consequence I was invited by the sailors to participate\r\non Sundays, in the one delicacy of the sailors' mess, plum duff. I\r\nleft the ship with sincere regret.\r\n\r\nThe arrival at New York was bewildering. I had been taken to see the\r\nQueen at Edinburgh, but that was the extent of my travels before\r\nemigrating. Glasgow we had not time to see before we sailed. New York\r\nwas the first great hive of human industry among the inhabitants of\r\nwhich I had mingled, and the bustle and excitement of it overwhelmed\r\nme. The incident of our stay in New York which impressed me most\r\noccurred while I was walking through Bowling Green at Castle Garden. I\r\nwas caught up in the arms of one of the Wiscasset sailors, Robert\r\nBarryman, who was decked out in regular Jackashore fashion, with blue\r\njacket and white trousers. I thought him the most beautiful man I had\r\never seen.\r\n\r\nHe took me to a refreshment stand and ordered a glass of sarsaparilla\r\nfor me, which I drank with as much relish as if it were the nectar of\r\nthe gods. To this day nothing that I have ever seen of the kind rivals\r\nthe image which remains in my mind of the gorgeousness of the highly\r\nornamented brass vessel out of which that nectar came foaming. Often\r\nas I have passed the identical spot I see standing there the old\r\nwoman's sarsaparilla stand, and I marvel what became of the dear old\r\nsailor. I have tried to trace him, but in vain, hoping that if found\r\nhe might be enjoying a ripe old age, and that it might be in my power\r\nto add to the pleasure of his declining years. He was my ideal Tom\r\nBowling, and when that fine old song is sung I always see as the \"form\r\nof manly beauty\" my dear old friend Barryman. Alas! ere this he's gone\r\naloft. Well; by his kindness on the voyage he made one boy his devoted\r\nfriend and admirer.\r\n\r\nWe knew only Mr. and Mrs. Sloane in New York--parents of the\r\nwell-known John, Willie, and Henry Sloane. Mrs. Sloane (Euphemia\r\nDouglas) was my mother's companion in childhood in Dunfermline. Mr.\r\nSloane and my father had been fellow weavers. We called upon them and\r\nwere warmly welcomed. It was a genuine pleasure when Willie, his son,\r\nbought ground from me in 1900 opposite our New York residence for his\r\ntwo married daughters so that our children of the third generation\r\nbecame playmates as our mothers were in Scotland.\r\n\r\nMy father was induced by emigration agents in New York to take the\r\nErie Canal by way of Buffalo and Lake Erie to Cleveland, and thence\r\ndown the canal to Beaver--a journey which then lasted three weeks,\r\nand is made to-day by rail in ten hours. There was no railway\r\ncommunication then with Pittsburgh, nor indeed with any western town.\r\nThe Erie Railway was under construction and we saw gangs of men at\r\nwork upon it as we traveled. Nothing comes amiss to youth, and I look\r\nback upon my three weeks as a passenger upon the canal-boat with\r\nunalloyed pleasure. All that was disagreeable in my experience has\r\nlong since faded from recollection, excepting the night we were\r\ncompelled to remain upon the wharf-boat at Beaver waiting for the\r\nsteamboat to take us up the Ohio to Pittsburgh. This was our first\r\nintroduction to the mosquito in all its ferocity. My mother suffered\r\nso severely that in the morning she could hardly see. We were all\r\nfrightful sights, but I do not remember that even the stinging misery\r\nof that night kept me from sleeping soundly. I could always sleep,\r\nnever knowing \"horrid night, the child of hell.\"\r\n\r\nOur friends in Pittsburgh had been anxiously waiting to hear from us,\r\nand in their warm and affectionate greeting all our troubles were\r\nforgotten. We took up our residence with them in Allegheny City. A\r\nbrother of my Uncle Hogan had built a small weaver's shop at the back\r\nend of a lot in Rebecca Street. This had a second story in which there\r\nwere two rooms, and it was in these (free of rent, for my Aunt Aitken\r\nowned them) that my parents began housekeeping. My uncle soon gave up\r\nweaving and my father took his place and began making tablecloths,\r\nwhich he had not only to weave, but afterwards, acting as his own\r\nmerchant, to travel and sell, as no dealers could be found to take\r\nthem in quantity. He was compelled to market them himself, selling\r\nfrom door to door. The returns were meager in the extreme.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANDREW CARNEGIE AT SIXTEEN WITH HIS BROTHER THOMAS]\r\n\r\nAs usual, my mother came to the rescue. There was no keeping her down.\r\nIn her youth she had learned to bind shoes in her father's business\r\nfor pin-money, and the skill then acquired was now turned to account\r\nfor the benefit of the family. Mr. Phipps, father of my friend and\r\npartner Mr. Henry Phipps, was, like my grandfather, a master\r\nshoemaker. He was our neighbor in Allegheny City. Work was obtained\r\nfrom him, and in addition to attending to her household duties--for,\r\nof course, we had no servant--this wonderful woman, my mother, earned\r\nfour dollars a week by binding shoes. Midnight would often find her at\r\nwork. In the intervals during the day and evening, when household\r\ncares would permit, and my young brother sat at her knee threading\r\nneedles and waxing the thread for her, she recited to him, as she had\r\nto me, the gems of Scottish minstrelsy which she seemed to have by\r\nheart, or told him tales which failed not to contain a moral.\r\n\r\nThis is where the children of honest poverty have the most precious of\r\nall advantages over those of wealth. The mother, nurse, cook,\r\ngoverness, teacher, saint, all in one; the father, exemplar, guide,\r\ncounselor, and friend! Thus were my brother and I brought up. What has\r\nthe child of millionaire or nobleman that counts compared to such a\r\nheritage?\r\n\r\nMy mother was a busy woman, but all her work did not prevent her\r\nneighbors from soon recognizing her as a wise and kindly woman whom\r\nthey could call upon for counsel or help in times of trouble. Many\r\nhave told me what my mother did for them. So it was in after years\r\nwherever we resided; rich and poor came to her with their trials and\r\nfound good counsel. She towered among her neighbors wherever she\r\nwent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPITTSBURGH AND WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great question now was, what could be found for me to do. I had\r\njust completed my thirteenth year, and I fairly panted to get to work\r\nthat I might help the family to a start in the new land. The prospect\r\nof want had become to me a frightful nightmare. My thoughts at this\r\nperiod centered in the determination that we should make and save\r\nenough of money to produce three hundred dollars a year--twenty-five\r\ndollars monthly, which I figured was the sum required to keep us\r\nwithout being dependent upon others. Every necessary thing was very\r\ncheap in those days.\r\n\r\nThe brother of my Uncle Hogan would often ask what my parents meant to\r\ndo with me, and one day there occurred the most tragic of all scenes I\r\nhave ever witnessed. Never can I forget it. He said, with the kindest\r\nintentions in the world, to my mother, that I was a likely boy and apt\r\nto learn; and he believed that if a basket were fitted out for me with\r\nknickknacks to sell, I could peddle them around the wharves and make\r\nquite a considerable sum. I never knew what an enraged woman meant\r\ntill then. My mother was sitting sewing at the moment, but she sprang\r\nto her feet with outstretched hands and shook them in his face.\r\n\r\n\"What! my son a peddler and go among rough men upon the wharves! I\r\nwould rather throw him into the Allegheny River. Leave me!\" she cried,\r\npointing to the door, and Mr. Hogan went.\r\n\r\nShe stood a tragic queen. The next moment she had broken down, but\r\nonly for a few moments did tears fall and sobs come. Then she took her\r\ntwo boys in her arms and told us not to mind her foolishness. There\r\nwere many things in the world for us to do and we could be useful men,\r\nhonored and respected, if we always did what was right. It was a\r\nrepetition of Helen Macgregor, in her reply to Osbaldistone in which\r\nshe threatened to have her prisoners \"chopped into as many pieces as\r\nthere are checks in the tartan.\" But the reason for the outburst was\r\ndifferent. It was not because the occupation suggested was peaceful\r\nlabor, for we were taught that idleness was disgraceful; but because\r\nthe suggested occupation was somewhat vagrant in character and not\r\nentirely respectable in her eyes. Better death. Yes, mother would have\r\ntaken her two boys, one under each arm, and perished with them rather\r\nthan they should mingle with low company in their extreme youth.\r\n\r\nAs I look back upon the early struggles this can be said: there was\r\nnot a prouder family in the land. A keen sense of honor, independence,\r\nself-respect, pervaded the household. Walter Scott said of Burns that\r\nhe had the most extraordinary eye he ever saw in a human being. I can\r\nsay as much for my mother. As Burns has it:\r\n\r\n    \"Her eye even turned on empty space,\r\n    Beamed keen with honor.\"\r\n\r\nAnything low, mean, deceitful, shifty, coarse, underhand, or gossipy\r\nwas foreign to that heroic soul. Tom and I could not help growing up\r\nrespectable characters, having such a mother and such a father, for\r\nthe father, too, was one of nature's noblemen, beloved by all, a\r\nsaint.\r\n\r\nSoon after this incident my father found it necessary to give up\r\nhand-loom weaving and to enter the cotton factory of Mr. Blackstock,\r\nan old Scotsman in Allegheny City, where we lived. In this factory he\r\nalso obtained for me a position as bobbin boy, and my first work was\r\ndone there at one dollar and twenty cents per week. It was a hard\r\nlife. In the winter father and I had to rise and breakfast in the\r\ndarkness, reach the factory before it was daylight, and, with a short\r\ninterval for lunch, work till after dark. The hours hung heavily upon\r\nme and in the work itself I took no pleasure; but the cloud had a\r\nsilver lining, as it gave me the feeling that I was doing something\r\nfor my world--our family. I have made millions since, but none of\r\nthose millions gave me such happiness as my first week's earnings. I\r\nwas now a helper of the family, a breadwinner, and no longer a total\r\ncharge upon my parents. Often had I heard my father's beautiful\r\nsinging of \"The Boatie Rows\" and often I longed to fulfill the last\r\nlines of the verse:\r\n\r\n    \"When Aaleck, Jock, and Jeanettie,\r\n    _Are up and got their lair_,[11]\r\n    They'll serve to gar the boatie row,\r\n    And lichten a' our care.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Education.]\r\n\r\nI was going to make our tiny craft skim. It should be noted here that\r\nAaleck, Jock, and Jeanettie were first to get their education.\r\nScotland was the first country that required all parents, high or low,\r\nto educate their children, and established the parish public schools.\r\n\r\nSoon after this Mr. John Hay, a fellow-Scotch manufacturer of bobbins\r\nin Allegheny City, needed a boy, and asked whether I would not go into\r\nhis service. I went, and received two dollars per week; but at first\r\nthe work was even more irksome than the factory. I had to run a small\r\nsteam-engine and to fire the boiler in the cellar of the bobbin\r\nfactory. It was too much for me. I found myself night after night,\r\nsitting up in bed trying the steam gauges, fearing at one time that\r\nthe steam was too low and that the workers above would complain that\r\nthey had not power enough, and at another time that the steam was too\r\nhigh and that the boiler might burst.\r\n\r\nBut all this it was a matter of honor to conceal from my parents. They\r\nhad their own troubles and bore them. I must play the man and bear\r\nmine. My hopes were high, and I looked every day for some change to\r\ntake place. What it was to be I knew not, but that it would come I\r\nfelt certain if I kept on. Besides, at this date I was not beyond\r\nasking myself what Wallace would have done and what a Scotsman ought\r\nto do. Of one thing I was sure, he ought never to give up.\r\n\r\nOne day the chance came. Mr. Hay had to make out some bills. He had no\r\nclerk, and was himself a poor penman. He asked me what kind of hand I\r\ncould write, and gave me some writing to do. The result pleased him,\r\nand he found it convenient thereafter to let me make out his bills. I\r\nwas also good at figures; and he soon found it to be to his\r\ninterest--and besides, dear old man, I believe he was moved by good\r\nfeeling toward the white-haired boy, for he had a kind heart and was\r\nScotch and wished to relieve me from the engine--to put me at other\r\nthings, less objectionable except in one feature.\r\n\r\nIt now became my duty to bathe the newly made spools in vats of oil.\r\nFortunately there was a room reserved for this purpose and I was\r\nalone, but not all the resolution I could muster, nor all the\r\nindignation I felt at my own weakness, prevented my stomach from\r\nbehaving in a most perverse way. I never succeeded in overcoming the\r\nnausea produced by the smell of the oil. Even Wallace and Bruce proved\r\nimpotent here. But if I had to lose breakfast, or dinner, I had all\r\nthe better appetite for supper, and the allotted work was done. A real\r\ndisciple of Wallace or Bruce could not give up; he would die first.\r\n\r\nMy service with Mr. Hay was a distinct advance upon the cotton\r\nfactory, and I also made the acquaintance of an employer who was very\r\nkind to me. Mr. Hay kept his books in single entry, and I was able to\r\nhandle them for him; but hearing that all great firms kept their books\r\nin double entry, and after talking over the matter with my companions,\r\nJohn Phipps, Thomas N. Miller, and William Cowley, we all determined\r\nto attend night school during the winter and learn the larger system.\r\nSo the four of us went to a Mr. Williams in Pittsburgh and learned\r\ndouble-entry bookkeeping.\r\n\r\nOne evening, early in 1850, when I returned home from work, I was told\r\nthat Mr. David Brooks, manager of the telegraph office, had asked my\r\nUncle Hogan if he knew where a good boy could be found to act as\r\nmessenger. Mr. Brooks and my uncle were enthusiastic draught-players,\r\nand it was over a game of draughts that this important inquiry was\r\nmade. Upon such trifles do the most momentous consequences hang. A\r\nword, a look, an accent, may affect the destiny not only of\r\nindividuals, but of nations. He is a bold man who calls anything a\r\ntrifle. Who was it who, being advised to disregard trifles, said he\r\nalways would if any one could tell him what a trifle was? The young\r\nshould remember that upon trifles the best gifts of the gods often\r\nhang.\r\n\r\nMy uncle mentioned my name, and said he would see whether I would take\r\nthe position. I remember so well the family council that was held. Of\r\ncourse I was wild with delight. No bird that ever was confined in a\r\ncage longed for freedom more than I. Mother favored, but father was\r\ndisposed to deny my wish. It would prove too much for me, he said; I\r\nwas too young and too small. For the two dollars and a half per week\r\noffered it was evident that a much larger boy was expected. Late at\r\nnight I might be required to run out into the country with a telegram,\r\nand there would be dangers to encounter. Upon the whole my father said\r\nthat it was best that I should remain where I was. He subsequently\r\nwithdrew his objection, so far as to give me leave to try, and I\r\nbelieve he went to Mr. Hay and consulted with him. Mr. Hay thought it\r\nwould be for my advantage, and although, as he said, it would be an\r\ninconvenience to him, still he advised that I should try, and if I\r\nfailed he was kind enough to say that my old place would be open for\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThis being decided, I was asked to go over the river to Pittsburgh and\r\ncall on Mr. Brooks. My father wished to go with me, and it was settled\r\nthat he should accompany me as far as the telegraph office, on the\r\ncorner of Fourth and Wood Streets. It was a bright, sunshiny morning\r\nand this augured well. Father and I walked over from Allegheny to\r\nPittsburgh, a distance of nearly two miles from our house. Arrived at\r\nthe door I asked father to wait outside. I insisted upon going alone\r\nupstairs to the second or operating floor to see the great man and\r\nlearn my fate. I was led to this, perhaps, because I had by that time\r\nbegun to consider myself something of an American. At first boys used\r\nto call me \"Scotchie! Scotchie!\" and I answered, \"Yes, I'm Scotch and\r\nI am proud of the name.\" But in speech and in address the broad Scotch\r\nhad been worn off to a slight extent, and I imagined that I could\r\nmake a smarter showing if alone with Mr. Brooks than if my good old\r\nScotch father were present, perhaps to smile at my airs.\r\n\r\nI was dressed in my one white linen shirt, which was usually kept\r\nsacred for the Sabbath day, my blue round-about, and my whole Sunday\r\nsuit. I had at that time, and for a few weeks after I entered the\r\ntelegraph service, but one linen suit of summer clothing; and every\r\nSaturday night, no matter if that was my night on duty and I did not\r\nreturn till near midnight, my mother washed those clothes and ironed\r\nthem, and I put them on fresh on Sabbath morning. There was nothing\r\nthat heroine did not do in the struggle we were making for elbow room\r\nin the western world. Father's long factory hours tried his strength,\r\nbut he, too, fought the good fight like a hero and never failed to\r\nencourage me.\r\n\r\nThe interview was successful. I took care to explain that I did not\r\nknow Pittsburgh, that perhaps I would not do, would not be strong\r\nenough; but all I wanted was a trial. He asked me how soon I could\r\ncome, and I said that I could stay now if wanted. And, looking back\r\nover the circumstance, I think that answer might well be pondered by\r\nyoung men. It is a great mistake not to seize the opportunity. The\r\nposition was offered to me; something might occur, some other boy\r\nmight be sent for. Having got myself in I proposed to stay there if I\r\ncould. Mr. Brooks very kindly called the other boy--for it was an\r\nadditional messenger that was wanted--and asked him to show me about,\r\nand let me go with him and learn the business. I soon found\r\nopportunity to run down to the corner of the street and tell my father\r\nthat it was all right, and to go home and tell mother that I had got\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DAVID McCARGO]\r\n\r\nAnd that is how in 1850 I got my first real start in life. From the\r\ndark cellar running a steam-engine at two dollars a week, begrimed\r\nwith coal dirt, without a trace of the elevating influences of life, I\r\nwas lifted into paradise, yes, heaven, as it seemed to me, with\r\nnewspapers, pens, pencils, and sunshine about me. There was scarcely a\r\nminute in which I could not learn something or find out how much there\r\nwas to learn and how little I knew. I felt that my foot was upon the\r\nladder and that I was bound to climb.\r\n\r\nI had only one fear, and that was that I could not learn quickly\r\nenough the addresses of the various business houses to which messages\r\nhad to be delivered. I therefore began to note the signs of these\r\nhouses up one side of the street and down the other. At night I\r\nexercised my memory by naming in succession the various firms. Before\r\nlong I could shut my eyes and, beginning at the foot of a business\r\nstreet, call off the names of the firms in proper order along one side\r\nto the top of the street, then crossing on the other side go down in\r\nregular order to the foot again.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to know the men themselves, for it gave a messenger\r\na great advantage, and often saved a long journey, if he knew members\r\nor employees of firms. He might meet one of these going direct to his\r\noffice. It was reckoned a great triumph among the boys to deliver a\r\nmessage upon the street. And there was the additional satisfaction to\r\nthe boy himself, that a great man (and most men are great to\r\nmessengers), stopped upon the street in this way, seldom failed to\r\nnote the boy and compliment him.\r\n\r\nThe Pittsburgh of 1850 was very different from what it has since\r\nbecome. It had not yet recovered from the great fire which destroyed\r\nthe entire business portion of the city on April 10, 1845. The houses\r\nwere mainly of wood, a few only were of brick, and not one was\r\nfire-proof. The entire population in and around Pittsburgh was not\r\nover forty thousand. The business portion of the city did not extend\r\nas far as Fifth Avenue, which was then a very quiet street, remarkable\r\nonly for having the theater upon it. Federal Street, Allegheny,\r\nconsisted of straggling business houses with great open spaces between\r\nthem, and I remember skating upon ponds in the very heart of the\r\npresent Fifth Ward. The site of our Union Iron Mills was then, and\r\nmany years later, a cabbage garden.\r\n\r\nGeneral Robinson, to whom I delivered many a telegraph message, was\r\nthe first white child born west of the Ohio River. I saw the first\r\ntelegraph line stretched from the east into the city; and, at a later\r\ndate, I also saw the first locomotive, for the Ohio and Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad, brought by canal from Philadelphia and unloaded from a scow\r\nin Allegheny City. There was no direct railway communication to the\r\nEast. Passengers took the canal to the foot of the Allegheny\r\nMountains, over which they were transported to Hollidaysburg, a\r\ndistance of thirty miles by rail; thence by canal again to Columbia,\r\nand then eighty-one miles by rail to Philadelphia--a journey which\r\noccupied three days.[12]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: \"Beyond Philadelphia was the Camden and Amboy Railway;\r\nbeyond Pittsburgh, the Fort Wayne and Chicago, separate organizations\r\nwith which we had nothing to do.\" (_Problems of To-day_, by Andrew\r\nCarnegie, p. 187. New York, 1908.)]\r\n\r\nThe great event of the day in Pittsburgh at that time was the arrival\r\nand departure of the steam packet to and from Cincinnati, for daily\r\ncommunication had been established. The business of the city was\r\nlargely that of forwarding merchandise East and West, for it was the\r\ngreat transfer station from river to canal. A rolling mill had begun\r\nto roll iron; but not a ton of pig metal was made, and not a ton of\r\nsteel for many a year thereafter. The pig iron manufacture at first\r\nwas a total failure because of the lack of proper fuel, although the\r\nmost valuable deposit of coking coal in the world lay within a few\r\nmiles, as much undreamt of for coke to smelt ironstone as the stores\r\nof natural gas which had for ages lain untouched under the city.\r\n\r\nThere were at that time not half a dozen \"carriage\" people in the\r\ntown; and not for many years after was the attempt made to introduce\r\nlivery, even for a coachman. As late as 1861, perhaps, the most\r\nnotable financial event which had occurred in the annals of Pittsburgh\r\nwas the retirement from business of Mr. Fahnestock with the enormous\r\nsum of $174,000, paid by his partners for his interest. How great a\r\nsum that seemed then and how trifling now!\r\n\r\nMy position as messenger boy soon made me acquainted with the few\r\nleading men of the city. The bar of Pittsburgh was distinguished.\r\nJudge Wilkins was at its head, and he and Judge MacCandless, Judge\r\nMcClure, Charles Shaler and his partner, Edwin M. Stanton, afterwards\r\nthe great War Secretary (\"Lincoln's right-hand man\") were all well\r\nknown to me--the last-named especially, for he was good enough to take\r\nnotice of me as a boy. In business circles among prominent men who\r\nstill survive, Thomas M. Howe, James Park, C.G. Hussey, Benjamin F.\r\nJones, William Thaw, John Chalfant, Colonel Herron were great men to\r\nwhom the messenger boys looked as models, and not bad models either,\r\nas their lives proved. [Alas! all dead as I revise this paragraph in\r\n1906, so steadily moves the solemn procession.]\r\n\r\nMy life as a telegraph messenger was in every respect a happy one,\r\nand it was while in this position that I laid the foundation of my\r\nclosest friendships. The senior messenger boy being promoted, a new\r\nboy was needed, and he came in the person of David McCargo, afterwards\r\nthe well-known superintendent of the Allegheny Valley Railway. He was\r\nmade my companion and we had to deliver all the messages from the\r\nEastern line, while two other boys delivered the messages from the\r\nWest. The Eastern and Western Telegraph Companies were then separate,\r\nalthough occupying the same building. \"Davy\" and I became firm friends\r\nat once, one great bond being that he was Scotch; for, although \"Davy\"\r\nwas born in America, his father was quite as much a Scotsman, even in\r\nspeech, as my own father.\r\n\r\nA short time after \"Davy's\" appointment a third boy was required, and\r\nthis time I was asked if I could find a suitable one. This I had no\r\ndifficulty in doing in my chum, Robert Pitcairn, later on my successor\r\nas superintendent and general agent at Pittsburgh of the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad. Robert, like myself, was not only Scotch, but Scotch-born,\r\nso that \"Davy,\" \"Bob,\" and \"Andy\" became the three Scotch boys who\r\ndelivered all the messages of the Eastern Telegraph Line in\r\nPittsburgh, for the then magnificent salary of two and a half dollars\r\nper week. It was the duty of the boys to sweep the office each\r\nmorning, and this we did in turn, so it will be seen that we all began\r\nat the bottom. Hon. H.W. Oliver,[13] head of the great manufacturing\r\nfirm of Oliver Brothers, and W.C. Morland,[14] City Solicitor,\r\nsubsequently joined the corps and started in the same fashion. It is\r\nnot the rich man's son that the young struggler for advancement has to\r\nfear in the race of life, nor his nephew, nor his cousin. Let him look\r\nout for the \"dark horse\" in the boy who begins by sweeping out the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Died 1904.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Died 1889.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBERT PITCAIRN]\r\n\r\nA messenger boy in those days had many pleasures. There were wholesale\r\nfruit stores, where a pocketful of apples was sometimes to be had for\r\nthe prompt delivery of a message; bakers' and confectioners' shops,\r\nwhere sweet cakes were sometimes given to him. He met with very kind\r\nmen, to whom he looked up with respect; they spoke a pleasant word and\r\ncomplimented him on his promptness, perhaps asked him to deliver a\r\nmessage on the way back to the office. I do not know a situation in\r\nwhich a boy is more apt to attract attention, which is all a really\r\nclever boy requires in order to rise. Wise men are always looking out\r\nfor clever boys.\r\n\r\nOne great excitement of this life was the extra charge of ten cents\r\nwhich we were permitted to collect for messages delivered beyond a\r\ncertain limit. These \"dime messages,\" as might be expected, were\r\nanxiously watched, and quarrels arose among us as to the right of\r\ndelivery. In some cases it was alleged boys had now and then taken a\r\ndime message out of turn. This was the only cause of serious trouble\r\namong us. By way of settlement I proposed that we should \"pool\" these\r\nmessages and divide the cash equally at the end of each week. I was\r\nappointed treasurer. Peace and good-humor reigned ever afterwards.\r\nThis pooling of extra earnings not being intended to create artificial\r\nprices was really coöperation. It was my first essay in financial\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nThe boys considered that they had a perfect right to spend these\r\ndividends, and the adjoining confectioner's shop had running accounts\r\nwith most of them. The accounts were sometimes greatly overdrawn. The\r\ntreasurer had accordingly to notify the confectioner, which he did in\r\ndue form, that he would not be responsible for any debts contracted by\r\nthe too hungry and greedy boys. Robert Pitcairn was the worst offender\r\nof all, apparently having not only one sweet tooth, but all his teeth\r\nof that character. He explained to me confidentially one day, when I\r\nscolded him, that he had live things in his stomach that gnawed his\r\ninsides until fed upon sweets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCOLONEL ANDERSON AND BOOKS\r\n\r\n\r\nWith all their pleasures the messenger boys were hard worked. Every\r\nother evening they were required to be on duty until the office\r\nclosed, and on these nights it was seldom that I reached home before\r\neleven o'clock. On the alternating nights we were relieved at six.\r\nThis did not leave much time for self-improvement, nor did the wants\r\nof the family leave any money to spend on books. There came, however,\r\nlike a blessing from above, a means by which the treasures of\r\nliterature were unfolded to me.\r\n\r\nColonel James Anderson--I bless his name as I write--announced that he\r\nwould open his library of four hundred volumes to boys, so that any\r\nyoung man could take out, each Saturday afternoon, a book which could\r\nbe exchanged for another on the succeeding Saturday. My friend, Mr.\r\nThomas N. Miller, reminded me recently that Colonel Anderson's books\r\nwere first opened to \"working boys,\" and the question arose whether\r\nmessenger boys, clerks, and others, who did not work with their hands,\r\nwere entitled to books. My first communication to the press was a\r\nnote, written to the \"Pittsburgh Dispatch,\" urging that we should not\r\nbe excluded; that although we did not now work with our hands, some of\r\nus had done so, and that we were really working boys.[15] Dear Colonel\r\nAnderson promptly enlarged the classification. So my first appearance\r\nas a public writer was a success.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: The note was signed \"Working Boy.\" The librarian\r\nresponded in the columns of the _Dispatch_ defending the rules, which\r\nhe claimed meant that \"a Working Boy should have a trade.\" Carnegie's\r\nrejoinder was signed \"A Working Boy, though without a Trade,\" and a\r\nday or two thereafter the _Dispatch_ had an item on its editorial page\r\nwhich read: \"Will 'a Working Boy without a Trade' please call at this\r\noffice.\" (David Homer Bates in _Century Magazine_, July, 1908.)]\r\n\r\nMy dear friend, Tom Miller, one of the inner circle, lived near\r\nColonel Anderson and introduced me to him, and in this way the windows\r\nwere opened in the walls of my dungeon through which the light of\r\nknowledge streamed in. Every day's toil and even the long hours of\r\nnight service were lightened by the book which I carried about with me\r\nand read in the intervals that could be snatched from duty. And the\r\nfuture was made bright by the thought that when Saturday came a new\r\nvolume could be obtained. In this way I became familiar with\r\nMacaulay's essays and his history, and with Bancroft's \"History of the\r\nUnited States,\" which I studied with more care than any other book I\r\nhad then read. Lamb's essays were my special delight, but I had at\r\nthis time no knowledge of the great master of all, Shakespeare, beyond\r\nthe selected pieces in the school books. My taste for him I acquired a\r\nlittle later at the old Pittsburgh Theater.\r\n\r\nJohn Phipps, James R. Wilson, Thomas N. Miller, William\r\nCowley--members of our circle--shared with me the invaluable privilege\r\nof the use of Colonel Anderson's library. Books which it would have\r\nbeen impossible for me to obtain elsewhere were, by his wise\r\ngenerosity, placed within my reach; and to him I owe a taste for\r\nliterature which I would not exchange for all the millions that were\r\never amassed by man. Life would be quite intolerable without it.\r\nNothing contributed so much to keep my companions and myself clear of\r\nlow fellowship and bad habits as the beneficence of the good\r\nColonel. Later, when fortune smiled upon me, one of my first duties\r\nwas the erection of a monument to my benefactor. It stands in front of\r\nthe Hall and Library in Diamond Square, which I presented to\r\nAllegheny, and bears this inscription:\r\n\r\n     To Colonel James Anderson, Founder of Free Libraries in\r\n     Western Pennsylvania. He opened his Library to working boys\r\n     and upon Saturday afternoons acted as librarian, thus\r\n     dedicating not only his books but himself to the noble work.\r\n     This monument is erected in grateful remembrance by Andrew\r\n     Carnegie, one of the \"working boys\" to whom were thus opened\r\n     the precious treasures of knowledge and imagination through\r\n     which youth may ascend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLONEL JAMES ANDERSON]\r\n\r\nThis is but a slight tribute and gives only a faint idea of the depth\r\nof gratitude which I feel for what he did for me and my companions. It\r\nwas from my own early experience that I decided there was no use to\r\nwhich money could be applied so productive of good to boys and girls\r\nwho have good within them and ability and ambition to develop it, as\r\nthe founding of a public library in a community which is willing to\r\nsupport it as a municipal institution. I am sure that the future of\r\nthose libraries I have been privileged to found will prove the\r\ncorrectness of this opinion. For if one boy in each library district,\r\nby having access to one of these libraries, is half as much benefited\r\nas I was by having access to Colonel Anderson's four hundred well-worn\r\nvolumes, I shall consider they have not been established in vain.\r\n\r\n\"As the twig is bent the tree's inclined.\" The treasures of the world\r\nwhich books contain were opened to me at the right moment. The\r\nfundamental advantage of a library is that it gives nothing for\r\nnothing. Youths must acquire knowledge themselves. There is no escape\r\nfrom this. It gave me great satisfaction to discover, many years\r\nlater, that my father was one of the five weavers in Dunfermline who\r\ngathered together the few books they had and formed the first\r\ncirculating library in that town.\r\n\r\nThe history of that library is interesting. It grew, and was removed\r\nno less than seven times from place to place, the first move being\r\nmade by the founders, who carried the books in their aprons and two\r\ncoal scuttles from the hand-loom shop to the second resting-place.\r\nThat my father was one of the founders of the first library in his\r\nnative town, and that I have been fortunate enough to be the founder\r\nof the last one, is certainly to me one of the most interesting\r\nincidents of my life. I have said often, in public speeches, that I\r\nhad never heard of a lineage for which I would exchange that of a\r\nlibrary-founding weaver.[16] I followed my father in library founding\r\nunknowingly--I am tempted almost to say providentially--and it has\r\nbeen a source of intense satisfaction to me. Such a father as mine was\r\na guide to be followed--one of the sweetest, purest, and kindest\r\nnatures I have ever known.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: \"It's a God's mercy we are all from honest weavers; let\r\nus pity those who haven't ancestors of whom they can be proud, dukes\r\nor duchesses though they be.\" (_Our Coaching Trip_, by Andrew\r\nCarnegie. New York, 1882.)]\r\n\r\nI have stated that it was the theater which first stimulated my love\r\nfor Shakespeare. In my messenger days the old Pittsburgh Theater was\r\nin its glory under the charge of Mr. Foster. His telegraphic business\r\nwas done free, and the telegraph operators were given free admission\r\nto the theater in return. This privilege extended in some degree also\r\nto the messengers, who, I fear, sometimes withheld telegrams that\r\narrived for him in the late afternoon until they could be presented\r\nat the door of the theater in the evening, with the timid request\r\nthat the messenger might be allowed to slip upstairs to the second\r\ntier--a request which was always granted. The boys exchanged duties to\r\ngive each the coveted entrance in turn.\r\n\r\nIn this way I became acquainted with the world that lay behind the\r\ngreen curtain. The plays, generally, were of the spectacular order;\r\nwithout much literary merit, but well calculated to dazzle the eye of\r\na youth of fifteen. Not only had I never seen anything so grand, but I\r\nhad never seen anything of the kind. I had never been in a theater, or\r\neven a concert room, or seen any form of public amusement. It was much\r\nthe same with \"Davy\" McCargo, \"Harry\" Oliver, and \"Bob\" Pitcairn. We\r\nall fell under the fascination of the footlights, and every\r\nopportunity to attend the theater was eagerly embraced.\r\n\r\nA change in my tastes came when \"Gust\" Adams,[17] one of the most\r\ncelebrated tragedians of the day, began to play in Pittsburgh a round\r\nof Shakespearean characters. Thenceforth there was nothing for me but\r\nShakespeare. I seemed to be able to memorize him almost without\r\neffort. Never before had I realized what magic lay in words. The\r\nrhythm and the melody all seemed to find a resting-place in me, to\r\nmelt into a solid mass which lay ready to come at call. It was a new\r\nlanguage and its appreciation I certainly owe to dramatic\r\nrepresentation, for, until I saw \"Macbeth\" played, my interest in\r\nShakespeare was not aroused. I had not read the plays.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Edwin Adams.]\r\n\r\nAt a much later date, Wagner was revealed to me in \"Lohengrin.\" I had\r\nheard at the Academy of Music in New York, little or nothing by him\r\nwhen the overture to \"Lohengrin\" thrilled me as a new revelation.\r\nHere was a genius, indeed, differing from all before, a new ladder\r\nupon which to climb upward--like Shakespeare, a new friend.\r\n\r\nI may speak here of another matter which belongs to this same period.\r\nA few persons in Allegheny--probably not above a hundred in all--had\r\nformed themselves into a Swedenborgian Society, in which our American\r\nrelatives were prominent. My father attended that church after leaving\r\nthe Presbyterian, and, of course, I was taken there. My mother,\r\nhowever, took no interest in Swedenborg. Although always inculcating\r\nrespect for all forms of religion, and discouraging theological\r\ndisputes, she maintained for herself a marked reserve. Her position\r\nmight best be defined by the celebrated maxim of Confucius: \"To\r\nperform the duties of this life well, troubling not about another, is\r\nthe prime wisdom.\"\r\n\r\nShe encouraged her boys to attend church and Sunday school; but there\r\nwas no difficulty in seeing that the writings of Swedenborg, and much\r\nof the Old and New Testaments had been discredited by her as unworthy\r\nof divine authorship or of acceptance as authoritative guides for the\r\nconduct of life. I became deeply interested in the mysterious\r\ndoctrines of Swedenborg, and received the congratulations of my devout\r\nAunt Aitken upon my ability to expound \"spiritual sense.\" That dear\r\nold woman fondly looked forward to a time when I should become a\r\nshining light in the New Jerusalem, and I know it was sometimes not\r\nbeyond the bounds of her imagination that I might blossom into what\r\nshe called a \"preacher of the Word.\"\r\n\r\nAs I more and more wandered from man-made theology these fond hopes\r\nweakened, but my aunt's interest in and affection for her first\r\nnephew, whom she had dandled on her knee in Scotland, never waned. My\r\ncousin, Leander Morris, whom she had some hopes of saving through the\r\nSwedenborgian revelation, grievously disappointed her by actually\r\nbecoming a Baptist and being dipped. This was too much for the\r\nevangelist, although she should have remembered her father passed\r\nthrough that same experience and often preached for the Baptists in\r\nEdinburgh.\r\n\r\nLeander's reception upon his first call after his fall was far from\r\ncordial. He was made aware that the family record had suffered by his\r\nbacksliding when at the very portals of the New Jerusalem revealed by\r\nSwedenborg and presented to him by one of the foremost disciples--his\r\naunt. He began deprecatingly:\r\n\r\n\"Why are you so hard on me, aunt? Look at Andy, he is not a member of\r\nany church and you don't scold him. Surely the Baptist Church is\r\nbetter than none.\"\r\n\r\nThe quick reply came:\r\n\r\n\"Andy! Oh! Andy, he's naked, but you are clothed in rags.\"\r\n\r\nHe never quite regained his standing with dear Aunt Aitken. I might\r\nyet be reformed, being unattached; but Leander had chosen a sect and\r\nthat sect not of the New Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nIt was in connection with the Swedenborgian Society that a taste for\r\nmusic was first aroused in me. As an appendix to the hymn-book of the\r\nsociety there were short selections from the oratorios. I fastened\r\ninstinctively upon these, and although denied much of a voice, yet\r\ncredited with \"expression,\" I was a constant attendant upon choir\r\npractice. The leader, Mr. Koethen, I have reason to believe, often\r\npardoned the discords I produced in the choir because of my enthusiasm\r\nin the cause. When, at a later date, I became acquainted with the\r\noratorios in full, it was a pleasure to find that several of those\r\nconsidered in musical circles as the gems of Handel's musical\r\ncompositions were the ones that I as an ignorant boy had chosen as\r\nfavorites. So the beginning of my musical education dates from the\r\nsmall choir of the Swedenborgian Society of Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nI must not, however, forget that a very good foundation was laid for\r\nmy love of sweet sounds in the unsurpassed minstrelsy of my native\r\nland as sung by my father. There was scarcely an old Scottish song\r\nwith which I was not made familiar, both words and tune. Folk-songs\r\nare the best possible foundation for sure progress to the heights of\r\nBeethoven and Wagner. My father being one of the sweetest and most\r\npathetic singers I ever heard, I probably inherited his love of music\r\nand of song, though not given his voice. Confucius' exclamation often\r\nsounds in my ears: \"Music, sacred tongue of God! I hear thee calling\r\nand I come.\"\r\n\r\nAn incident of this same period exhibits the liberality of my parents\r\nin another matter. As a messenger boy I had no holidays, with the\r\nexception of two weeks given me in the summer-time, which I spent\r\nboating on the river with cousins at my uncle's at East Liverpool,\r\nOhio. I was very fond of skating, and in the winter about which I am\r\nspeaking, the slack water of the river opposite our house was\r\nbeautifully frozen over. The ice was in splendid condition, and\r\nreaching home late Saturday night the question arose whether I might\r\nbe permitted to rise early in the morning and go skating before church\r\nhours. No question of a more serious character could have been\r\nsubmitted to ordinary Scottish parents. My mother was clear on the\r\nsubject, that in the circumstances I should be allowed to skate as\r\nlong as I liked. My father said he believed it was right I should go\r\ndown and skate, but he hoped I would be back in time to go with him to\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nI suppose this decision would be arrived at to-day by nine hundred and\r\nninety-nine out of every thousand homes in America, and probably also\r\nin the majority of homes in England, though not in Scotland. But those\r\nwho hold to-day that the Sabbath in its fullest sense was made for\r\nman, and who would open picture galleries and museums to the public,\r\nand make the day somewhat of a day of enjoyment for the masses instead\r\nof pressing upon them the duty of mourning over sins largely\r\nimaginary, are not more advanced than were my parents forty years ago.\r\nThey were beyond the orthodox of the period when it was scarcely\r\npermissible, at least among the Scotch, to take a walk for pleasure or\r\nread any but religious books on the Sabbath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE TELEGRAPH OFFICE\r\n\r\n\r\nI had served as messenger about a year, when Colonel John P. Glass,\r\nthe manager of the downstairs office, who came in contact with the\r\npublic, began selecting me occasionally to watch the office for a few\r\nminutes during his absence. As Mr. Glass was a highly popular man, and\r\nhad political aspirations, these periods of absence became longer and\r\nmore frequent, so that I soon became an adept in his branch of the\r\nwork. I received messages from the public and saw that those that came\r\nfrom the operating-room were properly assigned to the boys for prompt\r\ndelivery.\r\n\r\nThis was a trying position for a boy to fill, and at that time I was\r\nnot popular with the other boys, who resented my exemption from part\r\nof my legitimate work. I was also taxed with being penurious in my\r\nhabits--mean, as the boys had it. I did not spend my extra dimes, but\r\nthey knew not the reason. Every penny that I could save I knew was\r\nneeded at home. My parents were wise and nothing was withheld from me.\r\nI knew every week the receipts of each of the three who were\r\nworking--my father, my mother, and myself. I also knew all the\r\nexpenditures. We consulted upon the additions that could be made to\r\nour scanty stock of furniture and clothing and every new small article\r\nobtained was a source of joy. There never was a family more united.\r\n\r\nDay by day, as mother could spare a silver half-dollar, it was\r\ncarefully placed in a stocking and hid until two hundred were\r\ngathered, when I obtained a draft to repay the twenty pounds so\r\ngenerously lent to us by her friend Mrs. Henderson. That was a day we\r\ncelebrated. The Carnegie family was free from debt. Oh, the happiness\r\nof that day! The debt was, indeed, discharged, but the debt of\r\ngratitude remains that never can be paid. Old Mrs. Henderson lives\r\nto-day. I go to her house as to a shrine, to see her upon my visits to\r\nDunfermline; and whatever happens she can never be forgotten. [As I\r\nread these lines, written some years ago, I moan, \"Gone, gone with the\r\nothers!\" Peace to the ashes of a dear, good, noble friend of my\r\nmother's.]\r\n\r\nThe incident in my messenger life which at once lifted me to the\r\nseventh heaven, occurred one Saturday evening when Colonel Glass was\r\npaying the boys their month's wages. We stood in a row before the\r\ncounter, and Mr. Glass paid each one in turn. I was at the head and\r\nreached out my hand for the first eleven and a quarter dollars as they\r\nwere pushed out by Mr. Glass. To my surprise he pushed them past me\r\nand paid the next boy. I thought it was a mistake, for I had\r\nheretofore been paid first, but it followed in turn with each of the\r\nother boys. My heart began to sink within me. Disgrace seemed coming.\r\nWhat had I done or not done? I was about to be told that there was no\r\nmore work for me. I was to disgrace the family. That was the keenest\r\npang of all. When all had been paid and the boys were gone, Mr. Glass\r\ntook me behind the counter and said that I was worth more than the\r\nother boys, and he had resolved to pay me thirteen and a half dollars\r\na month.\r\n\r\nMy head swam; I doubted whether I had heard him correctly. He counted\r\nout the money. I don't know whether I thanked him; I don't believe I\r\ndid. I took it and made one bound for the door and scarcely stopped\r\nuntil I got home. I remember distinctly running or rather bounding\r\nfrom end to end of the bridge across the Allegheny River--inside on\r\nthe wagon track because the foot-walk was too narrow. It was Saturday\r\nnight. I handed over to mother, who was the treasurer of the family,\r\nthe eleven dollars and a quarter and said nothing about the remaining\r\ntwo dollars and a quarter in my pocket--worth more to me then than all\r\nthe millions I have made since.\r\n\r\nTom, a little boy of nine, and myself slept in the attic together, and\r\nafter we were safely in bed I whispered the secret to my dear little\r\nbrother. Even at his early age he knew what it meant, and we talked\r\nover the future. It was then, for the first time, I sketched to him\r\nhow we would go into business together; that the firm of \"Carnegie\r\nBrothers\" would be a great one, and that father and mother should yet\r\nride in their carriage. At the time that seemed to us to embrace\r\neverything known as wealth and most of what was worth striving for.\r\nThe old Scotch woman, whose daughter married a merchant in London,\r\nbeing asked by her son-in-law to come to London and live near them,\r\npromising she should \"ride in her carriage,\" replied:\r\n\r\n\"What good could it do me to ride in a carriage gin I could na be seen\r\nby the folk in Strathbogie?\" Father and mother would not only be seen\r\nin Pittsburgh, but should visit Dunfermline, their old home, in style.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning with father, mother, and Tom at breakfast, I\r\nproduced the extra two dollars and a quarter. The surprise was great\r\nand it took some moments for them to grasp the situation, but it soon\r\ndawned upon them. Then father's glance of loving pride and mother's\r\nblazing eye soon wet with tears, told their feeling. It was their\r\nboy's first triumph and proof positive that he was worthy of\r\npromotion. No subsequent success, or recognition of any kind, ever\r\nthrilled me as this did. I cannot even imagine one that could. Here\r\nwas heaven upon earth. My whole world was moved to tears of joy.\r\n\r\nHaving to sweep out the operating-room in the mornings, the boys had\r\nan opportunity of practicing upon the telegraph instruments before the\r\noperators arrived. This was a new chance. I soon began to play with\r\nthe key and to talk with the boys who were at the other stations who\r\nhad like purposes to my own. Whenever one learns to do anything he has\r\nnever to wait long for an opportunity of putting his knowledge to use.\r\n\r\nOne morning I heard the Pittsburgh call given with vigor. It seemed to\r\nme I could divine that some one wished greatly to communicate. I\r\nventured to answer, and let the slip run. It was Philadelphia that\r\nwanted to send \"a death message\" to Pittsburgh immediately. Could I\r\ntake it? I replied that I would try if they would send slowly. I\r\nsucceeded in getting the message and ran out with it. I waited\r\nanxiously for Mr. Brooks to come in, and told him what I had dared to\r\ndo. Fortunately, he appreciated it and complimented me, instead of\r\nscolding me for my temerity; yet dismissing me with the admonition to\r\nbe very careful and not to make mistakes. It was not long before I was\r\ncalled sometimes to watch the instrument, while the operator wished to\r\nbe absent, and in this way I learned the art of telegraphy.\r\n\r\nWe were blessed at this time with a rather indolent operator, who was\r\nonly too glad to have me do his work. It was then the practice for us\r\nto receive the messages on a running slip of paper, from which the\r\noperator read to a copyist, but rumors had reached us that a man in\r\nthe West had learned to read by sound and could really take a message\r\nby ear. This led me to practice the new method. One of the operators\r\nin the office, Mr. Maclean, became expert at it, and encouraged me by\r\nhis success. I was surprised at the ease with which I learned the new\r\nlanguage. One day, desiring to take a message in the absence of the\r\noperator, the old gentleman who acted as copyist resented my\r\npresumption and refused to \"copy\" for a messenger boy. I shut off the\r\npaper slip, took pencil and paper and began taking the message by ear.\r\nI shall never forget his surprise. He ordered me to give him back his\r\npencil and pad, and after that there was never any difficulty between\r\ndear old Courtney Hughes and myself. He was my devoted friend and\r\ncopyist.\r\n\r\nSoon after this incident Joseph Taylor, the operator at Greensburg,\r\nthirty miles from Pittsburgh, wishing to be absent for two weeks,\r\nasked Mr. Brooks if he could not send some one to take his place. Mr.\r\nBrooks called me and asked whether I thought I could do the work. I\r\nreplied at once in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, \"we will send you out there for a trial.\"\r\n\r\nI went out in the mail stage and had a most delightful trip. Mr. David\r\nBruce, a well-known solicitor of Scottish ancestry, and his sister\r\nhappened to be passengers. It was my first excursion, and my first\r\nglimpse of the country. The hotel at Greensburg was the first public\r\nhouse in which I had ever taken a meal. I thought the food wonderfully\r\nfine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY PHIPPS]\r\n\r\nThis was in 1852. Deep cuts and embankments near Greensburg were then\r\nbeing made for the Pennsylvania Railroad, and I often walked out in\r\nthe early morning to see the work going forward, little dreaming that\r\nI was so soon to enter the service of that great corporation. This\r\nwas the first responsible position I had occupied in the telegraph\r\nservice, and I was so anxious to be at hand in case I should be\r\nneeded, that one night very late I sat in the office during a storm,\r\nnot wishing to cut off the connection. I ventured too near the key and\r\nfor my boldness was knocked off my stool. A flash of lightning very\r\nnearly ended my career. After that I was noted in the office for\r\ncaution during lightning storms. I succeeded in doing the small\r\nbusiness at Greensburg to the satisfaction of my superiors, and\r\nreturned to Pittsburgh surrounded with something like a halo, so far\r\nas the other boys were concerned. Promotion soon came. A new operator\r\nwas wanted and Mr. Brooks telegraphed to my afterward dear friend\r\nJames D. Reid, then general superintendent of the line, another fine\r\nspecimen of the Scotsman, and took upon himself to recommend me as an\r\nassistant operator. The telegram from Louisville in reply stated that\r\nMr. Reid highly approved of promoting \"Andy,\" provided Mr. Brooks\r\nconsidered him competent. The result was that I began as a telegraph\r\noperator at the tremendous salary of twenty-five dollars per month,\r\nwhich I thought a fortune. To Mr. Brooks and Mr. Reid I owe my\r\npromotion from the messenger's station to the operating-room.[18] I\r\nwas then in my seventeenth year and had served my apprenticeship. I\r\nwas now performing a man's part, no longer a boy's--earning a dollar\r\nevery working day.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: \"I liked the boy's looks, and it was very easy to see\r\nthat though he was little he was full of spirit. He had not been with\r\nme a month when he began to ask whether I would teach him to\r\ntelegraph. I began to instruct him and found him an apt pupil.\" (James\r\nD. Reid, _The Telegraph in America_, New York, 1879.)\r\n\r\nReid was born near Dunfermline and forty years afterwards Mr. Carnegie\r\nwas able to secure for him the appointment of United States Consul at\r\nDunfermline.]\r\n\r\nThe operating-room of a telegraph office is an excellent school for a\r\nyoung man. He there has to do with pencil and paper, with composition\r\nand invention. And there my slight knowledge of British and European\r\naffairs soon stood me in good stead. Knowledge is sure to prove useful\r\nin one way or another. It always tells. The foreign news was then\r\nreceived by wire from Cape Race, and the taking of successive \"steamer\r\nnews\" was one of the most notable of our duties. I liked this better\r\nthan any other branch of the work, and it was soon tacitly assigned to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThe lines in those days worked poorly, and during a storm much had to\r\nbe guessed at. My guessing powers were said to be phenomenal, and it\r\nwas my favorite diversion to fill up gaps instead of interrupting the\r\nsender and spending minutes over a lost word or two. This was not a\r\ndangerous practice in regard to foreign news, for if any undue\r\nliberties were taken by the bold operator, they were not of a\r\ncharacter likely to bring him into serious trouble. My knowledge of\r\nforeign affairs became somewhat extensive, especially regarding the\r\naffairs of Britain, and my guesses were quite safe, if I got the first\r\nletter or two right.\r\n\r\nThe Pittsburgh newspapers had each been in the habit of sending a\r\nreporter to the office to transcribe the press dispatches. Later on\r\none man was appointed for all the papers and he suggested that\r\nmultiple copies could readily be made of the news as received, and it\r\nwas arranged that I should make five copies of all press dispatches\r\nfor him as extra work for which he was to pay me a dollar per week.\r\nThis, my first work for the press, yielded very modest remuneration,\r\nto be sure; but it made my salary thirty dollars per month, and every\r\ndollar counted in those days. The family was gradually gaining\r\nground; already future millionairedom seemed dawning.\r\n\r\nAnother step which exercised a decided influence over me was joining\r\nthe \"Webster Literary Society\" along with my companions, the trusty\r\nfive already named. We formed a select circle and stuck closely\r\ntogether. This was quite an advantage for all of us. We had before\r\nthis formed a small debating club which met in Mr. Phipps's father's\r\nroom in which his few journeymen shoemakers worked during the day. Tom\r\nMiller recently alleged that I once spoke nearly an hour and a half\r\nupon the question, \"Should the judiciary be elected by the people?\"\r\nbut we must mercifully assume his memory to be at fault. The \"Webster\"\r\nwas then the foremost club in the city and proud were we to be thought\r\nfit for membership. We had merely been preparing ourselves in the\r\ncobbler's room.\r\n\r\nI know of no better mode of benefiting a youth than joining such a\r\nclub as this. Much of my reading became such as had a bearing on\r\nforthcoming debates and that gave clearness and fixity to my ideas.\r\nThe self-possession I afterwards came to have before an audience may\r\nvery safely be attributed to the experience of the \"Webster Society.\"\r\nMy two rules for speaking then (and now) were: Make yourself perfectly\r\nat home before your audience, and simply talk _to_ them, not _at_\r\nthem. Do not try to be somebody else; be your own self and _talk_,\r\nnever \"orate\" until you can't help it.\r\n\r\nI finally became an operator by sound, discarding printing entirely.\r\nThe accomplishment was then so rare that people visited the office to\r\nbe satisfied of the extraordinary feat. This brought me into such\r\nnotice that when a great flood destroyed all telegraph communication\r\nbetween Steubenville and Wheeling, a distance of twenty-five miles, I\r\nwas sent to the former town to receive the entire business then\r\npassing between the East and the West, and to send every hour or two\r\nthe dispatches in small boats down the river to Wheeling. In exchange\r\nevery returning boat brought rolls of dispatches which I wired East,\r\nand in this way for more than a week the entire telegraphic\r\ncommunication between the East and the West _via_ Pittsburgh was\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nWhile at Steubenville I learned that my father was going to Wheeling\r\nand Cincinnati to sell the tablecloths he had woven. I waited for the\r\nboat, which did not arrive till late in the evening, and went down to\r\nmeet him. I remember how deeply affected I was on finding that instead\r\nof taking a cabin passage, he had resolved not to pay the price, but\r\nto go down the river as a deck passenger. I was indignant that one of\r\nso fine a nature should be compelled to travel thus. But there was\r\ncomfort in saying:\r\n\r\n\"Well, father, it will not be long before mother and you shall ride in\r\nyour carriage.\"\r\n\r\nMy father was usually shy, reserved, and keenly sensitive, very saving\r\nof praise (a Scotch trait) lest his sons might be too greatly\r\nuplifted; but when touched he lost his self-control. He was so upon\r\nthis occasion, and grasped my hand with a look which I often see and\r\ncan never forget. He murmured slowly:\r\n\r\n\"Andra, I am proud of you.\"\r\n\r\nThe voice trembled and he seemed ashamed of himself for saying so\r\nmuch. The tear had to be wiped from his eye, I fondly noticed, as he\r\nbade me good-night and told me to run back to my office. Those words\r\nrang in my ear and warmed my heart for years and years. We understood\r\neach other. How reserved the Scot is! Where he feels most he\r\nexpresses least. Quite right. There are holy depths which it is\r\nsacrilege to disturb. Silence is more eloquent than words. My father\r\nwas one of the most lovable of men, beloved of his companions, deeply\r\nreligious, although non-sectarian and non-theological, not much of a\r\nman of the world, but a man all over for heaven. He was kindness\r\nitself, although reserved. Alas! he passed away soon after returning\r\nfrom this Western tour just as we were becoming able to give him a\r\nlife of leisure and comfort.\r\n\r\nAfter my return to Pittsburgh it was not long before I made the\r\nacquaintance of an extraordinary man, Thomas A. Scott, one to whom the\r\nterm \"genius\" in his department may safely be applied. He had come to\r\nPittsburgh as superintendent of that division of the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad. Frequent telegraphic communication was necessary between him\r\nand his superior, Mr. Lombaert, general superintendent at Altoona.\r\nThis brought him to the telegraph office at nights, and upon several\r\noccasions I happened to be the operator. One day I was surprised by\r\none of his assistants, with whom I was acquainted, telling me that Mr.\r\nScott had asked him whether he thought that I could be obtained as his\r\nclerk and telegraph operator, to which this young man told me he had\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n\"That is impossible. He is now an operator.\"\r\n\r\nBut when I heard this I said at once:\r\n\r\n\"Not so fast. He can have me. I want to get out of a mere office life.\r\nPlease go and tell him so.\"\r\n\r\nThe result was I was engaged February 1, 1853, at a salary of\r\nthirty-five dollars a month as Mr. Scott's clerk and operator. A raise\r\nin wages from twenty-five to thirty-five dollars per month was the\r\ngreatest I had ever known. The public telegraph line was temporarily\r\nput into Mr. Scott's office at the outer depot and the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad Company was given permission to use the wire at seasons when\r\nsuch use would not interfere with the general public business, until\r\ntheir own line, then being built, was completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nRAILROAD SERVICE\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the operating-room of the telegraph office I had now stepped into\r\nthe open world, and the change at first was far from agreeable. I had\r\njust reached my eighteenth birthday, and I do not see how it could be\r\npossible for any boy to arrive at that age much freer from a knowledge\r\nof anything but what was pure and good. I do not believe, up to that\r\ntime, I had ever spoken a bad word in my life and seldom heard one. I\r\nknew nothing of the base and the vile. Fortunately I had always been\r\nbrought in contact with good people.\r\n\r\nI was now plunged at once into the company of coarse men, for the\r\noffice was temporarily only a portion of the shops and the\r\nheadquarters for the freight conductors, brakemen, and firemen. All of\r\nthem had access to the same room with Superintendent Scott and myself,\r\nand they availed themselves of it. This was a different world, indeed,\r\nfrom that to which I had been accustomed. I was not happy about it. I\r\nate, necessarily, of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and\r\nevil for the first time. But there were still the sweet and pure\r\nsurroundings of home, where nothing coarse or wicked ever entered, and\r\nbesides, there was the world in which I dwelt with my companions, all\r\nof them refined young men, striving to improve themselves and become\r\nrespected citizens. I passed through this phase of my life detesting\r\nwhat was foreign to my nature and my early education. The experience\r\nwith coarse men was probably beneficial because it gave me a \"scunner\"\r\n(disgust), to use a Scotism, at chewing or smoking tobacco, also at\r\nswearing or the use of improper language, which fortunately remained\r\nwith me through life.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to suggest that the men of whom I have spoken were\r\nreally degraded or bad characters. The habit of swearing, with coarse\r\ntalk, chewing and smoking tobacco, and snuffing were more prevalent\r\nthen than to-day and meant less than in this age. Railroading was new,\r\nand many rough characters were attracted to it from the river service.\r\nBut many of the men were fine young fellows who have lived to be\r\nhighly respectable citizens and to occupy responsible positions. And I\r\nmust say that one and all of them were most kind to me. Many are yet\r\nliving from whom I hear occasionally and regard with affection. A\r\nchange came at last when Mr. Scott had his own office which he and I\r\noccupied.\r\n\r\nI was soon sent by Mr. Scott to Altoona to get the monthly pay-rolls\r\nand checks. The railroad line was not completed over the Allegheny\r\nMountains at that time, and I had to pass over the inclined planes\r\nwhich made the journey a remarkable one to me. Altoona was then\r\ncomposed of a few houses built by the company. The shops were under\r\nconstruction and there was nothing of the large city which now\r\noccupies the site. It was there that I saw for the first time the\r\ngreat man in our railroad field--Mr. Lombaert, general superintendent.\r\nHis secretary at that time was my friend, Robert Pitcairn, for whom I\r\nhad obtained a situation on the railroad, so that \"Davy,\" \"Bob,\" and\r\n\"Andy\" were still together in the same service. We had all left the\r\ntelegraph company for the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.\r\n\r\nMr. Lombaert was very different from Mr. Scott; he was not sociable,\r\nbut rather stern and unbending. Judge then of Robert's surprise, and\r\nmy own, when, after saying a few words to me, Mr. Lombaert added: \"You\r\nmust come down and take tea with us to-night.\" I stammered out\r\nsomething of acceptance and awaited the appointed hour with great\r\ntrepidation. Up to this time I considered that invitation the greatest\r\nhonor I had received. Mrs. Lombaert was exceedingly kind, and Mr.\r\nLombaert's introduction of me to her was: \"This is Mr. Scott's\r\n'Andy.'\" I was very proud indeed of being recognized as belonging to\r\nMr. Scott.\r\n\r\nAn incident happened on this trip which might have blasted my career\r\nfor a time. I started next morning for Pittsburgh with the pay-rolls\r\nand checks, as I thought, securely placed under my waistcoat, as it\r\nwas too large a package for my pockets. I was a very enthusiastic\r\nrailroader at that time and preferred riding upon the engine. I got\r\nupon the engine that took me to Hollidaysburg where the State railroad\r\nover the mountain was joined up. It was a very rough ride, indeed, and\r\nat one place, uneasily feeling for the pay-roll package, I was\r\nhorrified to find that the jolting of the train had shaken it out. I\r\nhad lost it!\r\n\r\nThere was no use in disguising the fact that such a failure would ruin\r\nme. To have been sent for the pay-rolls and checks and to lose the\r\npackage, which I should have \"grasped as my honor,\" was a dreadful\r\nshowing. I called the engineer and told him it must have been shaken\r\nout within the last few miles. Would he reverse his engine and run\r\nback for it? Kind soul, he did so. I watched the line, and on the very\r\nbanks of a large stream, within a few feet of the water, I saw that\r\npackage lying. I could scarcely believe my eyes. I ran down and\r\ngrasped it. It was all right. Need I add that it never passed out of\r\nmy firm grasp again until it was safe in Pittsburgh? The engineer and\r\nfireman were the only persons who knew of my carelessness, and I had\r\ntheir assurance that it would not be told.\r\n\r\nIt was long after the event that I ventured to tell the story. Suppose\r\nthat package had fallen just a few feet farther away and been swept\r\ndown by the stream, how many years of faithful service would it have\r\nrequired upon my part to wipe out the effect of that one piece of\r\ncarelessness! I could no longer have enjoyed the confidence of those\r\nwhose confidence was essential to success had fortune not favored me.\r\nI have never since believed in being too hard on a young man, even if\r\nhe does commit a dreadful mistake or two; and I have always tried in\r\njudging such to remember the difference it would have made in my own\r\ncareer but for an accident which restored to me that lost package at\r\nthe edge of the stream a few miles from Hollidaysburg. I could go\r\nstraight to the very spot to-day, and often as I passed over that line\r\nafterwards I never failed to see that light-brown package lying upon\r\nthe bank. It seemed to be calling:\r\n\r\n\"All right, my boy! the good gods were with you, but don't do it\r\nagain!\"\r\n\r\nAt an early age I became a strong anti-slavery partisan and hailed\r\nwith enthusiasm the first national meeting of the Republican Party in\r\nPittsburgh, February 22, 1856, although too young to vote. I watched\r\nthe prominent men as they walked the streets, lost in admiration for\r\nSenators Wilson, Hale, and others. Some time before I had organized\r\namong the railroad men a club of a hundred for the \"New York Weekly\r\nTribune,\" and ventured occasionally upon short notes to the great\r\neditor, Horace Greeley, who did so much to arouse the people to action\r\nupon this vital question.\r\n\r\nThe first time I saw my work in type in the then flaming organ of\r\nfreedom certainly marked a stage in my career. I kept that \"Tribune\"\r\nfor years. Looking back to-day one cannot help regretting so high a\r\nprice as the Civil War had to be paid to free our land from the curse,\r\nbut it was not slavery alone that needed abolition. The loose Federal\r\nsystem with State rights so prominent would inevitably have prevented,\r\nor at least long delayed, the formation of one solid, all-powerful,\r\ncentral government. The tendency under the Southern idea was\r\ncentrifugal. To-day it is centripetal, all drawn toward the center\r\nunder the sway of the Supreme Court, the decisions of which are, very\r\nproperly, half the dicta of lawyers and half the work of statesmen.\r\nUniformity in many fields must be secured. Marriage, divorce,\r\nbankruptcy, railroad supervision, control of corporations, and some\r\nother departments should in some measure be brought under one head.\r\n[Re-reading this paragraph to-day, July, 1907, written many years ago,\r\nit seems prophetic. These are now burning questions.]\r\n\r\nIt was not long after this that the railroad company constructed its\r\nown telegraph line. We had to supply it with operators. Most of these\r\nwere taught in our offices at Pittsburgh. The telegraph business\r\ncontinued to increase with startling rapidity. We could scarcely\r\nprovide facilities fast enough. New telegraph offices were required.\r\nMy fellow messenger-boy, \"Davy\" McCargo, I appointed superintendent of\r\nthe telegraph department March 11, 1859. I have been told that \"Davy\"\r\nand myself are entitled to the credit of being the first to employ\r\nyoung women as telegraph operators in the United States upon\r\nrailroads, or perhaps in any branch. At all events, we placed girls in\r\nvarious offices as pupils, taught and then put them in charge of\r\noffices as occasion required. Among the first of these was my cousin,\r\nMiss Maria Hogan. She was the operator at the freight station in\r\nPittsburgh, and with her were placed successive pupils, her office\r\nbecoming a school. Our experience was that young women operators were\r\nmore to be relied upon than young men. Among all the new occupations\r\ninvaded by women I do not know of any better suited for them than that\r\nof telegraph operator.\r\n\r\nMr. Scott was one of the most delightful superiors that anybody could\r\nhave and I soon became warmly attached to him. He was my great man and\r\nall the hero worship that is inherent in youth I showered upon him. I\r\nsoon began placing him in imagination in the presidency of the great\r\nPennsylvania Railroad--a position which he afterwards attained. Under\r\nhim I gradually performed duties not strictly belonging to my\r\ndepartment and I can attribute my decided advancement in the service\r\nto one well-remembered incident.\r\n\r\nThe railway was a single line. Telegraph orders to trains often became\r\nnecessary, although it was not then a regular practice to run trains\r\nby telegraph. No one but the superintendent himself was permitted to\r\ngive a train order on any part of the Pennsylvania system, or indeed\r\nof any other system, I believe, at that time. It was then a dangerous\r\nexpedient to give telegraphic orders, for the whole system of railway\r\nmanagement was still in its infancy, and men had not yet been trained\r\nfor it. It was necessary for Mr. Scott to go out night after night to\r\nbreak-downs or wrecks to superintend the clearing of the line. He was\r\nnecessarily absent from the office on many mornings.\r\n\r\nOne morning I reached the office and found that a serious accident on\r\nthe Eastern Division had delayed the express passenger train\r\nwestward, and that the passenger train eastward was proceeding with a\r\nflagman in advance at every curve. The freight trains in both\r\ndirections were all standing still upon the sidings. Mr. Scott was not\r\nto be found. Finally I could not resist the temptation to plunge in,\r\ntake the responsibility, give \"train orders,\" and set matters going.\r\n\"Death or Westminster Abbey,\" flashed across my mind. I knew it was\r\ndismissal, disgrace, perhaps criminal punishment for me if I erred. On\r\nthe other hand, I could bring in the wearied freight-train men who had\r\nlain out all night. I could set everything in motion. I knew I could.\r\nI had often done it in wiring Mr. Scott's orders. I knew just what to\r\ndo, and so I began. I gave the orders in his name, started every\r\ntrain, sat at the instrument watching every tick, carried the trains\r\nalong from station to station, took extra precautions, and had\r\neverything running smoothly when Mr. Scott at last reached the office.\r\nHe had heard of the delays. His first words were:\r\n\r\n\"Well! How are matters?\"\r\n\r\nHe came to my side quickly, grasped his pencil and began to write his\r\norders. I had then to speak, and timidly said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Scott, I could not find you anywhere and I gave these orders in\r\nyour name early this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they going all right? Where is the Eastern Express?\"\r\n\r\nI showed him the messages and gave him the position of every train on\r\nthe line--freights, ballast trains, everything--showed him the answers\r\nof the various conductors, the latest reports at the stations where\r\nthe various trains had passed. All was right. He looked in my face for\r\na second. I scarcely dared look in his. I did not know what was going\r\nto happen. He did not say one word, but again looked carefully over\r\nall that had taken place. Still he said nothing. After a little he\r\nmoved away from my desk to his own, and that was the end of it. He was\r\nafraid to approve what I had done, yet he had not censured me. If it\r\ncame out all right, it was all right; if it came out all wrong, the\r\nresponsibility was mine. So it stood, but I noticed that he came in\r\nvery regularly and in good time for some mornings after that.\r\n\r\nOf course I never spoke to any one about it. None of the trainmen knew\r\nthat Mr. Scott had not personally given the orders. I had almost made\r\nup my mind that if the like occurred again, I would not repeat my\r\nproceeding of that morning unless I was authorized to do so. I was\r\nfeeling rather distressed about what I had done until I heard from Mr.\r\nFranciscus, who was then in charge of the freighting department at\r\nPittsburgh, that Mr. Scott, the evening after the memorable morning,\r\nhad said to him:\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what that little white-haired Scotch devil of mine did?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm blamed if he didn't run every train on the division in my name\r\nwithout the slightest authority.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did he do it all right?\" asked Franciscus.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, all right.\"\r\n\r\nThis satisfied me. Of course I had my cue for the next occasion, and\r\nwent boldly in. From that date it was very seldom that Mr. Scott gave\r\na train order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS A. SCOTT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN EDGAR THOMSON]\r\n\r\nThe greatest man of all on my horizon at this time was John Edgar\r\nThomson, president of the Pennsylvania, and for whom our steel-rail\r\nmills were afterward named. He was the most reserved and silent of\r\nmen, next to General Grant, that I ever knew, although General\r\nGrant was more voluble when at home with friends. He walked about as\r\nif he saw nobody when he made his periodical visits to Pittsburgh.\r\nThis reserve I learned afterwards was purely the result of shyness. I\r\nwas surprised when in Mr. Scott's office he came to the telegraph\r\ninstrument and greeted me as \"Scott's Andy.\" But I learned afterwards\r\nthat he had heard of my train-running exploit. The battle of life is\r\nalready half won by the young man who is brought personally in contact\r\nwith high officials; and the great aim of every boy should be to do\r\nsomething beyond the sphere of his duties--something which attracts\r\nthe attention of those over him.\r\n\r\nSome time after this Mr. Scott wished to travel for a week or two and\r\nasked authority from Mr. Lombaert to leave me in charge of the\r\ndivision. Pretty bold man he was, for I was then not very far out of\r\nmy teens. It was granted. Here was the coveted opportunity of my life.\r\nWith the exception of one accident caused by the inexcusable\r\nnegligence of a ballast-train crew, everything went well in his\r\nabsence. But that this accident should occur was gall and wormwood to\r\nme. Determined to fulfill all the duties of the station I held a\r\ncourt-martial, examined those concerned, dismissed peremptorily the\r\nchief offender, and suspended two others for their share in the\r\ncatastrophe. Mr. Scott after his return of course was advised of the\r\naccident, and proposed to investigate and deal with the matter. I felt\r\nI had gone too far, but having taken the step, I informed him that all\r\nthat had been settled. I had investigated the matter and punished the\r\nguilty. Some of these appealed to Mr. Scott for a reopening of the\r\ncase, but this I never could have agreed to, had it been pressed. More\r\nby look I think than by word Mr. Scott understood my feelings upon\r\nthis delicate point, and acquiesced.\r\n\r\nIt is probable he was afraid I had been too severe and very likely he\r\nwas correct. Some years after this, when I, myself, was superintendent\r\nof the division I always had a soft spot in my heart for the men then\r\nsuspended for a time. I had felt qualms of conscience about my action\r\nin this, my first court. A new judge is very apt to stand so straight\r\nas really to lean a little backward. Only experience teaches the\r\nsupreme force of gentleness. Light but certain punishment, when\r\nnecessary, is most effective. Severe punishments are not needed and a\r\njudicious pardon, for the first offense at least, is often best of\r\nall.\r\n\r\nAs the half-dozen young men who constituted our inner circle grew in\r\nknowledge, it was inevitable that the mysteries of life and death, the\r\nhere and the hereafter, should cross our path and have to be grappled\r\nwith. We had all been reared by good, honest, self-respecting parents,\r\nmembers of one or another of the religious sects. Through the\r\ninfluence of Mrs. McMillan, wife of one of the leading Presbyterian\r\nministers of Pittsburgh, we were drawn into the social circle of her\r\nhusband's church. [As I read this on the moors, July 16, 1912, I have\r\nbefore me a note from Mrs. McMillan from London in her eightieth year.\r\nTwo of her daughters were married in London last week to university\r\nprofessors, one remains in Britain, the other has accepted an\r\nappointment in Boston. Eminent men both. So draws our English-speaking\r\nrace together.] Mr. McMillan was a good strict Calvinist of the old\r\nschool, his charming wife a born leader of the young. We were all more\r\nat home with her and enjoyed ourselves more at her home gatherings\r\nthan elsewhere. This led to some of us occasionally attending her\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nA sermon of the strongest kind upon predestination which Miller heard\r\nthere brought the subject of theology upon us and it would not down.\r\nMr. Miller's people were strong Methodists, and Tom had known little\r\nof dogmas. This doctrine of predestination, including infant\r\ndamnation--some born to glory and others to the opposite--appalled\r\nhim. To my astonishment I learned that, going to Mr. McMillan after\r\nthe sermon to talk over the matter, Tom had blurted out at the finish,\r\n\r\n\"Mr. McMillan, if your idea were correct, your God would be a perfect\r\ndevil,\" and left the astonished minister to himself.\r\n\r\nThis formed the subject of our Sunday afternoon conferences for many a\r\nweek. Was that true or not, and what was to be the consequence of\r\nTom's declaration? Should we no longer be welcome guests of Mrs.\r\nMcMillan? We could have spared the minister, perhaps, but none of us\r\nrelished the idea of banishment from his wife's delightful reunions.\r\nThere was one point clear. Carlyle's struggles over these matters had\r\nimpressed us and we could follow him in his resolve: \"If it be\r\nincredible, in God's name let it be discredited.\" It was only the\r\ntruth that could make us free, and the truth, the whole truth, we\r\nshould pursue.\r\n\r\nOnce introduced, of course, the subject remained with us, and one\r\nafter the other the dogmas were voted down as the mistaken ideas of\r\nmen of a less enlightened age. I forget who first started us with a\r\nsecond axiom. It was one we often dwelt upon: \"A forgiving God would\r\nbe the noblest work of man.\" We accepted as proven that each stage of\r\ncivilization creates its own God, and that as man ascends and becomes\r\nbetter his conception of the Unknown likewise improves. Thereafter we\r\nall became less theological, but I am sure more truly religious. The\r\ncrisis passed. Happily we were not excluded from Mrs. McMillan's\r\nsociety. It was a notable day, however, when we resolved to stand by\r\nMiller's statement, even if it involved banishment and worse. We young\r\nmen were getting to be pretty wild boys about theology, although more\r\ntruly reverent about religion.\r\n\r\nThe first great loss to our circle came when John Phipps was killed by\r\na fall from a horse. This struck home to all of us, yet I remember I\r\ncould then say to myself: \"John has, as it were, just gone home to\r\nEngland where he was born. We are all to follow him soon and live\r\nforever together.\" I had then no doubts. It was not a hope I was\r\npressing to my heart, but a certainty. Happy those who in their agony\r\nhave such a refuge. We should all take Plato's advice and never give\r\nup everlasting hope, \"alluring ourselves as with enchantments, for the\r\nhope is noble and the reward is great.\" Quite right. It would be no\r\ngreater miracle that brought us into another world to live forever\r\nwith our dearest than that which has brought us into this one to live\r\na lifetime with them. Both are equally incomprehensible to finite\r\nbeings. Let us therefore comfort ourselves with everlasting hope, \"as\r\nwith enchantments,\" as Plato recommends, never forgetting, however,\r\nthat we all have our duties here and that the kingdom of heaven is\r\nwithin us. It also passed into an axiom with us that he who proclaims\r\nthere is no hereafter is as foolish as he who proclaims there is,\r\nsince neither can know, though all may and should hope. Meanwhile\r\n\"Home our heaven\" instead of \"Heaven our home\" was our motto.\r\n\r\nDuring these years of which I have been writing, the family fortunes\r\nhad been steadily improving. My thirty-five dollars a month had grown\r\nto forty, an unsolicited advance having been made by Mr. Scott. It was\r\npart of my duty to pay the men every month.[19] We used checks upon\r\nthe bank and I drew my salary invariably in two twenty-dollar gold\r\npieces. They seemed to me the prettiest works of art in the world. It\r\nwas decided in family council that we could venture to buy the lot and\r\nthe two small frame houses upon it, in one of which we had lived, and\r\nthe other, a four-roomed house, which till then had been occupied by\r\nmy Uncle and Aunt Hogan, who had removed elsewhere. It was through the\r\naid of my dear Aunt Aitken that we had been placed in the small house\r\nabove the weaver's shop, and it was now our turn to be able to ask her\r\nto return to the house that formerly had been her own. In the same way\r\nafter we had occupied the four-roomed house, Uncle Hogan having passed\r\naway, we were able to restore Aunt Hogan to her old home when we\r\nremoved to Altoona. One hundred dollars cash was paid upon purchase,\r\nand the total price, as I remember, was seven hundred dollars. The\r\nstruggle then was to make up the semi-annual payments of interest and\r\nas great an amount of the principal as we could save. It was not long\r\nbefore the debt was cleared off and we were property-holders, but\r\nbefore that was accomplished, the first sad break occurred in our\r\nfamily, in my father's death, October 2, 1855. Fortunately for the\r\nthree remaining members life's duties were pressing. Sorrow and duty\r\ncontended and we had to work. The expenses connected with his illness\r\nhad to be saved and paid and we had not up to this time much store in\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: \"I remember well when I used to write out the monthly\r\npay-roll and came to Mr. Scott's name for $125. I wondered what he did\r\nwith it all. I was then getting thirty-five.\" (Andrew Carnegie in\r\nspeech at Reunion of U.S. Military Telegraph Corps, March 28, 1907.)]\r\n\r\nAnd here comes in one of the sweet incidents of our early life in\r\nAmerica. The principal member of our small Swedenborgian Society was\r\nMr. David McCandless. He had taken some notice of my father and\r\nmother, but beyond a few passing words at church on Sundays, I do not\r\nremember that they had ever been brought in close contact. He knew\r\nAunt Aitken well, however, and now sent for her to say that if my\r\nmother required any money assistance at this sad period he would be\r\nvery pleased to advance whatever was necessary. He had heard much of\r\nmy heroic mother and that was sufficient.\r\n\r\nOne gets so many kind offers of assistance when assistance is no\r\nlonger necessary, or when one is in a position which would probably\r\nenable him to repay a favor, that it is delightful to record an act of\r\npure and disinterested benevolence. Here was a poor Scottish woman\r\nbereft of her husband, with her eldest son just getting a start and a\r\nsecond in his early teens, whose misfortunes appealed to this man, and\r\nwho in the most delicate manner sought to mitigate them. Although my\r\nmother was able to decline the proffered aid, it is needless to say\r\nthat Mr. McCandless obtained a place in our hearts sacred to himself.\r\nI am a firm believer in the doctrine that people deserving necessary\r\nassistance at critical periods in their career usually receive it.\r\nThere are many splendid natures in the world--men and women who are\r\nnot only willing, but anxious to stretch forth a helping hand to those\r\nthey know to be worthy. As a rule, those who show willingness to help\r\nthemselves need not fear about obtaining the help of others.\r\n\r\nFather's death threw upon me the management of affairs to a greater\r\nextent than ever. Mother kept on the binding of shoes; Tom went\r\nsteadily to the public school; and I continued with Mr. Scott in the\r\nservice of the railroad company. Just at this time Fortunatus knocked\r\nat our door. Mr. Scott asked me if I had five hundred dollars. If so,\r\nhe said he wished to make an investment for me. Five hundred cents was\r\nmuch nearer my capital. I certainly had not fifty dollars saved for\r\ninvestment, but I was not going to miss the chance of becoming\r\nfinancially connected with my leader and great man. So I said boldly I\r\nthought I could manage that sum. He then told me that there were ten\r\nshares of Adams Express stock that he could buy, which had belonged to\r\na station agent, Mr. Reynolds, of Wilkinsburg. Of course this was\r\nreported to the head of the family that evening, and she was not long\r\nin suggesting what might be done. When did she ever fail? We had then\r\npaid five hundred dollars upon the house, and in some way she thought\r\nthis might be pledged as security for a loan.\r\n\r\nMy mother took the steamer the next morning for East Liverpool,\r\narriving at night, and through her brother there the money was\r\nsecured. He was a justice of the peace, a well-known resident of that\r\nthen small town, and had numerous sums in hand from farmers for\r\ninvestment. Our house was mortgaged and mother brought back the five\r\nhundred dollars which I handed over to Mr. Scott, who soon obtained\r\nfor me the coveted ten shares in return. There was, unexpectedly, an\r\nadditional hundred dollars to pay as a premium, but Mr. Scott kindly\r\nsaid I could pay that when convenient, and this of course was an easy\r\nmatter to do.\r\n\r\nThis was my first investment. In those good old days monthly\r\ndividends were more plentiful than now and Adams Express paid a\r\nmonthly dividend. One morning a white envelope was lying upon my desk,\r\naddressed in a big John Hancock hand, to \"Andrew Carnegie, Esquire.\"\r\n\"Esquire\" tickled the boys and me inordinately. At one corner was seen\r\nthe round stamp of Adams Express Company. I opened the envelope. All\r\nit contained was a check for ten dollars upon the Gold Exchange Bank\r\nof New York. I shall remember that check as long as I live, and that\r\nJohn Hancock signature of \"J.C. Babcock, Cashier.\" It gave me the\r\nfirst penny of revenue from capital--something that I had not worked\r\nfor with the sweat of my brow. \"Eureka!\" I cried. \"Here's the goose\r\nthat lays the golden eggs.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the custom of our party to spend Sunday afternoons in the\r\nwoods. I kept the first check and showed it as we sat under the trees\r\nin a favorite grove we had found near Wood's Run. The effect produced\r\nupon my companions was overwhelming. None of them had imagined such an\r\ninvestment possible. We resolved to save and to watch for the next\r\nopportunity for investment in which all of us should share, and for\r\nyears afterward we divided our trifling investments and worked\r\ntogether almost as partners.\r\n\r\nUp to this time my circle of acquaintances had not enlarged much. Mrs.\r\nFranciscus, wife of our freight agent, was very kind and on several\r\noccasions asked me to her house in Pittsburgh. She often spoke of the\r\nfirst time I rang the bell of the house in Third Street to deliver a\r\nmessage from Mr. Scott. She asked me to come in; I bashfully declined\r\nand it required coaxing upon her part to overcome my shyness. She was\r\nnever able for years to induce me to partake of a meal in her house. I\r\nhad great timidity about going into other people's houses, until late\r\nin life; but Mr. Scott would occasionally insist upon my going to his\r\nhotel and taking a meal with him, and these were great occasions for\r\nme. Mr. Franciscus's was the first considerable house, with the\r\nexception of Mr. Lombaert's at Altoona, I had ever entered, as far as\r\nI recollect. Every house was fashionable in my eyes that was upon any\r\none of the principal streets, provided it had a hall entrance.\r\n\r\nI had never spent a night in a strange house in my life until Mr.\r\nStokes of Greensburg, chief counsel of the Pennsylvania Railroad,\r\ninvited me to his beautiful home in the country to pass a Sunday. It\r\nwas an odd thing for Mr. Stokes to do, for I could little interest a\r\nbrilliant and educated man like him. The reason for my receiving such\r\nan honor was a communication I had written for the \"Pittsburgh\r\nJournal.\" Even in my teens I was a scribbler for the press. To be an\r\neditor was one of my ambitions. Horace Greeley and the \"Tribune\" was\r\nmy ideal of human triumph. Strange that there should have come a day\r\nwhen I could have bought the \"Tribune\"; but by that time the pearl had\r\nlost its luster. Our air castles are often within our grasp late in\r\nlife, but then they charm not.\r\n\r\nThe subject of my article was upon the attitude of the city toward the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad Company. It was signed anonymously and I was\r\nsurprised to find it got a prominent place in the columns of the\r\n\"Journal,\" then owned and edited by Robert M. Riddle. I, as operator,\r\nreceived a telegram addressed to Mr. Scott and signed by Mr. Stokes,\r\nasking him to ascertain from Mr. Riddle who the author of that\r\ncommunication was. I knew that Mr. Riddle could not tell the author,\r\nbecause he did not know him; but at the same time I was afraid that if\r\nMr. Scott called upon him he would hand him the manuscript, which Mr.\r\nScott would certainly recognize at a glance. I therefore made a clean\r\nbreast of it to Mr. Scott and told him I was the author. He seemed\r\nincredulous. He said he had read it that morning and wondered who had\r\nwritten it. His incredulous look did not pass me unnoticed. The pen\r\nwas getting to be a weapon with me. Mr. Stokes's invitation to spend\r\nSunday with him followed soon after, and the visit is one of the\r\nbright spots in my life. Henceforth we were great friends.\r\n\r\nThe grandeur of Mr. Stokes's home impressed me, but the one feature of\r\nit that eclipsed all else was a marble mantel in his library. In the\r\ncenter of the arch, carved in the marble, was an open book with this\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n    \"He that cannot reason is a fool,\r\n    He that will not a bigot,\r\n    He that dare not a slave.\"\r\n\r\nThese noble words thrilled me. I said to myself, \"Some day, some day,\r\nI'll have a library\" (that was a look ahead) \"and these words shall\r\ngrace the mantel as here.\" And so they do in New York and Skibo\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nAnother Sunday which I spent at his home after an interval of several\r\nyears was also noteworthy. I had then become the superintendent of the\r\nPittsburgh Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The South had\r\nseceded. I was all aflame for the flag. Mr. Stokes, being a leading\r\nDemocrat, argued against the right of the North to use force for the\r\npreservation of the Union. He gave vent to sentiments which caused me\r\nto lose my self-control, and I exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Stokes, we shall be hanging men like you in less than six weeks.\"\r\n\r\nI hear his laugh as I write, and his voice calling to his wife in the\r\nadjoining room:\r\n\r\n\"Nancy, Nancy, listen to this young Scotch devil. He says they will be\r\nhanging men like me in less than six weeks.\"\r\n\r\nStrange things happened in those days. A short time after, that same\r\nMr. Stokes was applying to me in Washington to help him to a major's\r\ncommission in the volunteer forces. I was then in the Secretary of\r\nWar's office, helping to manage the military railroads and telegraphs\r\nfor the Government. This appointment he secured and ever after was\r\nMajor Stokes, so that the man who doubted the right of the North to\r\nfight for the Union had himself drawn sword in the good cause. Men at\r\nfirst argued and theorized about Constitutional rights. It made all\r\nthe difference in the world when the flag was fired upon. In a moment\r\neverything was ablaze--paper constitutions included. The Union and Old\r\nGlory! That was all the people cared for, but that was enough. The\r\nConstitution was intended to insure one flag, and as Colonel Ingersoll\r\nproclaimed: \"There was not air enough on the American continent to\r\nfloat two.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSUPERINTENDENT OF THE PENNSYLVANIA\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Scott was promoted to be the general superintendent of the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad in 1856, taking Mr. Lombaert's place; and he\r\ntook me, then in my twenty-third year, with him to Altoona. This\r\nbreaking-up of associations in Pittsburgh was a sore trial, but\r\nnothing could be allowed to interfere for a moment with my business\r\ncareer. My mother was satisfied upon this point, great as the strain\r\nwas upon her. Besides, \"follow my leader\" was due to so true a friend\r\nas Mr. Scott had been.\r\n\r\nHis promotion to the superintendency gave rise to some jealousy; and\r\nbesides that, he was confronted with a strike at the very beginning of\r\nhis appointment. He had lost his wife in Pittsburgh a short time\r\nbefore and had his lonely hours. He was a stranger in Altoona, his new\r\nheadquarters, and there was none but myself seemingly of whom he could\r\nmake a companion. We lived for many weeks at the railway hotel\r\ntogether before he took up housekeeping and brought his children from\r\nPittsburgh, and at his desire I occupied the same large bedroom with\r\nhim. He seemed anxious always to have me near him.\r\n\r\nThe strike became more and more threatening. I remember being wakened\r\none night and told that the freight-train men had left their trains at\r\nMifflin; that the line was blocked on this account and all traffic\r\nstopped. Mr. Scott was then sleeping soundly. It seemed to me a pity\r\nto disturb him, knowing how overworked and overanxious he was; but he\r\nawoke and I suggested that I should go up and attend to the matter.\r\nHe seemed to murmur assent, not being more than half awake. So I went\r\nto the office and in his name argued the question with the men and\r\npromised them a hearing next day at Altoona. I succeeded in getting\r\nthem to resume their duties and to start the traffic.\r\n\r\nNot only were the trainmen in a rebellious mood, but the men in the\r\nshops were rapidly organizing to join with the disaffected. This I\r\nlearned in a curious manner. One night, as I was walking home in the\r\ndark, I became aware that a man was following me. By and by he came up\r\nto me and said:\r\n\r\n\"I must not be seen with you, but you did me a favor once and I then\r\nresolved if ever I could serve you I would do it. I called at the\r\noffice in Pittsburgh and asked for work as a blacksmith. You said\r\nthere was no work then at Pittsburgh, but perhaps employment could be\r\nhad at Altoona, and if I would wait a few minutes you would ask by\r\ntelegraph. You took the trouble to do so, examined my recommendations,\r\nand gave me a pass and sent me here. I have a splendid job. My wife\r\nand family are here and I was never so well situated in my life. And\r\nnow I want to tell you something for your good.\"\r\n\r\nI listened and he went on to say that a paper was being rapidly signed\r\nby the shopmen, pledging themselves to strike on Monday next. There\r\nwas no time to be lost. I told Mr. Scott in the morning and he at once\r\nhad printed notices posted in the shops that all men who had signed\r\nthe paper, pledging themselves to strike, were dismissed and they\r\nshould call at the office to be paid. A list of the names of the\r\nsigners had come into our possession in the meantime, and this fact\r\nwas announced. Consternation followed and the threatened strike was\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\nI have had many incidents, such as that of the blacksmith, in my life.\r\nSlight attentions or a kind word to the humble often bring back reward\r\nas great as it is unlooked for. No kind action is ever lost. Even to\r\nthis day I occasionally meet men whom I had forgotten, who recall some\r\ntrifling attention I have been able to pay them, especially when in\r\ncharge at Washington of government railways and telegraphs during the\r\nCivil War, when I could pass people within the lines--a father helped\r\nto reach a wounded or sick son at the front, or enabled to bring home\r\nhis remains, or some similar service. I am indebted to these trifles\r\nfor some of the happiest attentions and the most pleasing incidents of\r\nmy life. And there is this about such actions: they are disinterested,\r\nand the reward is sweet in proportion to the humbleness of the\r\nindividual whom you have obliged. It counts many times more to do a\r\nkindness to a poor working-man than to a millionaire, who may be able\r\nsome day to repay the favor. How true Wordsworth's lines:\r\n\r\n    \"That best portion of a good man's life--\r\n    His little, nameless, unremembered acts\r\n    Of kindness and of love.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief happening, judged by its consequences, of the two years I\r\nspent with Mr. Scott at Altoona, arose from my being the principal\r\nwitness in a suit against the company, which was being tried at\r\nGreensburg by the brilliant Major Stokes, my first host. It was feared\r\nthat I was about to be subpoenaed by the plaintiff, and the Major,\r\nwishing a postponement of the case, asked Mr. Scott to send me out of\r\nthe State as rapidly as possible. This was a happy change for me, as I\r\nwas enabled to visit my two bosom companions, Miller and Wilson, then\r\nin the railway service at Crestline, Ohio. On my way thither, while\r\nsitting on the end seat of the rear car watching the line, a\r\nfarmer-looking man approached me. He carried a small green bag in his\r\nhand. He said the brakeman had informed him I was connected with the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad. He wished to show me the model of a car which\r\nhe had invented for night traveling. He took a small model out of the\r\nbag, which showed a section of a sleeping-car.\r\n\r\nThis was the celebrated T.T. Woodruff, the inventor of that now\r\nindispensable adjunct of civilization--the sleeping-car. Its\r\nimportance flashed upon me. I asked him if he would come to Altoona if\r\nI sent for him, and I promised to lay the matter before Mr. Scott at\r\nonce upon my return. I could not get that sleeping-car idea out of my\r\nmind, and was most anxious to return to Altoona that I might press my\r\nviews upon Mr. Scott. When I did so, he thought I was taking time by\r\nthe forelock, but was quite receptive and said I might telegraph for\r\nthe patentee. He came and contracted to place two of his cars upon the\r\nline as soon as they could be built. After this Mr. Woodruff, greatly\r\nto my surprise, asked me if I would not join him in the new enterprise\r\nand offered me an eighth interest in the venture.\r\n\r\nI promptly accepted his offer, trusting to be able to make payments\r\nsomehow or other. The two cars were to be paid for by monthly\r\ninstallments after delivery. When the time came for making the first\r\npayment, my portion was two hundred and seventeen and a half dollars.\r\nI boldly decided to apply to the local banker, Mr. Lloyd, for a loan\r\nof that sum. I explained the matter to him, and I remember that he put\r\nhis great arm (he was six feet three or four) around me, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course I will lend it. You are all right, Andy.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here I made my first note, and actually got a banker to take it. A\r\nproud moment that in a young man's career! The sleeping-cars were a\r\ngreat success and their monthly receipts paid the monthly\r\ninstallments. The first considerable sum I made was from this source.\r\n[To-day, July 19, 1909, as I re-read this, how glad I am that I have\r\nrecently heard from Mr. Lloyd's married daughter telling me of her\r\nfather's deep affection for me, thus making me very happy, indeed.]\r\n\r\nOne important change in our life at Altoona, after my mother and\r\nbrother arrived, was that, instead of continuing to live exclusively\r\nby ourselves, it was considered necessary that we should have a\r\nservant. It was with the greatest reluctance my mother could be\r\nbrought to admit a stranger into the family circle. She had been\r\neverything and had done everything for her two boys. This was her\r\nlife, and she resented with all a strong woman's jealousy the\r\nintroduction of a stranger who was to be permitted to do anything\r\nwhatever in the home. She had cooked and served her boys, washed their\r\nclothes and mended them, made their beds, cleaned their home. Who dare\r\nrob her of those motherly privileges! But nevertheless we could not\r\nescape the inevitable servant girl. One came, and others followed, and\r\nwith these came also the destruction of much of that genuine family\r\nhappiness which flows from exclusiveness. Being served by others is a\r\npoor substitute for a mother's labor of love. The ostentatious meal\r\nprepared by a strange cook whom one seldom sees, and served by hands\r\npaid for the task, lacks the sweetness of that which a mother's hands\r\nlay before you as the expression and proof of her devotion.\r\n\r\nAmong the manifold blessings I have to be thankful for is that neither\r\nnurse nor governess was my companion in infancy. No wonder the\r\nchildren of the poor are distinguished for the warmest affection and\r\nthe closest adherence to family ties and are characterized by a filial\r\nregard far stronger than that of those who are mistakenly called more\r\nfortunate in life. They have passed the impressionable years of\r\nchildhood and youth in constant loving contact with father and mother,\r\nto each they are all in all, no third person coming between. The child\r\nthat has in his father a teacher, companion, and counselor, and whose\r\nmother is to him a nurse, seamstress, governess, teacher, companion,\r\nheroine, and saint all in one, has a heritage to which the child of\r\nwealth remains a stranger.\r\n\r\nThere comes a time, although the fond mother cannot see it, when a\r\ngrown son has to put his arms around his saint and kissing her\r\ntenderly try to explain to her that it would be much better were she\r\nto let him help her in some ways; that, being out in the world among\r\nmen and dealing with affairs, he sometimes sees changes which it would\r\nbe desirable to make; that the mode of life delightful for young boys\r\nshould be changed in some respects and the house made suitable for\r\ntheir friends to enter. Especially should the slaving mother live the\r\nlife of ease hereafter, reading and visiting more and entertaining\r\ndear friends--in short, rising to her proper and deserved position as\r\nHer Ladyship.\r\n\r\nOf course the change was very hard upon my mother, but she finally\r\nrecognized the necessity for it, probably realized for the first time\r\nthat her eldest son was getting on. \"Dear Mother,\" I pleaded, my arms\r\nstill around her, \"you have done everything for and have been\r\neverything to Tom and me, and now do let me do something for you; let\r\nus be partners and let us always think what is best for each other.\r\nThe time has come for you to play the lady and some of these days you\r\nare to ride in your carriage; meanwhile do get that girl in to help\r\nyou. Tom and I would like this.\"\r\n\r\nThe victory was won, and my mother began to go out with us and visit\r\nher neighbors. She had not to learn self-possession nor good manners,\r\nthese were innate; and as for education, knowledge, rare good sense,\r\nand kindliness, seldom was she to meet her equal. I wrote \"never\"\r\ninstead of \"seldom\" and then struck it out. Nevertheless my private\r\nopinion is reserved.\r\n\r\nLife at Altoona was made more agreeable for me through Mr. Scott's\r\nniece, Miss Rebecca Stewart, who kept house for him. She played the\r\npart of elder sister to me to perfection, especially when Mr. Scott\r\nwas called to Philadelphia or elsewhere. We were much together, often\r\ndriving in the afternoons through the woods. The intimacy did not\r\ncease for many years, and re-reading some of her letters in 1906 I\r\nrealized more than ever my indebtedness to her. She was not much\r\nbeyond my own age, but always seemed a great deal older. Certainly she\r\nwas more mature and quite capable of playing the elder sister's part.\r\nIt was to her I looked up in those days as the perfect lady. Sorry am\r\nI our paths parted so widely in later years. Her daughter married the\r\nEarl of Sussex and her home in late years has been abroad. [July 19,\r\n1909, Mrs. Carnegie and I found my elder-sister friend April last, now\r\nin widowhood, in Paris, her sister and also her daughter all well and\r\nhappy. A great pleasure, indeed. There are no substitutes for the true\r\nfriends of youth.]\r\n\r\nMr. Scott remained at Altoona for about three years when deserved\r\npromotion came to him. In 1859 he was made vice-president of the\r\ncompany, with his office in Philadelphia. What was to become of me was\r\na serious question. Would he take me with him or must I remain at\r\nAltoona with the new official? The thought was to me unbearable. To\r\npart with Mr. Scott was hard enough; to serve a new official in his\r\nplace I did not believe possible. The sun rose and set upon his head\r\nso far as I was concerned. The thought of my promotion, except through\r\nhim, never entered my mind.\r\n\r\nHe returned from his interview with the president at Philadelphia and\r\nasked me to come into the private room in his house which communicated\r\nwith the office. He told me it had been settled that he should remove\r\nto Philadelphia. Mr. Enoch Lewis, the division superintendent, was to\r\nbe his successor. I listened with great interest as he approached the\r\ninevitable disclosure as to what he was going to do with me. He said\r\nfinally:\r\n\r\n\"Now about yourself. Do you think you could manage the Pittsburgh\r\nDivision?\"\r\n\r\nI was at an age when I thought I could manage anything. I knew nothing\r\nthat I would not attempt, but it had never occurred to me that anybody\r\nelse, much less Mr. Scott, would entertain the idea that I was as yet\r\nfit to do anything of the kind proposed. I was only twenty-four years\r\nold, but my model then was Lord John Russell, of whom it was said he\r\nwould take the command of the Channel Fleet to-morrow. So would\r\nWallace or Bruce. I told Mr. Scott I thought I could.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, \"Mr. Potts\" (who was then superintendent of the\r\nPittsburgh Division) \"is to be promoted to the transportation\r\ndepartment in Philadelphia and I recommended you to the president as\r\nhis successor. He agreed to give you a trial. What salary do you think\r\nyou should have?\"\r\n\r\n\"Salary,\" I said, quite offended; \"what do I care for salary? I do not\r\nwant the salary; I want the position. It is glory enough to go back\r\nto the Pittsburgh Division in your former place. You can make my\r\nsalary just what you please and you need not give me any more than\r\nwhat I am getting now.\"\r\n\r\nThat was sixty-five dollars a month.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" he said, \"I received fifteen hundred dollars a year when I\r\nwas there; and Mr. Potts is receiving eighteen hundred. I think it\r\nwould be right to start you at fifteen hundred dollars, and after a\r\nwhile if you succeed you will get the eighteen hundred. Would that be\r\nsatisfactory?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, please,\" I said, \"don't speak to me of money!\"\r\n\r\nIt was not a case of mere hire and salary, and then and there my\r\npromotion was sealed. I was to have a department to myself, and\r\ninstead of signing \"T.A.S.\" orders between Pittsburgh and Altoona\r\nwould now be signed \"A.C.\" That was glory enough for me.\r\n\r\nThe order appointing me superintendent of the Pittsburgh Division was\r\nissued December 1, 1859. Preparations for removing the family were\r\nmade at once. The change was hailed with joy, for although our\r\nresidence in Altoona had many advantages, especially as we had a large\r\nhouse with some ground about it in a pleasant part of the suburbs and\r\ntherefore many of the pleasures of country life, all these did not\r\nweigh as a feather in the scale as against the return to old friends\r\nand associations in dirty, smoky Pittsburgh. My brother Tom had\r\nlearned telegraphy during his residence in Altoona and he returned\r\nwith me and became my secretary.\r\n\r\nThe winter following my appointment was one of the most severe ever\r\nknown. The line was poorly constructed, the equipment inefficient and\r\ntotally inadequate for the business that was crowding upon it. The\r\nrails were laid upon huge blocks of stone, cast-iron chairs for\r\nholding the rails were used, and I have known as many as forty-seven\r\nof these to break in one night. No wonder the wrecks were frequent.\r\nThe superintendent of a division in those days was expected to run\r\ntrains by telegraph at night, to go out and remove all wrecks, and\r\nindeed to do everything. At one time for eight days I was constantly\r\nupon the line, day and night, at one wreck or obstruction after\r\nanother. I was probably the most inconsiderate superintendent that\r\never was entrusted with the management of a great property, for, never\r\nknowing fatigue myself, being kept up by a sense of responsibility\r\nprobably, I overworked the men and was not careful enough in\r\nconsidering the limits of human endurance. I have always been able to\r\nsleep at any time. Snatches of half an hour at intervals during the\r\nnight in a dirty freight car were sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe Civil War brought such extraordinary demands on the Pennsylvania\r\nline that I was at last compelled to organize a night force; but it\r\nwas with difficulty I obtained the consent of my superiors to entrust\r\nthe charge of the line at night to a train dispatcher. Indeed, I never\r\ndid get their unequivocal authority to do so, but upon my own\r\nresponsibility I appointed perhaps the first night train dispatcher\r\nthat ever acted in America--at least he was the first upon the\r\nPennsylvania system.\r\n\r\nUpon our return to Pittsburgh in 1860 we rented a house in Hancock\r\nStreet, now Eighth Street, and resided there for a year or more. Any\r\naccurate description of Pittsburgh at that time would be set down as a\r\npiece of the grossest exaggeration. The smoke permeated and penetrated\r\neverything. If you placed your hand on the balustrade of the stair it\r\ncame away black; if you washed face and hands they were as dirty as\r\never in an hour. The soot gathered in the hair and irritated the skin,\r\nand for a time after our return from the mountain atmosphere of\r\nAltoona, life was more or less miserable. We soon began to consider\r\nhow we could get to the country, and fortunately at that time Mr. D.A.\r\nStewart, then freight agent for the company, directed our attention to\r\na house adjoining his residence at Homewood. We moved there at once\r\nand the telegraph was brought in, which enabled me to operate the\r\ndivision from the house when necessary.\r\n\r\nHere a new life was opened to us. There were country lanes and gardens\r\nin abundance. Residences had from five to twenty acres of land about\r\nthem. The Homewood Estate was made up of many hundreds of acres, with\r\nbeautiful woods and glens and a running brook. We, too, had a garden\r\nand a considerable extent of ground around our house. The happiest\r\nyears of my mother's life were spent here among her flowers and\r\nchickens and the surroundings of country life. Her love of flowers was\r\na passion. She was scarcely ever able to gather a flower. Indeed I\r\nremember she once reproached me for pulling up a weed, saying \"it was\r\nsomething green.\" I have inherited this peculiarity and have often\r\nwalked from the house to the gate intending to pull a flower for my\r\nbutton-hole and then left for town unable to find one I could destroy.\r\n\r\nWith this change to the country came a whole host of new\r\nacquaintances. Many of the wealthy families of the district had their\r\nresidences in this delightful suburb. It was, so to speak, the\r\naristocratic quarter. To the entertainments at these great houses the\r\nyoung superintendent was invited. The young people were musical and we\r\nhad musical evenings a plenty. I heard subjects discussed which I had\r\nnever known before, and I made it a rule when I heard these to learn\r\nsomething about them at once. I was pleased every day to feel that I\r\nwas learning something new.\r\n\r\nIt was here that I first met the Vandevort brothers, Benjamin and\r\nJohn. The latter was my traveling-companion on various trips which I\r\ntook later in life. \"Dear Vandy\" appears as my chum in \"Round the\r\nWorld.\" Our neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Stewart, became more and more dear\r\nto us, and the acquaintance we had before ripened into lasting\r\nfriendship. One of my pleasures is that Mr. Stewart subsequently\r\nembarked in business with us and became a partner, as \"Vandy\" did\r\nalso. Greatest of all the benefits of our new home, however, was\r\nmaking the acquaintance of the leading family of Western Pennsylvania,\r\nthat of the Honorable Judge Wilkins. The Judge was then approaching\r\nhis eightieth year, tall, slender, and handsome, in full possession of\r\nall his faculties, with a courtly grace of manner, and the most\r\nwonderful store of knowledge and reminiscence of any man I had yet\r\nbeen privileged to meet. His wife, the daughter of George W. Dallas,\r\nVice-President of the United States, has ever been my type of gracious\r\nwomanhood in age--the most beautiful, most charming venerable old lady\r\nI ever knew or saw. Her daughter, Miss Wilkins, with her sister, Mrs.\r\nSaunders, and her children resided in the stately mansion at Homewood,\r\nwhich was to the surrounding district what the baronial hall in\r\nBritain is or should be to its district--the center of all that was\r\ncultured, refined, and elevating.\r\n\r\nTo me it was especially pleasing that I seemed to be a welcome guest\r\nthere. Musical parties, charades, and theatricals in which Miss\r\nWilkins took the leading parts furnished me with another means of\r\nself-improvement. The Judge himself was the first man of historical\r\nnote whom I had ever known. I shall never forget the impression it\r\nmade upon me when in the course of conversation, wishing to illustrate\r\na remark, he said: \"President Jackson once said to me,\" or, \"I told\r\nthe Duke of Wellington so and so.\" The Judge in his earlier life\r\n(1834) had been Minister to Russia under Jackson, and in the same easy\r\nway spoke of his interview with the Czar. It seemed to me that I was\r\ntouching history itself. The house was a new atmosphere, and my\r\nintercourse with the family was a powerful stimulant to the desire for\r\nimprovement of my own mind and manners.\r\n\r\nThe only subject upon which there was always a decided, though silent,\r\nantagonism between the Wilkins family and myself was politics. I was\r\nan ardent Free-Soiler in days when to be an abolitionist was somewhat\r\nakin to being a republican in Britain. The Wilkinses were strong\r\nDemocrats with leanings toward the South, being closely connected with\r\nleading Southern families. On one occasion at Homewood, on entering\r\nthe drawing-room, I found the family excitedly conversing about a\r\nterrible incident that had recently occurred.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think!\" said Mrs. Wilkins to me; \"Dallas\" (her grandson)\r\n\"writes me that he has been compelled by the commandant of West Point\r\nto sit next a negro! Did you ever hear the like of that? Is it not\r\ndisgraceful? Negroes admitted to West Point!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" I said, \"Mrs. Wilkins, there is something even worse than that.\r\nI understand that some of them have been admitted to heaven!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a silence that could be felt. Then dear Mrs. Wilkins said\r\ngravely:\r\n\r\n\"That is a different matter, Mr. Carnegie.\"\r\n\r\nBy far the most precious gift ever received by me up to that time came\r\nabout in this manner. Dear Mrs. Wilkins began knitting an afghan, and\r\nduring the work many were the inquiries as to whom it was for. No,\r\nthe dear queenly old lady would not tell; she kept her secret all the\r\nlong months until, Christmas drawing near, the gift finished and\r\ncarefully wrapped up, and her card with a few loving words enclosed,\r\nshe instructed her daughter to address it to me. It was duly received\r\nin New York. Such a tribute from such a lady! Well, that afghan,\r\nthough often shown to dear friends, has not been much used. It is\r\nsacred to me and remains among my precious possessions.\r\n\r\nI had been so fortunate as to meet Leila Addison while living in\r\nPittsburgh, the talented daughter of Dr. Addison, who had died a short\r\ntime before. I soon became acquainted with the family and record with\r\ngrateful feelings the immense advantage which that acquaintance also\r\nbrought to me. Here was another friendship formed with people who had\r\nall the advantages of the higher education. Carlyle had been Mrs.\r\nAddison's tutor for a time, for she was an Edinburgh lady. Her\r\ndaughters had been educated abroad and spoke French, Spanish, and\r\nItalian as fluently as English. It was through intercourse with this\r\nfamily that I first realized the indescribable yet immeasurable gulf\r\nthat separates the highly educated from people like myself. But \"the\r\nwee drap o' Scotch bluid atween us\" proved its potency as usual.\r\n\r\nMiss Addison became an ideal friend because she undertook to improve\r\nthe rough diamond, if it were indeed a diamond at all. She was my best\r\nfriend, because my severest critic. I began to pay strict attention to\r\nmy language, and to the English classics, which I now read with great\r\navidity. I began also to notice how much better it was to be gentle in\r\ntone and manner, polite and courteous to all--in short, better\r\nbehaved. Up to this time I had been, perhaps, careless in dress and\r\nrather affected it. Great heavy boots, loose collar, and general\r\nroughness of attire were then peculiar to the West and in our circle\r\nconsidered manly. Anything that could be labeled foppish was looked\r\nupon with contempt. I remember the first gentleman I ever saw in the\r\nservice of the railway company who wore kid gloves. He was the object\r\nof derision among us who aspired to be manly men. I was a great deal\r\nthe better in all these respects after we moved to Homewood, owing to\r\nthe Addisons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nCIVIL WAR PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1861 the Civil War broke out and I was at once summoned to\r\nWashington by Mr. Scott, who had been appointed Assistant Secretary of\r\nWar in charge of the Transportation Department. I was to act as his\r\nassistant in charge of the military railroads and telegraphs of the\r\nGovernment and to organize a force of railway men. It was one of the\r\nmost important departments of all at the beginning of the war.\r\n\r\nThe first regiments of Union troops passing through Baltimore had been\r\nattacked, and the railway line cut between Baltimore and Annapolis\r\nJunction, destroying communication with Washington. It was therefore\r\nnecessary for me, with my corps of assistants, to take train at\r\nPhiladelphia for Annapolis, a point from which a branch line extended\r\nto the Junction, joining the main line to Washington. Our first duty\r\nwas to repair this branch and make it passable for heavy trains, a\r\nwork of some days. General Butler and several regiments of troops\r\narrived a few days after us, and we were able to transport his whole\r\nbrigade to Washington.\r\n\r\nI took my place upon the first engine which started for the Capital,\r\nand proceeded very cautiously. Some distance from Washington I noticed\r\nthat the telegraph wires had been pinned to the ground by wooden\r\nstakes. I stopped the engine and ran forward to release them, but I\r\ndid not notice that the wires had been pulled to one side before\r\nstaking. When released, in their spring upwards, they struck me in the\r\nface, knocked me over, and cut a gash in my cheek which bled\r\nprofusely. In this condition I entered the city of Washington with the\r\nfirst troops, so that with the exception of one or two soldiers,\r\nwounded a few days previously in passing through the streets of\r\nBaltimore, I can justly claim that I \"shed my blood for my country\"\r\namong the first of its defenders. I gloried in being useful to the\r\nland that had done so much for me, and worked, I can truly say, night\r\nand day, to open communication to the South.\r\n\r\nI soon removed my headquarters to Alexandria,[20] Virginia, and was\r\nstationed there when the unfortunate battle of Bull Run was fought. We\r\ncould not believe the reports that came to us, but it soon became\r\nevident that we must rush every engine and car to the front to bring\r\nback our defeated forces. The closest point then was Burke Station. I\r\nwent out there and loaded up train after train of the poor wounded\r\nvolunteers. The rebels were reported to be close upon us and we were\r\nfinally compelled to close Burke Station, the operator and myself\r\nleaving on the last train for Alexandria where the effect of panic was\r\nevident upon every side. Some of our railway men were missing, but the\r\nnumber at the mess on the following morning showed that, compared with\r\nother branches of the service, we had cause for congratulation. A few\r\nconductors and engineers had obtained boats and crossed the Potomac,\r\nbut the great body of the men remained, although the roar of the guns\r\nof the pursuing enemy was supposed to be heard in every sound during\r\nthe night. Of our telegraphers not one was missing the next morning.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: \"When Carnegie reached Washington his first task was to\r\nestablish a ferry to Alexandria and to extend the Baltimore and Ohio\r\nRailroad track from the old depot in Washington, along Maryland Avenue\r\nto and across the Potomac, so that locomotives and cars might be\r\ncrossed for use in Virginia. Long Bridge, over the Potomac, had to be\r\nrebuilt, and I recall the fact that under the direction of Carnegie\r\nand R.F. Morley the railroad between Washington and Alexandria was\r\ncompleted in the remarkably short period of seven days. All hands,\r\nfrom Carnegie down, worked day and night to accomplish the task.\"\r\n(Bates, _Lincoln in the Telegraph Office_, p. 22. New York, 1907.)]\r\n\r\nSoon after this I returned to Washington and made my headquarters in\r\nthe War Building with Colonel Scott. As I had charge of the telegraph\r\ndepartment, as well as the railways, this gave me an opportunity of\r\nseeing President Lincoln, Mr. Seward, Secretary Cameron, and others;\r\nand I was occasionally brought in personal contact with these men,\r\nwhich was to me a source of great interest. Mr. Lincoln would\r\noccasionally come to the office and sit at the desk awaiting replies\r\nto telegrams, or perhaps merely anxious for information.\r\n\r\nAll the pictures of this extraordinary man are like him. He was so\r\nmarked of feature that it was impossible for any one to paint him and\r\nnot produce a likeness. He was certainly one of the most homely men I\r\never saw when his features were in repose; but when excited or telling\r\na story, intellect shone through his eyes and illuminated his face to\r\na degree which I have seldom or never seen in any other. His manners\r\nwere perfect because natural; and he had a kind word for everybody,\r\neven the youngest boy in the office. His attentions were not\r\ngraduated. They were the same to all, as deferential in talking to the\r\nmessenger boy as to Secretary Seward. His charm lay in the total\r\nabsence of manner. It was not so much, perhaps, what he said as the\r\nway in which he said it that never failed to win one. I have often\r\nregretted that I did not note down carefully at the time some of his\r\ncurious sayings, for he said even common things in an original way. I\r\nnever met a great man who so thoroughly made himself one with all men\r\nas Mr. Lincoln. As Secretary Hay so well says, \"It is impossible to\r\nimagine any one a valet to Mr. Lincoln; he would have been his\r\ncompanion.\" He was the most perfect democrat, revealing in every word\r\nand act the equality of men.\r\n\r\nWhen Mason and Slidell in 1861 were taken from the British ship Trent\r\nthere was intense anxiety upon the part of those who, like myself,\r\nknew what the right of asylum on her ships meant to Britain. It was\r\ncertain war or else a prompt return of the prisoners. Secretary\r\nCameron being absent when the Cabinet was summoned to consider the\r\nquestion, Mr. Scott was invited to attend as Assistant Secretary of\r\nWar. I did my best to let him understand that upon this issue Britain\r\nwould fight beyond question, and urged that he stand firm for\r\nsurrender, especially since it had been the American doctrine that\r\nships should be immune from search. Mr. Scott, knowing nothing of\r\nforeign affairs, was disposed to hold the captives, but upon his\r\nreturn from the meeting he told me that Seward had warned the Cabinet\r\nit meant war, just as I had said. Lincoln, too, was at first inclined\r\nto hold the prisoners, but was at last converted to Seward's policy.\r\nThe Cabinet, however, had decided to postpone action until the morrow,\r\nwhen Cameron and other absentees would be present. Mr. Scott was\r\nrequested by Seward to meet Cameron on arrival and get him right on\r\nthe subject before going to the meeting, for he was expected to be in\r\nno surrendering mood. This was done and all went well next day.\r\n\r\nThe general confusion which reigned at Washington at this time had to\r\nbe seen to be understood. No description can convey my initial\r\nimpression of it. The first time I saw General Scott, then\r\nCommander-in-Chief, he was being helped by two men across the pavement\r\nfrom his office into his carriage. He was an old, decrepit man,\r\nparalyzed not only in body, but in mind; and it was upon this noble\r\nrelic of the past that the organization of the forces of the Republic\r\ndepended. His chief commissary, General Taylor, was in some degree a\r\ncounterpart of Scott. It was our business to arrange with these, and\r\nothers scarcely less fit, for the opening of communications and for\r\nthe transportation of men and supplies. They were seemingly one and\r\nall martinets who had passed the age of usefulness. Days would elapse\r\nbefore a decision could be obtained upon matters which required prompt\r\naction. There was scarcely a young active officer at the head of any\r\nimportant department--at least I cannot recall one. Long years of\r\npeace had fossilized the service.\r\n\r\nThe same cause had produced like results, I understood, in the Navy\r\nDepartment, but I was not brought in personal contact with it. The\r\nnavy was not important at the beginning; it was the army that counted.\r\nNothing but defeat was to be looked for until the heads of the various\r\ndepartments were changed, and this could not be done in a day. The\r\nimpatience of the country at the apparent delay in producing an\r\neffective weapon for the great task thrown upon the Government was no\r\ndoubt natural, but the wonder to me is that order was so soon evolved\r\nfrom the chaos which prevailed in every branch of the service.\r\n\r\nAs far as our operations were concerned we had one great advantage.\r\nSecretary Cameron authorized Mr. Scott (he had been made a Colonel) to\r\ndo what he thought necessary without waiting for the slow movements of\r\nthe officials under the Secretary of War. Of this authority unsparing\r\nuse was made, and the important part played by the railway and\r\ntelegraph department of the Government from the very beginning of the\r\nwar is to be attributed to the fact that we had the cordial support of\r\nSecretary Cameron. He was then in the possession of all his faculties\r\nand grasped the elements of the problem far better than his generals\r\nand heads of departments. Popular clamor compelled Lincoln to change\r\nhim at last, but those who were behind the scenes well knew that if\r\nother departments had been as well managed as was the War Department\r\nunder Cameron, all things considered, much of disaster would have been\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nLochiel, as Cameron liked to be called, was a man of sentiment. In his\r\nninetieth year he visited us in Scotland and, passing through one of\r\nour glens, sitting on the front seat of our four-in-hand coach, he\r\nreverently took off his hat and bareheaded rode through the glen,\r\novercome by its grandeur. The conversation turned once upon the\r\nefforts which candidates for office must themselves put forth and the\r\nfallacy that office seeks the man, except in very rare emergencies.\r\nApropos of this Lochiel told this story about Lincoln's second term:\r\n\r\nOne day at Cameron's country home near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, he\r\nreceived a telegram saying that President Lincoln would like to see\r\nhim. Accordingly he went to Washington. Lincoln began:\r\n\r\n\"Cameron, the people about me are telling me that it is my patriotic\r\nduty to become a candidate for a second term, that I am the only man\r\nwho can save my country, and so on; and do you know I'm just beginning\r\nto be fool enough to believe them a little. What do you say, and how\r\ncould it be managed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. President, twenty-eight years ago President Jackson sent\r\nfor me as you have now done and told me just the same story. His\r\nletter reached me in New Orleans and I traveled ten days to reach\r\nWashington. I told President Jackson I thought the best plan would be\r\nto have the Legislature of one of the States pass resolutions\r\ninsisting that the pilot should not desert the ship during these\r\nstormy times, and so forth. If one State did this I thought others\r\nwould follow. Mr. Jackson concurred and I went to Harrisburg, and had\r\nsuch a resolution prepared and passed. Other States followed as I\r\nexpected and, as you know, he won a second term.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Lincoln, \"could you do that now?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said I, \"I am too near to you, Mr. President; but if you desire\r\nI might get a friend to attend to it, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said President Lincoln, \"I leave the matter with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I sent for Foster here\" (who was his companion on the coach and our\r\nguest) \"and asked him to look up the Jackson resolutions. We changed\r\nthem a little to meet new conditions and passed them. The like result\r\nfollowed as in the case of President Jackson. Upon my next visit to\r\nWashington I went in the evening to the President's public reception.\r\nWhen I entered the crowded and spacious East Room, being like Lincoln\r\nvery tall, the President recognized me over the mass of people and\r\nholding up both white-gloved hands which looked like two legs of\r\nmutton, called out: 'Two more in to-day, Cameron, two more.' That is,\r\ntwo additional States had passed the Jackson-Lincoln resolutions.\"\r\n\r\nApart from the light this incident throws upon political life, it is\r\nrather remarkable that the same man should have been called upon by\r\ntwo presidents of the United States, twenty-eight years apart, under\r\nexactly similar circumstances and asked for advice, and that, the same\r\nexpedient being employed, both men became candidates and both secured\r\nsecond terms. As was once explained upon a memorable occasion:\r\n\"There's figuring in all them things.\"\r\n\r\nWhen in Washington I had not met General Grant, because he was in the\r\nWest up to the time of my leaving, but on a journey to and from\r\nWashington he stopped at Pittsburgh to make the necessary arrangements\r\nfor his removal to the East. I met him on the line upon both occasions\r\nand took him to dine with me in Pittsburgh. There were no dining-cars\r\nthen. He was the most ordinary-looking man of high position I had ever\r\nmet, and the last that one would select at first glance as a\r\nremarkable man. I remember that Secretary of War Stanton said that\r\nwhen he visited the armies in the West, General Grant and his staff\r\nentered his car; he looked at them, one after the other, as they\r\nentered and seeing General Grant, said to himself, \"Well, I do not\r\nknow which is General Grant, but there is one that cannot be.\" Yet\r\nthis was he. [Reading this years after it was written, I laugh. It is\r\npretty hard on the General, for I have been taken for him more than\r\nonce.]\r\n\r\nIn those days of the war much was talked about \"strategy\" and the\r\nplans of the various generals. I was amazed at General Grant's freedom\r\nin talking to me about such things. Of course he knew that I had been\r\nin the War Office, and was well known to Secretary Stanton,[21] and\r\nhad some knowledge of what was going on; but my surprise can be\r\nimagined when he said to me:\r\n\r\n\"Well, the President and Stanton want me to go East and take command\r\nthere, and I have agreed to do it. I am just going West to make the\r\nnecessary arrangements.\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"I suspected as much.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going to put Sherman in charge,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"That will surprise the country,\" I said, \"for I think the impression\r\nis that General Thomas should succeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know that,\" he said, \"but I know the men and Thomas will be\r\nthe first to say that Sherman is the man for the work. There will be\r\nno trouble about that. The fact is the western end is pretty far down,\r\nand the next thing we must do is to push the eastern end down a\r\nlittle.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Mr. Carnegie gave to Stanton's college, Kenyon, $80,000,\r\nand on April 26, 1906, delivered at the college an address on the\r\ngreat War Secretary. It has been published under the title _Edwin M.\r\nStanton, an Address by Andrew Carnegie on Stanton Memorial Day at\r\nKenyon College_. (New York, 1906.)]\r\n\r\nThat was exactly what he did. And that was Grant's way of putting\r\nstrategy into words. It was my privilege to become well acquainted\r\nwith him in after years. If ever a man was without the slightest trace\r\nof affectation, Grant was that man. Even Lincoln did not surpass him\r\nin that: but Grant was a quiet, slow man while Lincoln was always\r\nalive and in motion. I never heard Grant use a long or grand word, or\r\nmake any attempt at \"manner,\" but the general impression that he was\r\nalways reticent is a mistake. He was a surprisingly good talker\r\nsometimes and upon occasion liked to talk. His sentences were always\r\nshort and to the point, and his observations upon things remarkably\r\nshrewd. When he had nothing to say he said nothing. I noticed that he\r\nwas never tired of praising his subordinates in the war. He spoke of\r\nthem as a fond father speaks of his children.\r\n\r\nThe story is told that during the trials of war in the West, General\r\nGrant began to indulge too freely in liquor. His chief of staff,\r\nRawlins, boldly ventured to tell him so. That this was the act of a\r\ntrue friend Grant fully recognized.\r\n\r\n\"You do not mean that? I was wholly unconscious of it. I am\r\nsurprised!\" said the General.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do mean it. It is even beginning to be a subject of comment\r\namong your officers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you not tell me before? I'll never drink a drop of liquor\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nHe never did. Time after time in later years, dining with the Grants\r\nin New York, I have seen the General turn down the wine-glasses at his\r\nside. That indomitable will of his enabled him to remain steadfast to\r\nhis resolve, a rare case as far as my experience goes. Some have\r\nrefrained for a time. In one noted case one of our partners refrained\r\nfor three years, but alas, the old enemy at last recaptured its\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\nGrant, when President, was accused of being pecuniarily benefited by\r\ncertain appointments, or acts, of his administration, while his\r\nfriends knew that he was so poor that he had been compelled to\r\nannounce his intention of abandoning the customary state dinners, each\r\none of which, he found, cost eight hundred dollars--a sum which he\r\ncould not afford to pay out of his salary. The increase of the\r\npresidential salary from $25,000 to $50,000 a year enabled him, during\r\nhis second term, to save a little, although he cared no more about\r\nmoney than about uniforms. At the end of his first term I know he had\r\nnothing. Yet I found, when in Europe, that the impression was\r\nwidespread among the highest officials there that there was something\r\nin the charge that General Grant had benefited pecuniarily by\r\nappointments. We know in America how little weight to attach to these\r\ncharges, but it would have been well for those who made them so\r\nrecklessly to have considered what effect they would produce upon\r\npublic opinion in other lands.\r\n\r\nThe cause of democracy suffers more in Britain to-day from the\r\ngenerally received opinion that American politics are corrupt, and\r\ntherefore that republicanism necessarily produces corruption, than\r\nfrom any other one cause. Yet, speaking with some knowledge of\r\npolitics in both lands, I have not the slightest hesitation in saying\r\nthat for every ounce of corruption of public men in the new land of\r\nrepublicanism there is one in the old land of monarchy, only the forms\r\nof corruption differ. Titles are the bribes in the monarchy, not\r\ndollars. Office is a common and proper reward in both. There is,\r\nhowever, this difference in favor of the monarchy; titles are given\r\nopenly and are not considered by the recipients or the mass of the\r\npeople as bribes.\r\n\r\nWhen I was called to Washington in 1861, it was supposed that the war\r\nwould soon be over; but it was seen shortly afterwards that it was to\r\nbe a question of years. Permanent officials in charge would be\r\nrequired. The Pennsylvania Railroad Company was unable to spare Mr.\r\nScott, and Mr. Scott, in turn, decided that I must return to\r\nPittsburgh, where my services were urgently needed, owing to the\r\ndemands made upon the Pennsylvania by the Government. We therefore\r\nplaced the department at Washington in the hands of others and\r\nreturned to our respective positions.\r\n\r\nAfter my return from Washington reaction followed and I was taken with\r\nmy first serious illness. I was completely broken down, and after a\r\nstruggle to perform my duties was compelled to seek rest. One\r\nafternoon, when on the railway line in Virginia, I had experienced\r\nsomething like a sunstroke, which gave me considerable trouble. It\r\npassed off, however, but after that I found I could not stand heat and\r\nhad to be careful to keep out of the sun--a hot day wilting me\r\ncompletely. [That is the reason why the cool Highland air in summer\r\nhas been to me a panacea for many years. My physician has insisted\r\nthat I must avoid our hot American summers.]\r\n\r\nLeave of absence was granted me by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company,\r\nand the long-sought opportunity to visit Scotland came. My mother, my\r\nbosom friend Tom Miller, and myself, sailed in the steamship Etna,\r\nJune 28, 1862, I in my twenty-seventh year; and on landing in\r\nLiverpool we proceeded at once to Dunfermline. No change ever affected\r\nme so much as this return to my native land. I seemed to be in a\r\ndream. Every mile that brought us nearer to Scotland increased the\r\nintensity of my feelings. My mother was equally moved, and I remember,\r\nwhen her eyes first caught sight of the familiar yellow bush, she\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Oh! there's the broom, the broom!\"\r\n\r\nHer heart was so full she could not restrain her tears, and the more I\r\ntried to make light of it or to soothe her, the more she was overcome.\r\nFor myself, I felt as if I could throw myself upon the sacred soil and\r\nkiss it.[22]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: \"It's a God's mercy I was born a Scotchman, for I do not\r\nsee how I could ever have been contented to be anything else. The\r\nlittle dour deevil, set in her own ways, and getting them, too,\r\nlevel-headed and shrewd, with an eye to the main chance always and yet\r\nso lovingly weak, so fond, so led away by song or story, so easily\r\ntouched to fine issues, so leal, so true. Ah! you suit me, Scotia, and\r\nproud am I that I am your son.\" (Andrew Carnegie, _Our Coaching Trip_,\r\np. 152. New York, 1882.)]\r\n\r\nIn this mood we reached Dunfermline. Every object we passed was\r\nrecognized at once, but everything seemed so small, compared with what\r\nI had imagined it, that I was completely puzzled. Finally, reaching\r\nUncle Lauder's and getting into the old room where he had taught Dod\r\nand myself so many things, I exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"You are all here; everything is just as I left it, but you are now\r\nall playing with toys.\"\r\n\r\nThe High Street, which I had considered not a bad Broadway, uncle's\r\nshop, which I had compared with some New York establishments, the\r\nlittle mounds about the town, to which we had run on Sundays to play,\r\nthe distances, the height of the houses, all had shrunk. Here was a\r\ncity of the Lilliputians. I could almost touch the eaves of the house\r\nin which I was born, and the sea--to walk to which on a Saturday had\r\nbeen considered quite a feat--was only three miles distant. The rocks\r\nat the seashore, among which I had gathered wilks (whelks) seemed to\r\nhave vanished, and a tame flat shoal remained. The schoolhouse, around\r\nwhich had centered many of my schoolboy recollections--my only Alma\r\nMater--and the playground, upon which mimic battles had been fought\r\nand races run, had shrunk into ridiculously small dimensions. The fine\r\nresidences, Broomhall, Fordell, and especially the conservatories at\r\nDonibristle, fell one after the other into the petty and\r\ninsignificant. What I felt on a later occasion on a visit to Japan,\r\nwith its small toy houses, was something like a repetition of the\r\nimpression my old home made upon me.\r\n\r\nEverything was there in miniature. Even the old well at the head of\r\nMoodie Street, where I began my early struggles, was changed from what\r\nI had pictured it. But one object remained all that I had dreamed of\r\nit. There was no disappointment in the glorious old Abbey and its\r\nGlen. It was big enough and grand enough, and the memorable carved\r\nletters on the top of the tower--\"King Robert The Bruce\"--filled my\r\neye and my heart as fully as of old. Nor was the Abbey bell\r\ndisappointing, when I heard it for the first time after my return. For\r\nthis I was grateful. It gave me a rallying point, and around the old\r\nAbbey, with its Palace ruins and the Glen, other objects adjusted\r\nthemselves in their true proportions after a time.\r\n\r\nMy relatives were exceedingly kind, and the oldest of all, my dear old\r\nAuntie Charlotte, in a moment of exultation exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you will just be coming back here some day and _keep a shop in\r\nthe High Street_.\"\r\n\r\nTo keep a shop in the High Street was her idea of triumph. Her\r\nson-in-law and daughter, both my full cousins, though unrelated to\r\neach other, had risen to this sublime height, and nothing was too\r\ngreat to predict for her promising nephew. There is an aristocracy\r\neven in shopkeeping, and the family of the green grocer of the High\r\nStreet mingles not upon equal terms with him of Moodie Street.\r\n\r\nAuntie, who had often played my nurse, liked to dwell upon the fact\r\nthat I was a screaming infant that had to be fed with two spoons, as I\r\nyelled whenever one left my mouth. Captain Jones, our superintendent\r\nof the steel works at a later day, described me as having been born\r\n\"with two rows of teeth and holes punched for more,\" so insatiable was\r\nmy appetite for new works and increased production. As I was the first\r\nchild in our immediate family circle, there were plenty of now\r\nvenerable relatives begging to be allowed to play nurse, my aunties\r\namong them. Many of my childhood pranks and words they told me in\r\ntheir old age. One of them that the aunties remembered struck me as\r\nrather precocious.\r\n\r\nI had been brought up upon wise saws and one that my father had taught\r\nme was soon given direct application. As a boy, returning from the\r\nseashore three miles distant, he had to carry me part of the way upon\r\nhis back. Going up a steep hill in the gloaming he remarked upon the\r\nheavy load, hoping probably I would propose to walk a bit. The\r\nresponse, however, which he received was:\r\n\r\n\"Ah, faither, never mind, patience and perseverance make the man, ye\r\nken.\"\r\n\r\nHe toiled on with his burden, but shaking with laughter. He was hoist\r\nwith his own petard, but his burden grew lighter all the same. I am\r\nsure of this.\r\n\r\nMy home, of course, was with my instructor, guide, and inspirer, Uncle\r\nLauder--he who had done so much to make me romantic, patriotic, and\r\npoetical at eight. Now I was twenty-seven, but Uncle Lauder still\r\nremained Uncle Lauder. He had not shrunk, no one could fill his place.\r\nWe had our walks and talks constantly and I was \"Naig\" again to him.\r\nHe had never had any name for me but that and never did have. My dear,\r\ndear uncle, and more, much more than uncle to me.[23]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: \"This uncle, who loved liberty because it is the\r\nheritage of brave souls, in the dark days of the American Civil War\r\nstood almost alone in his community for the cause which Lincoln\r\nrepresented.\" (Hamilton Wright Mabie in _Century Magazine_, vol. 64,\r\np. 958.)]\r\n\r\nI was still dreaming and so excited that I could not sleep and had\r\ncaught cold in the bargain. The natural result of this was a fever. I\r\nlay in uncle's house for six weeks, a part of that time in a critical\r\ncondition. Scottish medicine was then as stern as Scottish theology\r\n(both are now much softened), and I was bled. My thin American blood\r\nwas so depleted that when I was pronounced convalescent it was long\r\nbefore I could stand upon my feet. This illness put an end to my\r\nvisit, but by the time I had reached America again, the ocean voyage\r\nhad done me so much good I was able to resume work.\r\n\r\nI remember being deeply affected by the reception I met with when I\r\nreturned to my division. The men of the eastern end had gathered\r\ntogether with a cannon and while the train passed I was greeted with a\r\nsalvo. This was perhaps the first occasion upon which my subordinates\r\nhad an opportunity of making me the subject of any demonstration, and\r\ntheir reception made a lasting impression. I knew how much I cared for\r\nthem and it was pleasing to know that they reciprocated my feelings.\r\nWorking-men always do reciprocate kindly feeling. If we truly care for\r\nothers we need not be anxious about their feelings for us. Like draws\r\nto like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nBRIDGE-BUILDING\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the Civil War the price of iron went up to something like $130\r\nper ton. Even at that figure it was not so much a question of money as\r\nof delivery. The railway lines of America were fast becoming dangerous\r\nfor want of new rails, and this state of affairs led me to organize in\r\n1864 a rail-making concern at Pittsburgh. There was no difficulty in\r\nobtaining partners and capital, and the Superior Rail Mill and Blast\r\nFurnaces were built.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the demand for locomotives was very great, and with Mr.\r\nThomas N. Miller[24] I organized in 1866 the Pittsburgh Locomotive\r\nWorks, which has been a prosperous and creditable concern--locomotives\r\nmade there having obtained an enviable reputation throughout the\r\nUnited States. It sounds like a fairy tale to-day to record that in\r\n1906 the one-hundred-dollar shares of this company sold for three\r\nthousand dollars--that is, thirty dollars for one. Large annual\r\ndividends had been paid regularly and the company had been very\r\nsuccessful--sufficient proof of the policy: \"Make nothing but the very\r\nbest.\" We never did.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Mr. Carnegie had previous to this--as early as\r\n1861--been associated with Mr. Miller in the Sun City Forge Company,\r\ndoing a small iron business.]\r\n\r\nWhen at Altoona I had seen in the Pennsylvania Railroad Company's\r\nworks the first small bridge built of iron. It proved a success. I saw\r\nthat it would never do to depend further upon wooden bridges for\r\npermanent railway structures. An important bridge on the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad had recently burned and the traffic had been obstructed for\r\neight days. Iron was the thing. I proposed to H.J. Linville, who had\r\ndesigned the iron bridge, and to John L. Piper and his partner, Mr.\r\nSchiffler, who had charge of bridges on the Pennsylvania line, that\r\nthey should come to Pittsburgh and I would organize a company to build\r\niron bridges. It was the first company of its kind. I asked my friend,\r\nMr. Scott, of the Pennsylvania Railroad, to go with us in the venture,\r\nwhich he did. Each of us paid for a one fifth interest, or $1250. My\r\nshare I borrowed from the bank. Looking back at it now the sum seemed\r\nvery small, but \"tall oaks from little acorns grow.\"\r\n\r\nIn this way was organized in 1862 the firm of Piper and Schiffler\r\nwhich was merged into the Keystone Bridge Company in 1863--a name\r\nwhich I remember I was proud of having thought of as being most\r\nappropriate for a bridge-building concern in the State of\r\nPennsylvania, the Keystone State. From this beginning iron bridges\r\ncame generally into use in America, indeed, in the world at large so\r\nfar as I know. My letters to iron manufacturers in Pittsburgh were\r\nsufficient to insure the new company credit. Small wooden shops were\r\nerected and several bridge structures were undertaken. Cast-iron was\r\nthe principal material used, but so well were the bridges built that\r\nsome made at that day and since strengthened for heavier traffic,\r\nstill remain in use upon various lines.\r\n\r\nThe question of bridging the Ohio River at Steubenville came up, and\r\nwe were asked whether we would undertake to build a railway bridge\r\nwith a span of three hundred feet over the channel. It seems\r\nridiculous at the present day to think of the serious doubts\r\nentertained about our ability to do this; but it must be remembered\r\nthis was before the days of steel and almost before the use of\r\nwrought-iron in America. The top cords and supports were all of\r\ncast-iron. I urged my partners to try it anyhow, and we finally closed\r\na contract, but I remember well when President Jewett[25] of the\r\nrailway company visited the works and cast his eyes upon the piles of\r\nheavy cast-iron lying about, which were parts of the forthcoming\r\nbridge, that he turned to me and said:\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe these heavy castings can be made to stand up and\r\ncarry themselves, much less carry a train across the Ohio River.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Thomas L. Jewett, President of the Panhandle.]\r\n\r\nThe Judge, however, lived to believe differently. The bridge remained\r\nuntil recently, though strengthened to carry heavier traffic. We\r\nexpected to make quite a sum by this first important undertaking, but\r\nowing to the inflation of the currency, which occurred before the work\r\nwas finished, our margin of profit was almost swallowed up. It is an\r\nevidence of the fairness of President Edgar Thomson, of the\r\nPennsylvania, that, upon learning the facts of the case, he allowed an\r\nextra sum to secure us from loss. The subsequent position of affairs,\r\nhe said, was not contemplated by either party when the contract was\r\nmade. A great and a good man was Edgar Thomson, a close bargainer for\r\nthe Pennsylvania Railroad, but ever mindful of the fact that the\r\nspirit of the law was above the letter.\r\n\r\nIn Linville, Piper, and Schiffler, we had the best talent of that\r\nday--Linville an engineer, Piper a hustling, active mechanic, and\r\nSchiffler sure and steady. Colonel Piper was an exceptional man. I\r\nheard President Thomson of the Pennsylvania once say he would rather\r\nhave him at a burnt bridge than all the engineering corps. There was\r\none subject upon which the Colonel displayed great weakness\r\n(fortunately for us) and that was the horse. Whenever a business\r\ndiscussion became too warm, and the Colonel showed signs of temper,\r\nwhich was not seldom, it was a sure cure to introduce that subject.\r\nEverything else would pass from his mind; he became absorbed in the\r\nfascinating topic of horseflesh. If he had overworked himself, and we\r\nwished to get him to take a holiday, we sent him to Kentucky to look\r\nafter a horse or two that one or the other of us was desirous of\r\nobtaining, and for the selection of which we would trust no one but\r\nhimself. But his craze for horses sometimes brought him into serious\r\ndifficulties. He made his appearance at the office one day with one\r\nhalf of his face as black as mud could make it, his clothes torn, and\r\nhis hat missing, but still holding the whip in one hand. He explained\r\nthat he had attempted to drive a fast Kentucky colt; one of the reins\r\nhad broken and he had lost his \"steerage-way,\" as he expressed it.\r\n\r\nHe was a grand fellow, \"Pipe\" as we called him, and when he took a\r\nfancy to a person, as he did to me, he was for and with him always. In\r\nlater days when I removed to New York he transferred his affections to\r\nmy brother, whom he invariably called Thomas, instead of Tom. High as\r\nI stood in his favor, my brother afterwards stood higher. He fairly\r\nworshiped him, and anything that Tom said was law and gospel. He was\r\nexceedingly jealous of our other establishments, in which he was not\r\ndirectly interested, such as our mills which supplied the Keystone\r\nWorks with iron. Many a dispute arose between the mill managers and\r\nthe Colonel as to quality, price, and so forth. On one occasion he\r\ncame to my brother to complain that a bargain which he had made for\r\nthe supply of iron for a year had not been copied correctly. The\r\nprices were \"net,\" and nothing had been said about \"net\" when the\r\nbargain was made. He wanted to know just what that word \"net\" meant.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Colonel,\" said my brother, \"it means that nothing more is to be\r\nadded.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Thomas,\" said the Colonel, entirely satisfied.\r\n\r\nThere is much in the way one puts things. \"Nothing to be deducted\"\r\nmight have caused a dispute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS MORRISON CARNEGIE]\r\n\r\nHe was made furious one day by Bradstreet's volume which gives the\r\nstanding of business concerns. Never having seen such a book before,\r\nhe was naturally anxious to see what rating his concern had. When he\r\nread that the Keystone Bridge Works were \"BC,\" which meant \"Bad\r\nCredit,\" it was with difficulty he was restrained from going to see\r\nour lawyers to have a suit brought against the publishers. Tom,\r\nhowever, explained to him that the Keystone Bridge Works were in bad\r\ncredit because they never borrowed anything, and he was pacified. No\r\ndebt was one of the Colonel's hobbies. Once, when I was leaving for\r\nEurope, when many firms were hard up and some failing around us, he\r\nsaid to me:\r\n\r\n\"The sheriff can't get us when you are gone if I don't sign any notes,\r\ncan he?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said, \"he can't.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, we'll be here when you come back.\"\r\n\r\nTalking of the Colonel reminds me of another unusual character with\r\nwhom we were brought in contact in these bridge-building days. This\r\nwas Captain Eads, of St. Louis,[26] an original genius _minus_\r\nscientific knowledge to guide his erratic ideas of things mechanical.\r\nHe was seemingly one of those who wished to have everything done upon\r\nhis own original plans. That a thing had been done in one way before\r\nwas sufficient to cause its rejection. When his plans for the St.\r\nLouis Bridge were presented to us, I handed them to the one man in the\r\nUnited States who knew the subject best--our Mr. Linville. He came to\r\nme in great concern, saying:\r\n\r\n\"The bridge if built upon these plans will not stand up; it will not\r\ncarry its own weight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I said, \"Captain Eads will come to see you and in talking over\r\nmatters explain this to him gently, get it into proper shape, lead him\r\ninto the straight path and say nothing about it to others.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Captain James B. Eads, afterward famous for his jetty\r\nsystem in the Mississippi River.]\r\n\r\nThis was successfully accomplished; but in the construction of the\r\nbridge poor Piper was totally unable to comply with the extraordinary\r\nrequirements of the Captain. At first he was so delighted with having\r\nreceived the largest contract that had yet been let that he was all\r\ngraciousness to Captain Eads. It was not even \"Captain\" at first, but\r\n\"'Colonel' Eads, how do you do? Delighted to see you.\" By and by\r\nmatters became a little complicated. We noticed that the greeting\r\nbecame less cordial, but still it was \"Good-morning, Captain Eads.\"\r\nThis fell till we were surprised to hear \"Pipe\" talking of \"Mr. Eads.\"\r\nBefore the troubles were over, the \"Colonel\" had fallen to \"Jim Eads,\"\r\nand to tell the truth, long before the work was out of the shops,\r\n\"Jim\" was now and then preceded by a big \"D.\" A man may be possessed\r\nof great ability, and be a charming, interesting character, as Captain\r\nEads undoubtedly was, and yet not be able to construct the first\r\nbridge of five hundred feet span over the Mississippi River,[27]\r\nwithout availing himself of the scientific knowledge and practical\r\nexperience of others.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: The span was 515 feet, and at that time considered the\r\nfinest metal arch in the world.]\r\n\r\nWhen the work was finished, I had the Colonel with me in St. Louis for\r\nsome days protecting the bridge against a threatened attempt on the\r\npart of others to take possession of it before we obtained full\r\npayment. When the Colonel had taken up the planks at both ends, and\r\norganized a plan of relieving the men who stood guard, he became\r\nhomesick and exceedingly anxious to return to Pittsburgh. He had\r\ndetermined to take the night train and I was at a loss to know how to\r\nkeep him with me until I thought of his one vulnerable point. I told\r\nhim, during the day, how anxious I was to obtain a pair of horses for\r\nmy sister. I wished to make her a present of a span, and I had heard\r\nthat St. Louis was a noted place for them. Had he seen anything\r\nsuperb?\r\n\r\nThe bait took. He launched forth into a description of several spans\r\nof horses he had seen and stables he had visited. I asked him if he\r\ncould possibly stay over and select the horses. I knew very well that\r\nhe would wish to see them and drive them many times which would keep\r\nhim busy. It happened just as I expected. He purchased a splendid\r\npair, but then another difficulty occurred about transporting them to\r\nPittsburgh. He would not trust them by rail and no suitable boat was\r\nto leave for several days. Providence was on my side evidently.\r\nNothing on earth would induce that man to leave the city until he saw\r\nthose horses fairly started and it was an even wager whether he would\r\nnot insist upon going up on the steamer with them himself. We held the\r\nbridge. \"Pipe\" made a splendid Horatius. He was one of the best men\r\nand one of the most valuable partners I ever was favored with, and\r\nrichly deserved the rewards which he did so much to secure.\r\n\r\nThe Keystone Bridge Works have always been a source of satisfaction to\r\nme. Almost every concern that had undertaken to erect iron bridges in\r\nAmerica had failed. Many of the structures themselves had fallen and\r\nsome of the worst railway disasters in America had been caused in that\r\nway. Some of the bridges had given way under wind pressure but nothing\r\nhas ever happened to a Keystone bridge, and some of them have stood\r\nwhere the wind was not tempered. There has been no luck about it. We\r\nused only the best material and enough of it, making our own iron and\r\nlater our own steel. We were our own severest inspectors, and would\r\nbuild a safe structure or none at all. When asked to build a bridge\r\nwhich we knew to be of insufficient strength or of unscientific\r\ndesign, we resolutely declined. Any piece of work bearing the stamp of\r\nthe Keystone Bridge Works (and there are few States in the Union where\r\nsuch are not to be found) we were prepared to underwrite. We were as\r\nproud of our bridges as Carlyle was of the bridge his father built\r\nacross the Annan. \"An honest brig,\" as the great son rightly said.\r\n\r\nThis policy is the true secret of success. Uphill work it will be for\r\na few years until your work is proven, but after that it is smooth\r\nsailing. Instead of objecting to inspectors they should be welcomed by\r\nall manufacturing establishments. A high standard of excellence is\r\neasily maintained, and men are educated in the effort to reach\r\nexcellence. I have never known a concern to make a decided success\r\nthat did not do good, honest work, and even in these days of the\r\nfiercest competition, when everything would seem to be matter of\r\nprice, there lies still at the root of great business success the very\r\nmuch more important factor of quality. The effect of attention to\r\nquality, upon every man in the service, from the president of the\r\nconcern down to the humblest laborer, cannot be overestimated. And\r\nbearing on the same question, clean, fine workshops and tools,\r\nwell-kept yards and surroundings are of much greater importance than\r\nis usually supposed.\r\n\r\nI was very much pleased to hear a remark, made by one of the prominent\r\nbankers who visited the Edgar Thomson Works during a Bankers\r\nConvention held at Pittsburgh. He was one of a party of some hundreds\r\nof delegates, and after they had passed through the works he said to\r\nour manager:\r\n\r\n\"Somebody appears to belong to these works.\"\r\n\r\nHe put his finger there upon one of the secrets of success. They did\r\nbelong to somebody. The president of an important manufacturing work\r\nonce boasted to me that their men had chased away the first inspector\r\nwho had ventured to appear among them, and that they had never been\r\ntroubled with another since. This was said as a matter of sincere\r\ncongratulation, but I thought to myself: \"This concern will never\r\nstand the strain of competition; it is bound to fail when hard times\r\ncome.\" The result proved the correctness of my belief. The surest\r\nfoundation of a manufacturing concern is quality. After that, and a\r\nlong way after, comes cost.\r\n\r\nI gave a great deal of personal attention for some years to the\r\naffairs of the Keystone Bridge Works, and when important contracts\r\nwere involved often went myself to meet the parties. On one such\r\noccasion in 1868, I visited Dubuque, Iowa, with our engineer, Walter\r\nKatte. We were competing for the building of the most important\r\nrailway bridge that had been built up to that time, a bridge across\r\nthe wide Mississippi at Dubuque, to span which was considered a great\r\nundertaking. We found the river frozen and crossed it upon a sleigh\r\ndrawn by four horses.\r\n\r\nThat visit proved how much success turns upon trifles. We found we\r\nwere not the lowest bidder. Our chief rival was a bridge-building\r\nconcern in Chicago to which the board had decided to award the\r\ncontract. I lingered and talked with some of the directors. They were\r\ndelightfully ignorant of the merits of cast- and wrought-iron. We had\r\nalways made the upper cord of the bridge of the latter, while our\r\nrivals' was made of cast-iron. This furnished my text. I pictured the\r\nresult of a steamer striking against the one and against the other. In\r\nthe case of the wrought-iron cord it would probably only bend; in the\r\ncase of the cast-iron it would certainly break and down would come the\r\nbridge. One of the directors, the well-known Perry Smith, was\r\nfortunately able to enforce my argument, by stating to the board that\r\nwhat I said was undoubtedly the case about cast-iron. The other night\r\nhe had run his buggy in the dark against a lamp-post which was of\r\ncast-iron and the lamp-post had broken to pieces. Am I to be censured\r\nif I had little difficulty here in recognizing something akin to the\r\nhand of Providence, with Perry Smith the manifest agent?\r\n\r\n\"Ah, gentlemen,\" I said, \"there is the point. A little more money and\r\nyou could have had the indestructible wrought-iron and your bridge\r\nwould stand against any steamboat. We never have built and we never\r\nwill build a cheap bridge. Ours don't fall.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause; then the president of the bridge company, Mr.\r\nAllison, the great Senator, asked if I would excuse them for a few\r\nmoments. I retired. Soon they recalled me and offered the contract,\r\nprovided we took the lower price, which was only a few thousand\r\ndollars less. I agreed to the concession. That cast-iron lamp-post so\r\nopportunely smashed gave us one of our most profitable contracts and,\r\nwhat is more, obtained for us the reputation of having taken the\r\nDubuque bridge against all competitors. It also laid the foundation\r\nfor me of a lifelong, unbroken friendship with one of America's best\r\nand most valuable public men, Senator Allison.\r\n\r\nThe moral of that story lies on the surface. If you want a contract,\r\nbe on the spot when it is let. A smashed lamp-post or something\r\nequally unthought of may secure the prize if the bidder be on hand.\r\nAnd if possible stay on hand until you can take the written contract\r\nhome in your pocket. This we did at Dubuque, although it was suggested\r\nwe could leave and it would be sent after us to execute. We preferred\r\nto remain, being anxious to see more of the charms of Dubuque.\r\n\r\nAfter building the Steubenville Bridge, it became a necessity for the\r\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad Company to build bridges across the Ohio\r\nRiver at Parkersburg and Wheeling, to prevent their great rival, the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad Company, from possessing a decided advantage.\r\nThe days of ferryboats were then fast passing away. It was in\r\nconnection with the contracts for these bridges that I had the\r\npleasure of making the acquaintance of a man, then of great position,\r\nMr. Garrett, president of the Baltimore and Ohio.\r\n\r\nWe were most anxious to secure both bridges and all the approaches to\r\nthem, but I found Mr. Garrett decidedly of the opinion that we were\r\nquite unable to do so much work in the time specified. He wished to\r\nbuild the approaches and the short spans in his own shops, and asked\r\nme if we would permit him to use our patents. I replied that we would\r\nfeel highly honored by the Baltimore and Ohio doing so. The stamp of\r\napproval of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad would be worth ten times\r\nthe patent fees. He could use all, and everything, we had.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt as to the favorable impression that made upon the\r\ngreat railway magnate. He was much pleased and, to my utter surprise,\r\ntook me into his private room and opened up a frank conversation upon\r\nmatters in general. He touched especially upon his quarrels with the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad people, with Mr. Thomson and Mr. Scott, the\r\npresident and vice-president, whom he knew to be my special friends.\r\nThis led me to say that I had passed through Philadelphia on my way to\r\nsee him and had been asked by Mr. Scott where I was going.\r\n\r\n\"I told him that I was going to visit you to obtain the contracts for\r\nyour great bridges over the Ohio River. Mr. Scott said it was not\r\noften that I went on a fool's errand, but that I was certainly on one\r\nnow; that Mr. Garrett would never think for a moment of giving me his\r\ncontracts, for every one knew that I was, as a former employee, always\r\nfriendly to the Pennsylvania Railroad. Well, I said, we shall build\r\nMr. Garrett's bridges.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Garrett promptly replied that when the interests of his company\r\nwere at stake it was the best always that won. His engineers had\r\nreported that our plans were the best and that Scott and Thomson would\r\nsee that he had only one rule--the interests of his company. Although\r\nhe very well knew that I was a Pennsylvania Railroad man, yet he felt\r\nit his duty to award us the work.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation was still unsatisfactory to me, because we were to get\r\nall the difficult part of the work--the great spans of which the risk\r\nwas then considerable--while Mr. Garrett was to build all the small\r\nand profitable spans at his own shops upon our plans and patents. I\r\nventured to ask whether he was dividing the work because he honestly\r\nbelieved we could not open his bridges for traffic as soon as his\r\nmasonry would permit. He admitted he was. I told him that he need not\r\nhave any fear upon that point.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Garrett,\" I said, \"would you consider my personal bond a good\r\nsecurity?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now,\" I replied, \"bind me! I know what I am doing. I will take\r\nthe risk. How much of a bond do you want me to give you that your\r\nbridges will be opened for traffic at the specified time if you give\r\nus the entire contract, provided you get your masonry ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I would want a hundred thousand dollars from you, young man.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" I said, \"prepare your bond. Give us the work. Our firm is\r\nnot going to let me lose a hundred thousand dollars. You know that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I believe if you are bound for a hundred thousand\r\ndollars your company will work day and night and I will get my\r\nbridges.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the arrangement which gave us what were then the gigantic\r\ncontracts of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. It is needless to say\r\nthat I never had to pay that bond. My partners knew much better than\r\nMr. Garrett the conditions of his work. The Ohio River was not to be\r\ntrifled with, and long before his masonry was ready we had relieved\r\nourselves from all responsibility upon the bond by placing the\r\nsuperstructure on the banks awaiting the completion of the\r\nsubstructure which he was still building.\r\n\r\nMr. Garrett was very proud of his Scottish blood, and Burns having\r\nbeen once touched upon between us we became firm friends. He\r\nafterwards took me to his fine mansion in the country. He was one of\r\nthe few Americans who then lived in the grand style of a country\r\ngentleman, with many hundreds of acres of beautiful land, park-like\r\ndrives, a stud of thoroughbred horses, with cattle, sheep, and dogs,\r\nand a home that realized what one had read of the country life of a\r\nnobleman in England.\r\n\r\nAt a later date he had fully determined that his railroad company\r\nshould engage in the manufacture of steel rails and had applied for\r\nthe right to use the Bessemer patents. This was a matter of great\r\nmoment to us. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company was one of our\r\nbest customers, and we were naturally anxious to prevent the building\r\nof steel-rail rolling mills at Cumberland. It would have been a losing\r\nenterprise for the Baltimore and Ohio, for I was sure it could buy its\r\nsteel rails at a much cheaper rate than it could possibly make the\r\nsmall quantity needed for itself. I visited Mr. Garrett to talk the\r\nmatter over with him. He was then much pleased with the foreign\r\ncommerce and the lines of steamships which made Baltimore their port.\r\nHe drove me, accompanied by several of his staff, to the wharves where\r\nhe was to decide about their extension, and as the foreign goods were\r\nbeing discharged from the steamship side and placed in the railway\r\ncars, he turned to me and said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Carnegie, you can now begin to appreciate the magnitude of our\r\nvast system and understand why it is necessary that we should make\r\neverything for ourselves, even our steel rails. We cannot depend upon\r\nprivate concerns to supply us with any of the principal articles we\r\nconsume. We shall be a world to ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I said, \"Mr. Garrett, it is all very grand, but really your\r\n'vast system' does not overwhelm me. I read your last annual report\r\nand saw that you collected last year for transporting the goods of\r\nothers the sum of fourteen millions of dollars. The firms I control\r\ndug the material from the hills, made their own goods, and sold them\r\nto a much greater value than that. You are really a very small concern\r\ncompared with Carnegie Brothers and Company.\"\r\n\r\nMy railroad apprenticeship came in there to advantage. We heard no\r\nmore of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company entering into\r\ncompetition with us. Mr. Garrett and I remained good friends to the\r\nend. He even presented me with a Scotch collie dog of his own rearing.\r\nThat I had been a Pennsylvania Railroad man was drowned in the \"wee\r\ndrap o' Scotch bluid atween us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE IRON WORKS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Keystone Works have always been my pet as being the parent of all\r\nthe other works. But they had not been long in existence before the\r\nadvantage of wrought- over cast-iron became manifest. Accordingly, to\r\ninsure uniform quality, and also to make certain shapes which were not\r\nthen to be obtained, we determined to embark in the manufacture of\r\niron. My brother and I became interested with Thomas N. Miller, Henry\r\nPhipps, and Andrew Kloman in a small iron mill. Miller was the first\r\nto embark with Kloman and he brought Phipps in, lending him eight\r\nhundred dollars to buy a one-sixth interest, in November, 1861.\r\n\r\nI must not fail to record that Mr. Miller was the pioneer of our iron\r\nmanufacturing projects. We were all indebted to Tom, who still lives\r\n(July 20, 1911) and sheds upon us the sweetness and light of a most\r\nlovable nature, a friend who grows more precious as the years roll by.\r\nHe has softened by age, and even his outbursts against theology as\r\nantagonistic to true religion are in his fine old age much less\r\nalarming. We are all prone to grow philosophic in age, and perhaps\r\nthis is well. [In re-reading this--July 19, 1912--in our retreat upon\r\nthe high moors at Aultnagar, I drop a tear for my bosom friend, dear\r\nTom Miller, who died in Pittsburgh last winter. Mrs. Carnegie and I\r\nattended his funeral. Henceforth life lacks something, lacks much--my\r\nfirst partner in early years, my dearest friend in old age. May I go\r\nwhere he is, wherever that may be.]\r\n\r\nAndrew Kloman had a small steel-hammer in Allegheny City. As a\r\nsuperintendent of the Pennsylvania Railroad I had found that he made\r\nthe best axles. He was a great mechanic--one who had discovered, what\r\nwas then unknown in Pittsburgh, that whatever was worth doing with\r\nmachinery was worth doing well. His German mind made him thorough.\r\nWhat he constructed cost enormously, but when once started it did the\r\nwork it was intended to do from year's end to year's end. In those\r\nearly days it was a question with axles generally whether they would\r\nrun any specified time or break. There was no analysis of material, no\r\nscientific treatment of it.\r\n\r\nHow much this German created! He was the first man to introduce the\r\ncold saw that cut cold iron the exact lengths. He invented upsetting\r\nmachines to make bridge links, and also built the first \"universal\"\r\nmill in America. All these were erected at our works. When Captain\r\nEads could not obtain the couplings for the St. Louis Bridge arches\r\n(the contractors failing to make them) and matters were at a\r\nstandstill, Kloman told us that he could make them and why the others\r\nhad failed. He succeeded in making them. Up to that date they were the\r\nlargest semicircles that had ever been rolled. Our confidence in Mr.\r\nKloman may be judged from the fact that when he said he could make\r\nthem we unhesitatingly contracted to furnish them.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of the intimacy between our family and that of\r\nthe Phippses. In the early days my chief companion was the elder\r\nbrother, John. Henry was several years my junior, but had not failed\r\nto attract my attention as a bright, clever lad. One day he asked his\r\nbrother John to lend him a quarter of a dollar. John saw that he had\r\nimportant use for it and handed him the shining quarter without\r\ninquiry. Next morning an advertisement appeared in the \"Pittsburgh\r\nDispatch\":\r\n\r\n\"A willing boy wishes work.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the use the energetic and willing Harry had made of his\r\nquarter, probably the first quarter he had ever spent at one time in\r\nhis life. A response came from the well-known firm of Dilworth and\r\nBidwell. They asked the \"willing boy\" to call. Harry went and obtained\r\na position as errand boy, and as was then the custom, his first duty\r\nevery morning was to sweep the office. He went to his parents and\r\nobtained their consent, and in this way the young lad launched himself\r\nupon the sea of business. There was no holding back a boy like that.\r\nIt was the old story. He soon became indispensable to his employers,\r\nobtained a small interest in a collateral branch of their business;\r\nand then, ever on the alert, it was not many years before he attracted\r\nthe attention of Mr. Miller, who made a small investment for him with\r\nAndrew Kloman. That finally resulted in the building of the iron mill\r\nin Twenty-Ninth Street. He had been a schoolmate and great crony of my\r\nbrother Tom. As children they had played together, and throughout\r\nlife, until my brother's death in 1886, these two formed, as it were,\r\na partnership within a partnership. They invariably held equal\r\ninterests in the various firms with which they were connected. What\r\none did the other did.\r\n\r\nThe errand boy is now one of the richest men in the United States and\r\nhas begun to prove that he knows how to expend his surplus. Years ago\r\nhe gave beautiful conservatories to the public parks of Allegheny and\r\nPittsburgh. That he specified \"that these should be open upon Sunday\"\r\nshows that he is a man of his time. This clause in the gift created\r\nmuch excitement. Ministers denounced him from the pulpit and\r\nassemblies of the church passed resolutions declaring against the\r\ndesecration of the Lord's Day. But the people rose, _en masse_,\r\nagainst this narrow-minded contention and the Council of the city\r\naccepted the gift with acclamation. The sound common sense of my\r\npartner was well expressed when he said in reply to a remonstrance by\r\nministers:\r\n\r\n\"It is all very well for you, gentlemen, who work one day in the week\r\nand are masters of your time the other six during which you can view\r\nthe beauties of Nature--all very well for you--but I think it shameful\r\nthat you should endeavor to shut out from the toiling masses all that\r\nis calculated to entertain and instruct them during the only day which\r\nyou well know they have at their disposal.\"\r\n\r\nThese same ministers have recently been quarreling in their convention\r\nat Pittsburgh upon the subject of instrumental music in churches. But\r\nwhile they are debating whether it is right to have organs in\r\nchurches, intelligent people are opening museums, conservatories, and\r\nlibraries upon the Sabbath; and unless the pulpit soon learns how to\r\nmeet the real wants of the people in this life (where alone men's\r\nduties lie) much better than it is doing at present, these rival\r\nclaimants for popular favor may soon empty their churches.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Kloman and Phipps soon differed with Miller about the\r\nbusiness and forced him out. Being convinced that Miller was unfairly\r\ntreated, I united with him in building new works. These were the\r\nCyclops Mills of 1864. After they were set running it became possible,\r\nand therefore advisable, to unite the old and the new works, and the\r\nUnion Iron Mills were formed by their consolidation in 1867. I did\r\nnot believe that Mr. Miller's reluctance to associate again with his\r\nformer partners, Phipps and Kloman, could not be overcome, because\r\nthey would not control the Union Works. Mr. Miller, my brother, and I\r\nwould hold the controlling interest. But Mr. Miller proved obdurate\r\nand begged me to buy his interest, which I reluctantly did after all\r\nefforts had failed to induce him to let bygones be bygones. He was\r\nIrish, and the Irish blood when aroused is uncontrollable. Mr. Miller\r\nhas since regretted (to me) his refusal of my earnest request, which\r\nwould have enabled the pioneer of all of us to reap what was only his\r\nrightful reward--millionairedom for himself and his followers.\r\n\r\nWe were young in manufacturing then and obtained for the Cyclops Mills\r\nwhat was considered at the time an enormous extent of land--seven\r\nacres. For some years we offered to lease a portion of the ground to\r\nothers. It soon became a question whether we could continue the\r\nmanufacture of iron within so small an area. Mr. Kloman succeeded in\r\nmaking iron beams and for many years our mill was far in advance of\r\nany other in that respect. We began at the new mill by making all\r\nshapes which were required, and especially such as no other concern\r\nwould undertake, depending upon an increasing demand in our growing\r\ncountry for things that were only rarely needed at first. What others\r\ncould not or would not do we would attempt, and this was a rule of our\r\nbusiness which was strictly adhered to. Also we would make nothing\r\nexcept of excellent quality. We always accommodated our customers,\r\neven although at some expense to ourselves, and in cases of dispute we\r\ngave the other party the benefit of the doubt and settled. These were\r\nour rules. We had no lawsuits.\r\n\r\nAs I became acquainted with the manufacture of iron I was greatly\r\nsurprised to find that the cost of each of the various processes was\r\nunknown. Inquiries made of the leading manufacturers of Pittsburgh\r\nproved this. It was a lump business, and until stock was taken and the\r\nbooks balanced at the end of the year, the manufacturers were in total\r\nignorance of results. I heard of men who thought their business at the\r\nend of the year would show a loss and had found a profit, and\r\n_vice-versa_. I felt as if we were moles burrowing in the dark, and\r\nthis to me was intolerable. I insisted upon such a system of weighing\r\nand accounting being introduced throughout our works as would enable\r\nus to know what our cost was for each process and especially what each\r\nman was doing, who saved material, who wasted it, and who produced the\r\nbest results.\r\n\r\nTo arrive at this was a much more difficult task than one would\r\nimagine. Every manager in the mills was naturally against the new\r\nsystem. Years were required before an accurate system was obtained,\r\nbut eventually, by the aid of many clerks and the introduction of\r\nweighing scales at various points in the mill, we began to know not\r\nonly what every department was doing, but what each one of the many\r\nmen working at the furnaces was doing, and thus to compare one with\r\nanother. One of the chief sources of success in manufacturing is the\r\nintroduction and strict maintenance of a perfect system of accounting\r\nso that responsibility for money or materials can be brought home to\r\nevery man. Owners who, in the office, would not trust a clerk with\r\nfive dollars without having a check upon him, were supplying tons of\r\nmaterial daily to men in the mills without exacting an account of\r\ntheir stewardship by weighing what each returned in the finished\r\nform.\r\n\r\nThe Siemens Gas Furnace had been used to some extent in Great Britain\r\nfor heating steel and iron, but it was supposed to be too expensive. I\r\nwell remember the criticisms made by older heads among the Pittsburgh\r\nmanufacturers about the extravagant expenditure we were making upon\r\nthese new-fangled furnaces. But in the heating of great masses of\r\nmaterial, almost half the waste could sometimes be saved by using the\r\nnew furnaces. The expenditure would have been justified, even if it\r\nhad been doubled. Yet it was many years before we were followed in\r\nthis new departure; and in some of those years the margin of profit\r\nwas so small that the most of it was made up from the savings derived\r\nfrom the adoption of the improved furnaces.\r\n\r\nOur strict system of accounting enabled us to detect the great waste\r\npossible in heating large masses of iron. This improvement revealed to\r\nus a valuable man in a clerk, William Borntraeger, a distant relative\r\nof Mr. Kloman, who came from Germany. He surprised us one day by\r\npresenting a detailed statement showing results for a period, which\r\nseemed incredible. All the needed labor in preparing this statement he\r\nhad performed at night unasked and unknown to us. The form adapted was\r\nuniquely original. Needless to say, William soon became superintendent\r\nof the works and later a partner, and the poor German lad died a\r\nmillionaire. He well deserved his fortune.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1862 that the great oil wells of Pennsylvania attracted\r\nattention. My friend Mr. William Coleman, whose daughter became, at a\r\nlater date, my sister-in-law, was deeply interested in the discovery,\r\nand nothing would do but that I should take a trip with him to the oil\r\nregions. It was a most interesting excursion. There had been a rush to\r\nthe oil fields and the influx was so great that it was impossible for\r\nall to obtain shelter. This, however, to the class of men who flocked\r\nthither, was but a slight drawback. A few hours sufficed to knock up a\r\nshanty, and it was surprising in how short a time they were able to\r\nsurround themselves with many of the comforts of life. They were men\r\nabove the average, men who had saved considerable sums and were able\r\nto venture something in the search for fortune.\r\n\r\nWhat surprised me was the good humor which prevailed everywhere. It\r\nwas a vast picnic, full of amusing incidents. Everybody was in high\r\nglee; fortunes were supposedly within reach; everything was booming.\r\nOn the tops of the derricks floated flags on which strange mottoes\r\nwere displayed. I remember looking down toward the river and seeing\r\ntwo men working their treadles boring for oil upon the banks of the\r\nstream, and inscribed upon their flag was \"Hell or China.\" They were\r\ngoing down, no matter how far.\r\n\r\nThe adaptability of the American was never better displayed than in\r\nthis region. Order was soon evolved out of chaos. When we visited the\r\nplace not long after we were serenaded by a brass band the players of\r\nwhich were made up of the new inhabitants along the creek. It would be\r\nsafe to wager that a thousand Americans in a new land would organize\r\nthemselves, establish schools, churches, newspapers, and brass\r\nbands--in short, provide themselves with all the appliances of\r\ncivilization--and go ahead developing their country before an equal\r\nnumber of British would have discovered who among them was the highest\r\nin hereditary rank and had the best claims to leadership owing to his\r\ngrandfather. There is but one rule among Americans--the tools to those\r\nwho can use them.\r\n\r\nTo-day Oil Creek is a town of many thousand inhabitants, as is also\r\nTitusville at the other end of the creek. The district which began by\r\nfurnishing a few barrels of oil every season, gathered with blankets\r\nfrom the surface of the creek by the Seneca Indians, has now several\r\ntowns and refineries, with millions of dollars of capital. In those\r\nearly days all the arrangements were of the crudest character. When\r\nthe oil was obtained it was run into flat-bottomed boats which leaked\r\nbadly. Water ran into the boats and the oil overflowed into the river.\r\nThe creek was dammed at various places, and upon a stipulated day and\r\nhour the dams were opened and upon the flood the oil boats floated to\r\nthe Allegheny River, and thence to Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nIn this way not only the creek, but the Allegheny River, became\r\nliterally covered with oil. The loss involved in transportation to\r\nPittsburgh was estimated at fully a third of the total quantity, and\r\nbefore the oil boats started it is safe to say that another third was\r\nlost by leakage. The oil gathered by the Indians in the early days was\r\nbottled in Pittsburgh and sold at high prices as medicine--a dollar\r\nfor a small vial. It had general reputation as a sure cure for\r\nrheumatic tendencies. As it became plentiful and cheap its virtues\r\nvanished. What fools we mortals be!\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated wells were upon the Storey farm. Upon these we\r\nobtained an option of purchase for forty thousand dollars. We bought\r\nthem. Mr. Coleman, ever ready at suggestion, proposed to make a lake\r\nof oil by excavating a pool sufficient to hold a hundred thousand\r\nbarrels (the waste to be made good every day by running streams of oil\r\ninto it), and to hold it for the not far distant day when, as we then\r\nexpected, the oil supply would cease. This was promptly acted upon,\r\nbut after losing many thousands of barrels waiting for the expected\r\nday (which has not yet arrived) we abandoned the reserve. Coleman\r\npredicted that when the supply stopped, oil would bring ten dollars a\r\nbarrel and therefore we would have a million dollars worth in the\r\nlake. We did not think then of Nature's storehouse below which still\r\nkeeps on yielding many thousands of barrels per day without apparent\r\nexhaustion.\r\n\r\nThis forty-thousand-dollar investment proved for us the best of all so\r\nfar. The revenues from it came at the most opportune time.[28] The\r\nbuilding of the new mill in Pittsburgh required not only all the\r\ncapital we could gather, but the use of our credit, which I consider,\r\nlooking backward, was remarkably good for young men.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: The wells on the Storey farm paid in one year a million\r\ndollars in cash and dividends, and the farm itself eventually became\r\nworth, on a stock basis, five million dollars.]\r\n\r\nHaving become interested in this oil venture, I made several\r\nexcursions to the district and also, in 1864, to an oil field in Ohio\r\nwhere a great well had been struck which yielded a peculiar quality of\r\noil well fitted for lubricating purposes. My journey thither with Mr.\r\nColeman and Mr. David Ritchie was one of the strangest experiences I\r\never had. We left the railway line some hundreds of miles from\r\nPittsburgh and plunged through a sparsely inhabited district to the\r\nwaters of Duck Creek to see the monster well. We bought it before\r\nleaving.\r\n\r\nIt was upon our return that adventures began. The weather had been\r\nfine and the roads quite passable during our journey thither, but rain\r\nhad set in during our stay. We started back in our wagon, but before\r\ngoing far fell into difficulties. The road had become a mass of soft,\r\ntenacious mud and our wagon labored fearfully. The rain fell in\r\ntorrents, and it soon became evident that we were in for a night of\r\nit. Mr. Coleman lay at full length on one side of the wagon, and Mr.\r\nRitchie on the other, and I, being then very thin, weighing not much\r\nmore than a hundred pounds, was nicely sandwiched between the two\r\nportly gentlemen. Every now and then the wagon proceeded a few feet\r\nheaving up and down in the most outrageous manner, and finally\r\nsticking fast. In this fashion we passed the night. There was in front\r\na seat across the wagon, under which we got our heads, and in spite of\r\nour condition the night was spent in uproarious merriment.\r\n\r\nBy the next night we succeeded in reaching a country town in the worst\r\npossible plight. We saw the little frame church of the town lighted\r\nand heard the bell ringing. We had just reached our tavern when a\r\ncommittee appeared stating that they had been waiting for us and that\r\nthe congregation was assembled. It appears that a noted exhorter had\r\nbeen expected who had no doubt been delayed as we had been. I was\r\ntaken for the absentee minister and asked how soon I would be ready to\r\naccompany them to the meeting-house. I was almost prepared with my\r\ncompanions to carry out the joke (we were in for fun), but I found I\r\nwas too exhausted with fatigue to attempt it. I had never before come\r\nso near occupying a pulpit.\r\n\r\nMy investments now began to require so much of my personal attention\r\nthat I resolved to leave the service of the railway company and devote\r\nmyself exclusively to my own affairs. I had been honored a short time\r\nbefore this decision by being called by President Thomson to\r\nPhiladelphia. He desired to promote me to the office of assistant\r\ngeneral superintendent with headquarters at Altoona under Mr. Lewis. I\r\ndeclined, telling him that I had decided to give up the railroad\r\nservice altogether, that I was determined to make a fortune and I saw\r\nno means of doing this honestly at any salary the railroad company\r\ncould afford to give, and I would not do it by indirection. When I lay\r\ndown at night I was going to get a verdict of approval from the\r\nhighest of all tribunals, the judge within.\r\n\r\nI repeated this in my parting letter to President Thomson, who warmly\r\ncongratulated me upon it in his letter of reply. I resigned my\r\nposition March 28, 1865, and received from the men on the railway a\r\ngold watch. This and Mr. Thomson's letter I treasure among my most\r\nprecious mementos.\r\n\r\nThe following letter was written to the men on the Division:\r\n\r\n     PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD COMPANY\r\n     SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE, PITTSBURGH DIVISION\r\n     PITTSBURGH, _March 28, 1865_\r\n\r\n     To the Officers and Employees of the Pittsburgh Division\r\n\r\n     GENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\n     I cannot allow my connection with you to cease without some\r\n     expression of the deep regret felt at parting.\r\n\r\n     Twelve years of pleasant intercourse have served to inspire\r\n     feelings of personal regard for those who have so faithfully\r\n     labored with me in the service of the Company. The coming\r\n     change is painful only as I reflect that in consequence\r\n     thereof I am not to be in the future, as in the past,\r\n     intimately associated with you and with many others in the\r\n     various departments, who have through business intercourse,\r\n     become my personal friends. I assure you although the\r\n     official relations hitherto existing between us must soon\r\n     close, I can never fail to feel and evince the liveliest\r\n     interest in the welfare of such as have been identified with\r\n     the Pittsburgh Division in times past, and who are, I trust,\r\n     for many years to come to contribute to the success of the\r\n     Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and share in its justly\r\n     deserved prosperity.\r\n\r\n     Thanking you most sincerely for the uniform kindness shown\r\n     toward me, for your zealous efforts made at all times to\r\n     meet my wishes, and asking for my successor similar support\r\n     at your hands, I bid you all farewell.\r\n\r\n     Very respectfully\r\n\r\n     (Signed) ANDREW CARNEGIE\r\n\r\nThenceforth I never worked for a salary. A man must necessarily occupy\r\na narrow field who is at the beck and call of others. Even if he\r\nbecomes president of a great corporation he is hardly his own master,\r\nunless he holds control of the stock. The ablest presidents are\r\nhampered by boards of directors and shareholders, who can know but\r\nlittle of the business. But I am glad to say that among my best\r\nfriends to-day are those with whom I labored in the service of the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad Company.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1867, Mr. Phipps, Mr. J.W. Vandevort, and myself revisited\r\nEurope, traveling extensively through England and Scotland, and made\r\nthe tour of the Continent. \"Vandy\" had become my closest companion. We\r\nhad both been fired by reading Bayard Taylor's \"Views Afoot.\" It was\r\nin the days of the oil excitement and shares were going up like\r\nrockets. One Sunday, lying in the grass, I said to \"Vandy\":\r\n\r\n\"If you could make three thousand dollars would you spend it in a tour\r\nthrough Europe with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Would a duck swim or an Irishman eat potatoes?\" was his reply.\r\n\r\nThe sum was soon made in oil stock by the investment of a few hundred\r\ndollars which \"Vandy\" had saved. This was the beginning of our\r\nexcursion. We asked my partner, Harry Phipps, who was by this time\r\nquite a capitalist, to join the party. We visited most of the capitals\r\nof Europe, and in all the enthusiasm of youth climbed every spire,\r\nslept on mountain-tops, and carried our luggage in knapsacks upon our\r\nbacks. We ended our journey upon Vesuvius, where we resolved some day\r\nto go around the world.\r\n\r\nThis visit to Europe proved most instructive. Up to this time I had\r\nknown nothing of painting or sculpture, but it was not long before I\r\ncould classify the works of the great painters. One may not at the\r\ntime justly appreciate the advantage he is receiving from examining\r\nthe great masterpieces, but upon his return to America he will find\r\nhimself unconsciously rejecting what before seemed truly beautiful,\r\nand judging productions which come before him by a new standard. That\r\nwhich is truly great has so impressed itself upon him that what is\r\nfalse or pretentious proves no longer attractive.\r\n\r\nMy visit to Europe also gave me my first great treat in music. The\r\nHandel Anniversary was then being celebrated at the Crystal Palace in\r\nLondon, and I had never up to that time, nor have I often since, felt\r\nthe power and majesty of music in such high degree. What I heard at\r\nthe Crystal Palace and what I subsequently heard on the Continent in\r\nthe cathedrals, and at the opera, certainly enlarged my appreciation\r\nof music. At Rome the Pope's choir and the celebrations in the\r\nchurches at Christmas and Easter furnished, as it were, a grand climax\r\nto the whole.\r\n\r\nThese visits to Europe were also of great service in a commercial\r\nsense. One has to get out of the swirl of the great Republic to form a\r\njust estimate of the velocity with which it spins. I felt that a\r\nmanufacturing concern like ours could scarcely develop fast enough for\r\nthe wants of the American people, but abroad nothing seemed to be\r\ngoing forward. If we excepted a few of the capitals of Europe,\r\neverything on the Continent seemed to be almost at a standstill, while\r\nthe Republic represented throughout its entire extent such a scene as\r\nthere must have been at the Tower of Babel, as pictured in the\r\nstory-books--hundreds rushing to and fro, each more active than his\r\nneighbor, and all engaged in constructing the mighty edifice.\r\n\r\nIt was Cousin \"Dod\" (Mr. George Lauder) to whom we were indebted for a\r\nnew development in our mill operations--the first of its kind in\r\nAmerica. He it was who took our Mr. Coleman to Wigan in England and\r\nexplained the process of washing and coking the dross from coal mines.\r\nMr. Coleman had constantly been telling us how grand it would be to\r\nutilize what was then being thrown away at our mines, and was indeed\r\nan expense to dispose of. Our Cousin \"Dod\" was a mechanical engineer,\r\neducated under Lord Kelvin at Glasgow University, and as he\r\ncorroborated all that Mr. Coleman stated, in December, 1871, I\r\nundertook to advance the capital to build works along the line of the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad. Contracts for ten years were made with the\r\nleading coal companies for their dross and with the railway companies\r\nfor transportation, and Mr. Lauder, who came to Pittsburgh and\r\nsuperintended the whole operation for years, began the construction of\r\nthe first coal-washing machinery in America. He made a success of\r\nit--he never failed to do that in any mining or mechanical operation\r\nhe undertook--and he soon cleared the cost of the works. No wonder\r\nthat at a later date my partners desired to embrace the coke works in\r\nour general firm and thus capture not only these, but Lauder also.\r\n\"Dod\" had won his spurs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE LAUDER]\r\n\r\nThe ovens were extended from time to time until we had five hundred of\r\nthem, washing nearly fifteen hundred tons of coal daily. I confess I\r\nnever pass these coal ovens at Larimer's Station without feeling that\r\nif he who makes two blades of grass grow where one grew before is a\r\npublic benefactor and lays the race under obligation, those who\r\nproduce superior coke from material that has been for all previous\r\nyears thrown over the bank as worthless, have great cause for\r\nself-congratulation. It is fine to make something out of nothing; it\r\nis also something to be the first firm to do this upon our continent.\r\n\r\nWe had another valuable partner in a second cousin of mine, a son of\r\nCousin Morrison of Dunfermline. Walking through the shops one day, the\r\nsuperintendent asked me if I knew I had a relative there who was\r\nproving an exceptional mechanic. I replied in the negative and asked\r\nthat I might speak with him on our way around. We met. I asked his\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\"Morrison,\" was the reply, \"son of Robert\"--my cousin Bob.\r\n\r\n\"Well, how did you come here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought we could better ourselves,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Who have you with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"My wife,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you come first to see your relative who might have been\r\nable to introduce you here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I didn't feel I needed help if I only got a chance.\"\r\n\r\nThere spoke the true Morrison, taught to depend on himself, and\r\nindependent as Lucifer. Not long afterwards I heard of his promotion\r\nto the superintendency of our newly acquired works at Duquesne, and\r\nfrom that position he steadily marched upward. He is to-day a\r\nblooming, but still sensible, millionaire. We are all proud of Tom\r\nMorrison. [A note received from him yesterday invites Mrs. Carnegie\r\nand myself to be his guests during our coming visit of a few days at\r\nthe annual celebration of the Carnegie Institute.]\r\n\r\nI was always advising that our iron works should be extended and new\r\ndevelopments made in connection with the manufacture of iron and\r\nsteel, which I saw was only in its infancy. All apprehension of its\r\nfuture development was dispelled by the action of America with regard\r\nto the tariff upon foreign imports. It was clear to my mind that the\r\nCivil War had resulted in a fixed determination upon the part of the\r\nAmerican people to build a nation within itself, independent of Europe\r\nin all things essential to its safety. America had been obliged to\r\nimport all her steel of every form and most of the iron needed,\r\nBritain being the chief seller. The people demanded a home supply and\r\nCongress granted the manufacturers a tariff of twenty-eight per cent\r\n_ad valorem_ on steel rails--the tariff then being equal to about\r\ntwenty-eight dollars per ton. Rails were selling at about a hundred\r\ndollars per ton, and other rates in proportion.\r\n\r\nProtection has played a great part in the development of manufacturing\r\nin the United States. Previous to the Civil War it was a party\r\nquestion, the South standing for free trade and regarding a tariff as\r\nfavorable only to the North. The sympathy shown by the British\r\nGovernment for the Confederacy, culminating in the escape of the\r\nAlabama and other privateers to prey upon American commerce, aroused\r\nhostility against that Government, notwithstanding the majority of her\r\ncommon people favored the United States. The tariff became no longer a\r\nparty question, but a national policy, approved by both parties. It\r\nhad become a patriotic duty to develop vital resources. No less than\r\nninety Northern Democrats in Congress, including the Speaker of the\r\nHouse, agreed upon that point.\r\n\r\nCapital no longer hesitated to embark in manufacturing, confident as\r\nit was that the nation would protect it as long as necessary. Years\r\nafter the war, demands for a reduction of the tariff arose and it was\r\nmy lot to be drawn into the controversy. It was often charged that\r\nbribery of Congressmen by manufacturers was common. So far as I know\r\nthere was no foundation for this. Certainly the manufacturers never\r\nraised any sums beyond those needed to maintain the Iron and Steel\r\nAssociation, a matter of a few thousand dollars per year. They did,\r\nhowever, subscribe freely to a campaign when the issue was Protection\r\n_versus_ Free Trade.\r\n\r\nThe duties upon steel were successively reduced, with my cordial\r\nsupport, until the twenty-eight dollars duty on rails became only one\r\nfourth or seven dollars per ton. [To-day (1911) the duty is only about\r\none half of that, and even that should go in the next revision.] The\r\neffort of President Cleveland to pass a more drastic new tariff was\r\ninteresting. It cut too deep in many places and its passage would have\r\ninjured more than one manufacture. I was called to Washington, and\r\ntried to modify and, as I believe, improve, the Wilson Bill. Senator\r\nGorman, Democratic leader of the Senate, Governor Flower of New York,\r\nand a number of the ablest Democrats were as sound protectionists in\r\nmoderation as I was. Several of these were disposed to oppose the\r\nWilson Bill as being unnecessarily severe and certain to cripple some\r\nof our domestic industries. Senator Gorman said to me he wished as\r\nlittle as I did to injure any home producer, and he thought his\r\ncolleagues had confidence in and would be guided by me as to iron and\r\nsteel rates, provided that large reductions were made and that the\r\nRepublican Senators would stand unitedly for a bill of that character.\r\nI remember his words, \"I can afford to fight the President and beat\r\nhim, but I can't afford to fight him and be beaten.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Flower shared these views. There was little trouble in\r\ngetting our party to agree to the large reductions I proposed. The\r\nWilson-Gorman Tariff Bill was adopted. Meeting Senator Gorman later,\r\nhe explained that he had to give way on cotton ties to secure several\r\nSouthern Senators. Cotton ties had to be free. So tariff legislation\r\ngoes.\r\n\r\nI was not sufficiently prominent in manufacturing to take part in\r\ngetting the tariff established immediately after the war, so it\r\nhappened that my part has always been to favor reduction of duties,\r\nopposing extremes--the unreasonable protectionists who consider the\r\nhigher the duties the better and declaim against any reduction, and\r\nthe other extremists who denounce all duties and would adopt\r\nunrestrained free trade.\r\n\r\nWe could now (1907) abolish all duties upon steel and iron without\r\ninjury, essential as these duties were at the beginning. Europe has\r\nnot much surplus production, so that should prices rise exorbitantly\r\nhere only a small amount could be drawn from there and this would\r\ninstantly raise prices in Europe, so that our home manufacturers could\r\nnot be seriously affected. Free trade would only tend to prevent\r\nexorbitant prices here for a time when the demand was excessive. Home\r\niron and steel manufacturers have nothing to fear from free trade. [I\r\nrecently (1910) stated this in evidence before the Tariff Commission\r\nat Washington.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nNEW YORK AS HEADQUARTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nOur business continued to expand and required frequent visits on my\r\npart to the East, especially to New York, which is as London to\r\nBritain--the headquarters of all really important enterprises in\r\nAmerica. No large concern could very well get on without being\r\nrepresented there. My brother and Mr. Phipps had full grasp of the\r\nbusiness at Pittsburgh. My field appeared to be to direct the general\r\npolicy of the companies and negotiate the important contracts.\r\n\r\nMy brother had been so fortunate as to marry Miss Lucy Coleman,\r\ndaughter of one of our most valued partners and friends. Our family\r\nresidence at Homewood was given over to him, and I was once more\r\ncompelled to break old associations and leave Pittsburgh in 1867 to\r\ntake up my residence in New York. The change was hard enough for me,\r\nbut much harder for my mother; but she was still in the prime of life\r\nand we could be happy anywhere so long as we were together. Still she\r\ndid feel the leaving of our home very much. We were perfect strangers\r\nin New York, and at first took up our quarters in the St. Nicholas\r\nHotel, then in its glory. I opened an office in Broad Street.\r\n\r\nFor some time the Pittsburgh friends who came to New York were our\r\nchief source of happiness, and the Pittsburgh papers seemed necessary\r\nto our existence. I made frequent visits there and my mother often\r\naccompanied me, so that our connection with the old home was still\r\nmaintained. But after a time new friendships were formed and new\r\ninterests awakened and New York began to be called home. When the\r\nproprietors of the St. Nicholas opened the Windsor Hotel uptown, we\r\ntook up our residence there and up to the year 1887 that was our New\r\nYork home. Mr. Hawk, the proprietor, became one of our valued friends\r\nand his nephew and namesake still remains so.\r\n\r\nAmong the educative influences from which I derived great advantage in\r\nNew York, none ranks higher than the Nineteenth Century Club organized\r\nby Mr. and Mrs. Courtlandt Palmer. The club met at their house once a\r\nmonth for the discussion of various topics and soon attracted many\r\nable men and women. It was to Madame Botta I owed my election to\r\nmembership--a remarkable woman, wife of Professor Botta, whose\r\ndrawing-room became more of a salon than any in the city, if indeed it\r\nwere not the only one resembling a salon at that time. I was honored\r\nby an invitation one day to dine at the Bottas' and there met for the\r\nfirst time several distinguished people, among them one who became my\r\nlifelong friend and wise counselor, Andrew D. White, then president of\r\nCornell University, afterwards Ambassador to Russia and Germany, and\r\nour chief delegate to the Hague Conference.\r\n\r\nHere in the Nineteenth Century Club was an arena, indeed. Able men and\r\nwomen discussed the leading topics of the day in due form, addressing\r\nthe audience one after another. The gatherings soon became too large\r\nfor a private room. The monthly meetings were then held in the\r\nAmerican Art Galleries. I remember the first evening I took part as\r\none of the speakers the subject was \"The Aristocracy of the Dollar.\"\r\nColonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson was the first speaker. This was my\r\nintroduction to a New York audience. Thereafter I spoke now and then.\r\nIt was excellent training, for one had to read and study for each\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nI had lived long enough in Pittsburgh to acquire the manufacturing, as\r\ndistinguished from the speculative, spirit. My knowledge of affairs,\r\nderived from my position as telegraph operator, had enabled me to know\r\nthe few Pittsburgh men or firms which then had dealings upon the New\r\nYork Stock Exchange, and I watched their careers with deep interest.\r\nTo me their operations seemed simply a species of gambling. I did not\r\nthen know that the credit of all these men or firms was seriously\r\nimpaired by the knowledge (which it is almost impossible to conceal)\r\nthat they were given to speculation. But the firms were then so few\r\nthat I could have counted them on the fingers of one hand. The Oil and\r\nStock Exchanges in Pittsburgh had not as yet been founded and brokers'\r\noffices with wires in connection with the stock exchanges of the East\r\nwere unnecessary. Pittsburgh was emphatically a manufacturing town.\r\n\r\nI was surprised to find how very different was the state of affairs in\r\nNew York. There were few even of the business men who had not their\r\nventures in Wall Street to a greater or less extent. I was besieged\r\nwith inquiries from all quarters in regard to the various railway\r\nenterprises with which I was connected. Offers were made to me by\r\npersons who were willing to furnish capital for investment and allow\r\nme to manage it--the supposition being that from the inside view which\r\nI was enabled to obtain I could invest for them successfully.\r\nInvitations were extended to me to join parties who intended quietly\r\nto buy up the control of certain properties. In fact the whole\r\nspeculative field was laid out before me in its most seductive guise.\r\n\r\nAll these allurements I declined. The most notable offer of this kind\r\nI ever received was one morning in the Windsor Hotel soon after my\r\nremoval to New York. Jay Gould, then in the height of his career,\r\napproached me and said he had heard of me and he would purchase\r\ncontrol of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company and give me one half of\r\nall profits if I would agree to devote myself to its management. I\r\nthanked him and said that, although Mr. Scott and I had parted company\r\nin business matters, I would never raise my hand against him.\r\nSubsequently Mr. Scott told me he had heard I had been selected by New\r\nYork interests to succeed him. I do not know how he had learned this,\r\nas I had never mentioned it. I was able to reassure him by saying that\r\nthe only railroad company I would be president of would be one I\r\nowned.\r\n\r\nStrange what changes the whirligig of time brings in. It was my part\r\none morning in 1900, some thirty years afterwards, to tell the son of\r\nMr. Gould of his father's offer and to say to him:\r\n\r\n\"Your father offered me control of the great Pennsylvania system. Now\r\nI offer his son in return the control of an international line from\r\nocean to ocean.\"\r\n\r\nThe son and I agreed upon the first step--that was the bringing of his\r\nWabash line to Pittsburgh. This was successfully done under a contract\r\ngiven the Wabash of one third of the traffic of our steel company. We\r\nwere about to take up the eastern extension from Pittsburgh to the\r\nAtlantic when Mr. Morgan approached me in March, 1901, through Mr.\r\nSchwab, and asked if I really wished to retire from business. I\r\nanswered in the affirmative and that put an end to our railway\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nI have never bought or sold a share of stock speculatively in my life,\r\nexcept one small lot of Pennsylvania Railroad shares that I bought\r\nearly in life for investment and for which I did not pay at the time\r\nbecause bankers offered to carry it for me at a low rate. I have\r\nadhered to the rule never to purchase what I did not pay for, and\r\nnever to sell what I did not own. In those early days, however, I had\r\nseveral interests that were taken over in the course of business. They\r\nincluded some stocks and securities that were quoted on the New York\r\nStock Exchange, and I found that when I opened my paper in the morning\r\nI was tempted to look first at the quotations of the stock market. As\r\nI had determined to sell all my interests in every outside concern and\r\nconcentrate my attention upon our manufacturing concerns in\r\nPittsburgh, I further resolved not even to own any stock that was\r\nbought and sold upon any stock exchange. With the exception of\r\ntrifling amounts which came to me in various ways I have adhered\r\nstrictly to this rule.\r\n\r\nSuch a course should commend itself to every man in the manufacturing\r\nbusiness and to all professional men. For the manufacturing man\r\nespecially the rule would seem all-important. His mind must be kept\r\ncalm and free if he is to decide wisely the problems which are\r\ncontinually coming before him. Nothing tells in the long run like good\r\njudgment, and no sound judgment can remain with the man whose mind is\r\ndisturbed by the mercurial changes of the Stock Exchange. It places\r\nhim under an influence akin to intoxication. What is not, he sees, and\r\nwhat he sees, is not. He cannot judge of relative values or get the\r\ntrue perspective of things. The molehill seems to him a mountain and\r\nthe mountain a molehill, and he jumps at conclusions which he should\r\narrive at by reason. His mind is upon the stock quotations and not\r\nupon the points that require calm thought. Speculation is a parasite\r\nfeeding upon values, creating none.\r\n\r\nMy first important enterprise after settling in New York was\r\nundertaking to build a bridge across the Mississippi at Keokuk.[29]\r\nMr. Thomson, president of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and I contracted\r\nfor the whole structure, foundation, masonry, and superstructure,\r\ntaking bonds and stocks in payment. The undertaking was a splendid\r\nsuccess in every respect, except financially. A panic threw the\r\nconnecting railways into bankruptcy. They were unable to pay the\r\nstipulated sums. Rival systems built a bridge across the Mississippi\r\nat Burlington and a railway down the west side of the Mississippi to\r\nKeokuk. The handsome profits which we saw in prospect were never\r\nrealized. Mr. Thomson and myself, however, escaped loss, although\r\nthere was little margin left.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: It was an iron bridge 2300 feet in length with a\r\n380-foot span.]\r\n\r\nThe superstructure for this bridge was built at our Keystone Works in\r\nPittsburgh. The undertaking required me to visit Keokuk occasionally,\r\nand there I made the acquaintance of clever and delightful people,\r\namong them General and Mrs. Reid, and Mr. and Mrs. Leighton. Visiting\r\nKeokuk with some English friends at a later date, the impression they\r\nreceived of society in the Far West, on what to them seemed the very\r\noutskirts of civilization, was surprising. A reception given to us one\r\nevening by General Reid brought together an assembly creditable to any\r\ntown in Britain. More than one of the guests had distinguished himself\r\nduring the war and had risen to prominence in the national councils.\r\n\r\nThe reputation obtained in the building of the Keokuk bridge led to my\r\nbeing applied to by those who were in charge of the scheme for\r\nbridging the Mississippi at St. Louis, to which I have already\r\nreferred. This was connected with my first large financial\r\ntransaction. One day in 1869 the gentleman in charge of the\r\nenterprise, Mr. Macpherson (he was very Scotch), called at my New York\r\noffice and said they were trying to raise capital to build the bridge.\r\nHe wished to know if I could not enlist some of the Eastern railroad\r\ncompanies in the scheme. After careful examination of the project I\r\nmade the contract for the construction of the bridge on behalf of the\r\nKeystone Bridge Works. I also obtained an option upon four million\r\ndollars of first mortgage bonds of the bridge company and set out for\r\nLondon in March, 1869, to negotiate their sale.\r\n\r\nDuring the voyage I prepared a prospectus which I had printed upon my\r\narrival in London, and, having upon my previous visit made the\r\nacquaintance of Junius S. Morgan, the great banker, I called upon him\r\none morning and opened negotiations. I left with him a copy of the\r\nprospectus, and upon calling next day was delighted to find that Mr.\r\nMorgan viewed the matter favorably. I sold him part of the bonds with\r\nthe option to take the remainder; but when his lawyers were called in\r\nfor advice a score of changes were required in the wording of the\r\nbonds. Mr. Morgan said to me that as I was going to Scotland I had\r\nbetter go now; I could write the parties in St. Louis and ascertain\r\nwhether they would agree to the changes proposed. It would be time\r\nenough, he said, to close the matter upon my return three weeks hence.\r\n\r\nBut I had no idea of allowing the fish to play so long, and informed\r\nhim that I would have a telegram in the morning agreeing to all the\r\nchanges. The Atlantic cable had been open for some time, but it is\r\ndoubtful if it had yet carried so long a private cable as I sent that\r\nday. It was an easy matter to number the lines of the bond and then\r\ngoing carefully over them to state what changes, omissions, or\r\nadditions were required in each line. I showed Mr. Morgan the message\r\nbefore sending it and he said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, young man, if you succeed in that you deserve a red mark.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I entered the office next morning, I found on the desk that had\r\nbeen appropriated to my use in Mr. Morgan's private office the colored\r\nenvelope which contained the answer. There it was: \"Board meeting last\r\nnight; changes all approved.\" \"Now, Mr. Morgan,\" I said, \"we can\r\nproceed, assuming that the bond is as your lawyers desire.\" The papers\r\nwere soon closed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUNIUS SPENCER MORGAN]\r\n\r\nWhile I was in the office Mr. Sampson, the financial editor of \"The\r\nTimes,\" came in. I had an interview with him, well knowing that a few\r\nwords from him would go far in lifting the price of the bonds on the\r\nExchange. American securities had recently been fiercely attacked,\r\nowing to the proceedings of Fisk and Gould in connection with the Erie\r\nRailway Company, and their control of the judges in New York, who\r\nseemed to do their bidding. I knew this would be handed out as an\r\nobjection, and therefore I met it at once. I called Mr. Sampson's\r\nattention to the fact that the charter of the St. Louis Bridge Company\r\nwas from the National Government. In case of necessity appeal lay\r\ndirectly to the Supreme Court of the United States, a body vying with\r\ntheir own high tribunals. He said he would be delighted to give\r\nprominence to this commendable feature. I described the bridge as a\r\ntoll-gate on the continental highway and this appeared to please him.\r\nIt was all plain and easy sailing, and when he left the office, Mr.\r\nMorgan clapped me on the shoulder and said:\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, young man; you have raised the price of those bonds five\r\nper cent this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Mr. Morgan,\" I replied; \"now show me how I can raise them\r\nfive per cent more for you.\"\r\n\r\nThe issue was a great success, and the money for the St. Louis Bridge\r\nwas obtained. I had a considerable margin of profit upon the\r\nnegotiation. This was my first financial negotiation with the bankers\r\nof Europe. Mr. Pullman told me a few days later that Mr. Morgan at a\r\ndinner party had told the telegraphic incident and predicted, \"That\r\nyoung man will be heard from.\"\r\n\r\nAfter closing with Mr. Morgan, I visited my native town, Dunfermline,\r\nand at that time made the town a gift of public baths. It is notable\r\nlargely because it was the first considerable gift I had ever made.\r\nLong before that I had, at my Uncle Lauder's suggestion, sent a\r\nsubscription to the fund for the Wallace Monument on Stirling Heights\r\noverlooking Bannockburn. It was not much, but I was then in the\r\ntelegraph office and it was considerable out of a revenue of thirty\r\ndollars per month with family expenses staring us in the face. Mother\r\ndid not grudge it; on the contrary, she was a very proud woman that\r\nher son's name was seen on the list of contributors, and her son felt\r\nhe was really beginning to be something of a man. Years afterward my\r\nmother and I visited Stirling, and there unveiled, in the Wallace\r\nTower, a bust of Sir Walter Scott, which she had presented to the\r\nmonument committee. We had then made great progress, at least\r\nfinancially, since the early subscription. But distribution had not\r\nyet begun.[30] So far with me it had been the age of accumulation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: The ambitions of Mr. Carnegie at this time (1868) are\r\nset forth in the following memorandum made by him. It has only\r\nrecently come to light:\r\n\r\n_St. Nicholas Hotel, New York, December, 1868_\r\n\r\nThirty-three and an income of $50,000 per annum! By this time two\r\nyears I can so arrange all my business as to secure at least $50,000\r\nper annum. Beyond this never earn--make no effort to increase fortune,\r\nbut spend the surplus each year for benevolent purposes. Cast aside\r\nbusiness forever, except for others.\r\n\r\nSettle in Oxford and get a thorough education, making the acquaintance\r\nof literary men--this will take three years' active work--pay especial\r\nattention to speaking in public. Settle then in London and purchase a\r\ncontrolling interest in some newspaper or live review and give the\r\ngeneral management of it attention, taking a part in public matters,\r\nespecially those connected with education and improvement of the\r\npoorer classes.\r\n\r\nMan must have an idol--the amassing of wealth is one of the worst\r\nspecies of idolatry--no idol more debasing than the worship of money.\r\nWhatever I engage in I must push inordinately; therefore should I be\r\ncareful to choose that life which will be the most elevating in its\r\ncharacter. To continue much longer overwhelmed by business cares and\r\nwith most of my thoughts wholly upon the way to make more money in the\r\nshortest time, must degrade me beyond hope of permanent recovery. I\r\nwill resign business at thirty-five, but during the ensuing two years\r\nI wish to spend the afternoons in receiving instruction and in reading\r\nsystematically.]\r\n\r\nWhile visiting the Continent of Europe in 1867 and deeply interested\r\nin what I saw, it must not be thought that my mind was not upon\r\naffairs at home. Frequent letters kept me advised of business matters.\r\nThe question of railway communication with the Pacific had been\r\nbrought to the front by the Civil War, and Congress had passed an act\r\nto encourage the construction of a line. The first sod had just been\r\ncut at Omaha and it was intended that the line should ultimately be\r\npushed through to San Francisco. One day while in Rome it struck me\r\nthat this might be done much sooner than was then anticipated. The\r\nnation, having made up its mind that its territory must be bound\r\ntogether, might be trusted to see that no time was lost in\r\naccomplishing it. I wrote my friend Mr. Scott, suggesting that we\r\nshould obtain the contract to place sleeping-cars upon the great\r\nCalifornia line. His reply contained these words:\r\n\r\n\"Well, young man, you do take time by the forelock.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, upon my return to America. I pursued the idea. The\r\nsleeping-car business, in which I was interested, had gone on\r\nincreasing so rapidly that it was impossible to obtain cars enough to\r\nsupply the demand. This very fact led to the forming of the present\r\nPullman Company. The Central Transportation Company was simply unable\r\nto cover the territory with sufficient rapidity, and Mr. Pullman\r\nbeginning at the greatest of all railway centers in the\r\nworld--Chicago--soon rivaled the parent concern. He had also seen that\r\nthe Pacific Railroad would be the great sleeping-car line of the\r\nworld, and I found him working for what I had started after. He was,\r\nindeed, a lion in the path. Again, one may learn, from an incident\r\nwhich I had from Mr. Pullman himself, by what trifles important\r\nmatters are sometimes determined.\r\n\r\nThe president of the Union Pacific Railway was passing through\r\nChicago. Mr. Pullman called upon him and was shown into his room.\r\nLying upon the table was a telegram addressed to Mr. Scott, saying,\r\n\"Your proposition for sleeping-cars is accepted.\" Mr. Pullman read\r\nthis involuntarily and before he had time to refrain. He could not\r\nhelp seeing it where it lay. When President Durrant entered the room\r\nhe explained this to him and said:\r\n\r\n\"I trust you will not decide this matter until I have made a\r\nproposition to you.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Durrant promised to wait. A meeting of the board of directors of\r\nthe Union Pacific Company was held soon after this in New York. Mr.\r\nPullman and myself were in attendance, both striving to obtain the\r\nprize which neither he nor I undervalued. One evening we began to\r\nmount the broad staircase in the St. Nicholas Hotel at the same time.\r\nWe had met before, but were not well acquainted. I said, however, as\r\nwe walked up the stairs:\r\n\r\n\"Good-evening, Mr. Pullman! Here we are together, and are we not\r\nmaking a nice couple of fools of ourselves?\" He was not disposed to\r\nadmit anything and said:\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\nI explained the situation to him. We were destroying by our rival\r\npropositions the very advantages we desired to obtain.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, \"what do you propose to do about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Unite,\" I said. \"Make a joint proposition to the Union Pacific, your\r\nparty and mine, and organize a company.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you call it?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"The Pullman Palace Car Company,\" I replied.\r\n\r\nThis suited him exactly; and it suited me equally well.\r\n\r\n\"Come into my room and talk it over,\" said the great sleeping-car man.\r\n\r\nI did so, and the result was that we obtained the contract jointly.\r\nOur company was subsequently merged in the general Pullman Company and\r\nwe took stock in that company for our Pacific interests. Until\r\ncompelled to sell my shares during the subsequent financial panic of\r\n1873 to protect our iron and steel interests, I was, I believe, the\r\nlargest shareholder in the Pullman Company.\r\n\r\nThis man Pullman and his career are so thoroughly American that a few\r\nwords about him will not be out of place. Mr. Pullman was at first a\r\nworking carpenter, but when Chicago had to be elevated he took a\r\ncontract on his own account to move or elevate houses for a\r\nstipulated sum. Of course he was successful, and from this small\r\nbeginning he became one of the principal and best-known contractors in\r\nthat line. If a great hotel was to be raised ten feet without\r\ndisturbing its hundreds of guests or interfering in any way with its\r\nbusiness, Mr. Pullman was the man. He was one of those rare characters\r\nwho can see the drift of things, and was always to be found, so to\r\nspeak, swimming in the main current where movement was the fastest. He\r\nsoon saw, as I did, that the sleeping-car was a positive necessity\r\nupon the American continent. He began to construct a few cars at\r\nChicago and to obtain contracts upon the lines centering there.\r\n\r\nThe Eastern concern was in no condition to cope with that of an\r\nextraordinary man like Mr. Pullman. I soon recognized this, and\r\nalthough the original patents were with the Eastern company and Mr.\r\nWoodruff himself, the original patentee, was a large shareholder, and\r\nalthough we might have obtained damages for infringement of patent\r\nafter some years of litigation, yet the time lost before this could be\r\ndone would have been sufficient to make Pullman's the great company of\r\nthe country. I therefore earnestly advocated that we should unite with\r\nMr. Pullman, as I had united with him before in the Union Pacific\r\ncontract. As the personal relations between Mr. Pullman and some\r\nmembers of the Eastern company were unsatisfactory, it was deemed best\r\nthat I should undertake the negotiations, being upon friendly footing\r\nwith both parties. We soon agreed that the Pullman Company should\r\nabsorb our company, the Central Transportation Company, and by this\r\nmeans Mr. Pullman, instead of being confined to the West, obtained\r\ncontrol of the rights on the great Pennsylvania trunk line to the\r\nAtlantic seaboard. This placed his company beyond all possible rivals.\r\nMr. Pullman was one of the ablest men of affairs I have ever known,\r\nand I am indebted to him, among other things, for one story which\r\ncarried a moral.\r\n\r\nMr. Pullman, like every other man, had his difficulties and\r\ndisappointments, and did not hit the mark every time. No one does.\r\nIndeed, I do not know any one but himself who could have surmounted\r\nthe difficulties surrounding the business of running sleeping-cars in\r\na satisfactory manner and still retained some rights which the railway\r\ncompanies were bound to respect. Railway companies should, of course,\r\noperate their own sleeping-cars. On one occasion when we were\r\ncomparing notes he told me that he always found comfort in this story.\r\nAn old man in a Western county having suffered from all the ills that\r\nflesh is heir to, and a great many more than it usually encounters,\r\nand being commiserated by his neighbors, replied:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my friends, all that you say is true. I have had a long, long\r\nlife full of troubles, but there is one curious fact about them--nine\r\ntenths of them never happened.\"\r\n\r\nTrue indeed; most of the troubles of humanity are imaginary and should\r\nbe laughed out of court. It is folly to cross a bridge until you come\r\nto it, or to bid the Devil good-morning until you meet him--perfect\r\nfolly. All is well until the stroke falls, and even then nine times\r\nout of ten it is not so bad as anticipated. A wise man is the\r\nconfirmed optimist.\r\n\r\nSuccess in these various negotiations had brought me into some notice\r\nin New York, and my next large operation was in connection with the\r\nUnion Pacific Railway in 1871. One of its directors came to me saying\r\nthat they must raise in some way a sum of six hundred thousand dollars\r\n(equal to many millions to-day) to carry them through a crisis; and\r\nsome friends who knew me and were on the executive committee of that\r\nroad had suggested that I might be able to obtain the money and at the\r\nsame time get for the Pennsylvania Railroad Company virtual control of\r\nthat important Western line. I believe Mr. Pullman came with the\r\ndirector, or perhaps it was Mr. Pullman himself who first came to me\r\non the subject.\r\n\r\nI took up the matter, and it occurred to me that if the directors of\r\nthe Union Pacific Railway would be willing to elect to its board of\r\ndirectors a few such men as the Pennsylvania Railroad would nominate,\r\nthe traffic to be thus obtained for the Pennsylvania would justify\r\nthat company in helping the Union Pacific. I went to Philadelphia and\r\nlaid the subject before President Thomson. I suggested that if the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad Company would trust me with securities upon\r\nwhich the Union Pacific could borrow money in New York, we could\r\ncontrol the Union Pacific in the interests of the Pennsylvania. Among\r\nmany marks of Mr. Thomson's confidence this was up to that time the\r\ngreatest. He was much more conservative when handling the money of the\r\nrailroad company than his own, but the prize offered was too great to\r\nbe missed. Even if the six hundred thousand dollars had been lost, it\r\nwould not have been a losing investment for his company, and there was\r\nlittle danger of this because we were ready to hand over to him the\r\nsecurities which we obtained in return for the loan to the Union\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nMy interview with Mr. Thomson took place at his house in Philadelphia,\r\nand as I rose to go he laid his hand upon my shoulder, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Remember, Andy, I look to you in this matter. It is you I trust, and\r\nI depend on your holding all the securities you obtain and seeing\r\nthat the Pennsylvania Railroad is never in a position where it can\r\nlose a dollar.\"\r\n\r\nI accepted the responsibility, and the result was a triumphant\r\nsuccess. The Union Pacific Company was exceedingly anxious that Mr.\r\nThomson himself should take the presidency, but this he said was out\r\nof the question. He nominated Mr. Thomas A. Scott, vice-president of\r\nthe Pennsylvania Railroad, for the position. Mr. Scott, Mr. Pullman,\r\nand myself were accordingly elected directors of the Union Pacific\r\nRailway Company in 1871.\r\n\r\nThe securities obtained for the loan consisted of three millions of\r\nthe shares of the Union Pacific, which were locked in my safe, with\r\nthe option of taking them at a price. As was to be expected, the\r\naccession of the Pennsylvania Railroad party rendered the stock of the\r\nUnion Pacific infinitely more valuable. The shares advanced\r\nenormously. At this time I undertook to negotiate bonds in London for\r\na bridge to cross the Missouri at Omaha, and while I was absent upon\r\nthis business Mr. Scott decided to sell our Union Pacific shares. I\r\nhad left instructions with my secretary that Mr. Scott, as one of the\r\npartners in the venture, should have access to the vault, as it might\r\nbe necessary in my absence that the securities should be within reach\r\nof some one; but the idea that these should be sold, or that our party\r\nshould lose the splendid position we had acquired in connection with\r\nthe Union Pacific, never entered my brain.\r\n\r\nI returned to find that, instead of being a trusted colleague of the\r\nUnion Pacific directors, I was regarded as having used them for\r\nspeculative purposes. No quartet of men ever had a finer opportunity\r\nfor identifying themselves with a great work than we had; and never\r\nwas an opportunity more recklessly thrown away. Mr. Pullman was\r\nignorant of the matter and as indignant as myself, and I believe that\r\nhe at once re-invested his profits in the shares of the Union Pacific.\r\nI felt that much as I wished to do this and to repudiate what had been\r\ndone, it would be unbecoming and perhaps ungrateful in me to separate\r\nmyself so distinctly from my first of friends, Mr. Scott.\r\n\r\nAt the first opportunity we were ignominiously but deservedly expelled\r\nfrom the Union Pacific board. It was a bitter dose for a young man to\r\nswallow. And the transaction marked my first serious difference with a\r\nman who up to that time had the greatest influence with me, the kind\r\nand affectionate employer of my boyhood, Thomas A. Scott. Mr. Thomson\r\nregretted the matter, but, as he said, having paid no attention to it\r\nand having left the whole control of it in the hands of Mr. Scott and\r\nmyself, he presumed that I had thought best to sell out. For a time I\r\nfeared I had lost a valued friend in Levi P. Morton, of Morton, Bliss\r\n& Co., who was interested in Union Pacific, but at last he found out\r\nthat I was innocent.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations concerning two and a half millions of bonds for the\r\nconstruction of the Omaha Bridge were successful, and as these bonds\r\nhad been purchased by persons connected with the Union Pacific before\r\nI had anything to do with the company, it was for them and not for the\r\nUnion Pacific Company that the negotiations were conducted. This was\r\nnot explained to me by the director who talked with me before I left\r\nfor London. Unfortunately, when I returned to New York I found that\r\nthe entire proceeds of the bonds, including my profit, had been\r\nappropriated by the parties to pay their own debts, and I was thus\r\nbeaten out of a handsome sum, and had to credit to profit and loss my\r\nexpenses and time. I had never before been cheated and found it out so\r\npositively and so clearly. I saw that I was still young and had a good\r\ndeal to learn. Many men can be trusted, but a few need watching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nBUSINESS NEGOTIATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nComplete success attended a negotiation which I conducted about this\r\ntime for Colonel William Phillips, president of the Allegheny Valley\r\nRailway at Pittsburgh. One day the Colonel entered my New York office\r\nand told me that he needed money badly, but that he could get no house\r\nin America to entertain the idea of purchasing five millions of bonds\r\nof his company although they were to be guaranteed by the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad Company. The old gentleman felt sure that he was being driven\r\nfrom pillar to post by the bankers because they had agreed among\r\nthemselves to purchase the bonds only upon their own terms. He asked\r\nninety cents on the dollar for them, but this the bankers considered\r\npreposterously high. Those were the days when Western railway bonds\r\nwere often sold to the bankers at eighty cents on the dollar.\r\n\r\nColonel Phillips said he had come to see whether I could not suggest\r\nsome way out of his difficulty. He had pressing need for two hundred\r\nand fifty thousand dollars, and this Mr. Thomson, of the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad, could not give him. The Allegheny bonds were seven per\r\ncents, but they were payable, not in gold, but in currency, in\r\nAmerica. They were therefore wholly unsuited for the foreign market.\r\nBut I knew that the Pennsylvania Railroad Company had a large amount\r\nof Philadelphia and Erie Railroad six per cent gold bonds in its\r\ntreasury. It would be a most desirable exchange on its part, I\r\nthought, to give these bonds for the seven per cent Allegheny bonds\r\nwhich bore its guarantee.\r\n\r\nI telegraphed Mr. Thomson, asking if the Pennsylvania Railroad Company\r\nwould take two hundred and fifty thousand dollars at interest and lend\r\nit to the Allegheny Railway Company. Mr. Thomson replied, \"Certainly.\"\r\nColonel Phillips was happy. He agreed, in consideration of my\r\nservices, to give me a sixty-days option to take his five millions of\r\nbonds at the desired ninety cents on the dollar. I laid the matter\r\nbefore Mr. Thomson and suggested an exchange, which that company was\r\nonly too glad to make, as it saved one per cent interest on the bonds.\r\nI sailed at once for London with the control of five millions of first\r\nmortgage Philadelphia and Erie Bonds, guaranteed by the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad Company--a magnificent security for which I wanted a high\r\nprice. And here comes in one of the greatest of the hits and misses of\r\nmy financial life.\r\n\r\nI wrote the Barings from Queenstown that I had for sale a security\r\nwhich even their house might unhesitatingly consider. On my arrival in\r\nLondon I found at the hotel a note from them requesting me to call. I\r\ndid so the next morning, and before I had left their banking house I\r\nhad closed an agreement by which they were to bring out this loan, and\r\nthat until they sold the bonds at par, less their two and a half per\r\ncent commission, they would advance the Pennsylvania Railroad Company\r\nfour millions of dollars at five per cent interest. The sale left me a\r\nclear profit of more than half a million dollars.\r\n\r\nThe papers were ordered to be drawn up, but as I was leaving Mr.\r\nRussell Sturgis said they had just heard that Mr. Baring himself was\r\ncoming up to town in the morning. They had arranged to hold a\r\n\"court,\" and as it would be fitting to lay the transaction before him\r\nas a matter of courtesy they would postpone the signing of the papers\r\nuntil the morrow. If I would call at two o'clock the transaction would\r\nbe closed.\r\n\r\nNever shall I forget the oppressed feeling which overcame me as I\r\nstepped out and proceeded to the telegraph office to wire President\r\nThomson. Something told me that I ought not to do so. I would wait\r\ntill to-morrow when I had the contract in my pocket. I walked from the\r\nbanking house to the Langham Hotel--four long miles. When I reached\r\nthere I found a messenger waiting breathless to hand me a sealed note\r\nfrom the Barings. Bismarck had locked up a hundred millions in\r\nMagdeburg. The financial world was panic-stricken, and the Barings\r\nbegged to say that under the circumstances they could not propose to\r\nMr. Baring to go on with the matter. There was as much chance that I\r\nshould be struck by lightning on my way home as that an arrangement\r\nagreed to by the Barings should be broken. And yet it was. It was too\r\ngreat a blow to produce anything like irritation or indignation. I was\r\nmeek enough to be quite resigned, and merely congratulated myself that\r\nI had not telegraphed Mr. Thomson.\r\n\r\nI decided not to return to the Barings, and although J.S. Morgan & Co.\r\nhad been bringing out a great many American securities I subsequently\r\nsold the bonds to them at a reduced price as compared with that agreed\r\nto by the Barings. I thought it best not to go to Morgan & Co. at\r\nfirst, because I had understood from Colonel Phillips that the bonds\r\nhad been unsuccessfully offered by him to their house in America and I\r\nsupposed that the Morgans in London might consider themselves\r\nconnected with the negotiations through their house in New York. But\r\nin all subsequent negotiations I made it a rule to give the first\r\noffer to Junius S. Morgan, who seldom permitted me to leave his\r\nbanking house without taking what I had to offer. If he could not buy\r\nfor his own house, he placed me in communication with a friendly house\r\nthat did, he taking an interest in the issue. It is a great\r\nsatisfaction to reflect that I never negotiated a security which did\r\nnot to the end command a premium. Of course in this case I made a\r\nmistake in not returning to the Barings, giving them time and letting\r\nthe panic subside, which it soon did. When one party to a bargain\r\nbecomes excited, the other should keep cool and patient.\r\n\r\nAs an incident of my financial operations I remember saying to Mr.\r\nMorgan one day:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Morgan, I will give you an idea and help you to carry it forward\r\nif you will give me one quarter of all the money you make by acting\r\nupon it.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughingly said: \"That seems fair, and as I have the option to act\r\nupon it, or not, certainly we ought to be willing to pay you a quarter\r\nof the profit.\"\r\n\r\nI called attention to the fact that the Allegheny Valley Railway bonds\r\nwhich I had exchanged for the Philadelphia and Erie bonds bore the\r\nguarantee of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and that that great\r\ncompany was always in need of money for essential extensions. A price\r\nmight be offered for these bonds which might tempt the company to sell\r\nthem, and that at the moment there appeared to be such a demand for\r\nAmerican securities that no doubt they could be floated. I would write\r\na prospectus which I thought would float the bonds. After examining\r\nthe matter with his usual care he decided that he would act upon my\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomson was then in Paris and I ran over there to see him. Knowing\r\nthat the Pennsylvania Railroad had need for money I told him that I\r\nhad recommended these securities to Mr. Morgan and if he would give me\r\na price for them I would see if I could not sell them. He named a\r\nprice which was then very high, but less than the price which these\r\nbonds have since reached. Mr. Morgan purchased part of them with the\r\nright to buy others, and in this way the whole nine or ten millions of\r\nAllegheny bonds were marketed and the Pennsylvania Railroad Company\r\nplaced in funds.\r\n\r\nThe sale of the bonds had not gone very far when the panic of 1873 was\r\nupon us. One of the sources of revenue which I then had was Mr.\r\nPierpont Morgan. He said to me one day:\r\n\r\n\"My father has cabled to ask whether you wish to sell out your\r\ninterest in that idea you gave him.\"\r\n\r\nI said: \"Yes, I do. In these days I will sell anything for money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, \"what would you take?\"\r\n\r\nI said I believed that a statement recently rendered to me showed that\r\nthere were already fifty thousand dollars to my credit, and I would\r\ntake sixty thousand. Next morning when I called Mr. Morgan handed me\r\nchecks for seventy thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Carnegie,\" he said, \"you were mistaken. You sold out for ten\r\nthousand dollars less than the statement showed to your credit. It now\r\nshows not fifty but sixty thousand to your credit, and the additional\r\nten makes seventy.\"\r\n\r\nThe payments were in two checks, one for sixty thousand dollars and\r\nthe other for the additional ten thousand. I handed him back the\r\nten-thousand-dollar check, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is something worthy of you. Will you please accept these\r\nten thousand with my best wishes?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you,\" he said, \"I cannot do that.\"\r\n\r\nSuch acts, showing a nice sense of honorable understanding as against\r\nmere legal rights, are not so uncommon in business as the uninitiated\r\nmight believe. And, after that, it is not to be wondered at if I\r\ndetermined that so far as lay in my power neither Morgan, father or\r\nson, nor their house, should suffer through me. They had in me\r\nhenceforth a firm friend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN PIERPONT MORGAN]\r\n\r\nA great business is seldom if ever built up, except on lines of the\r\nstrictest integrity. A reputation for \"cuteness\" and sharp dealing is\r\nfatal in great affairs. Not the letter of the law, but the spirit,\r\nmust be the rule. The standard of commercial morality is now very\r\nhigh. A mistake made by any one in favor of the firm is corrected as\r\npromptly as if the error were in favor of the other party. It is\r\nessential to permanent success that a house should obtain a reputation\r\nfor being governed by what is fair rather than what is merely legal. A\r\nrule which we adopted and adhered to has given greater returns than\r\none would believe possible, namely: always give the other party the\r\nbenefit of the doubt. This, of course, does not apply to the\r\nspeculative class. An entirely different atmosphere pervades that\r\nworld. Men are only gamblers there. Stock gambling and honorable\r\nbusiness are incompatible. In recent years it must be admitted that\r\nthe old-fashioned \"banker,\" like Junius S. Morgan of London, has\r\nbecome rare.\r\n\r\nSoon after being deposed as president of the Union Pacific, Mr.\r\nScott[31] resolved upon the construction of the Texas Pacific\r\nRailway. He telegraphed me one day in New York to meet him at\r\nPhiladelphia without fail. I met him there with several other friends,\r\namong them Mr. J.N. McCullough, vice-president of the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad Company at Pittsburgh. A large loan for the Texas Pacific had\r\nfallen due in London and its renewal was agreed to by Morgan & Co.,\r\nprovided I would join the other parties to the loan. I declined. I was\r\nthen asked whether I would bring them all to ruin by refusing to stand\r\nby my friends. It was one of the most trying moments of my whole life.\r\nYet I was not tempted for a moment to entertain the idea of involving\r\nmyself. The question of what was my duty came first and prevented\r\nthat. All my capital was in manufacturing and every dollar of it was\r\nrequired. I was the capitalist (then a modest one, indeed) of our\r\nconcern. All depended upon me. My brother with his wife and family,\r\nMr. Phipps and his family, Mr. Kloman and his family, all rose up\r\nbefore me and claimed protection.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Colonel Thomas A. Scott left the Union Pacific in 1872.\r\nThe same year he became president of the Texas Pacific, and in 1874\r\npresident of the Pennsylvania.]\r\n\r\nI told Mr. Scott that I had done my best to prevent him from beginning\r\nto construct a great railway before he had secured the necessary\r\ncapital. I had insisted that thousands of miles of railway lines could\r\nnot be constructed by means of temporary loans. Besides, I had paid\r\ntwo hundred and fifty thousand dollars cash for an interest in it,\r\nwhich he told me upon my return from Europe he had reserved for me,\r\nalthough I had never approved the scheme. But nothing in the world\r\nwould ever induce me to be guilty of endorsing the paper of that\r\nconstruction company or of any other concern than our own firm.\r\n\r\nI knew that it would be impossible for me to pay the Morgan loan in\r\nsixty days, or even to pay my proportion of it. Besides, it was not\r\nthat loan by itself, but the half-dozen other loans that would be\r\nrequired thereafter that had to be considered. This marked another\r\nstep in the total business separation which had to come between Mr.\r\nScott and myself. It gave more pain than all the financial trials to\r\nwhich I had been subjected up to that time.\r\n\r\nIt was not long after this meeting that the disaster came and the\r\ncountry was startled by the failure of those whom it had regarded as\r\nits strongest men. I fear Mr. Scott's premature death[32] can\r\nmeasurably be attributed to the humiliation which he had to bear. He\r\nwas a sensitive rather than a proud man, and his seemingly impending\r\nfailure cut him to the quick. Mr. McManus and Mr. Baird, partners in\r\nthe enterprise, also soon passed away. These two men were\r\nmanufacturers like myself and in no position to engage in railway\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Died May 21, 1881.]\r\n\r\nThe business man has no rock more dangerous to encounter in his career\r\nthan this very one of endorsing commercial paper. It can easily be\r\navoided if he asks himself two questions: Have I surplus means for all\r\npossible requirements which will enable me to pay without\r\ninconvenience the utmost sum for which I am liable under this\r\nendorsement? Secondly: Am I willing to lose this sum for the friend\r\nfor whom I endorse? If these two questions can be answered in the\r\naffirmative he may be permitted to oblige his friend, but not\r\notherwise, if he be a wise man. And if he can answer the first\r\nquestion in the affirmative it will be well for him to consider\r\nwhether it would not be better then and there to pay the entire sum\r\nfor which his name is asked. I am sure it would be. A man's means are\r\na trust to be sacredly held for his own creditors as long as he has\r\ndebts and obligations.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my refusal to endorse the Morgan renewal, I was\r\ninvited to accompany the parties to New York next morning in their\r\nspecial car for the purpose of consultation. This I was only too glad\r\nto do. Anthony Drexel was also called in to accompany us. During the\r\njourney Mr. McCullough remarked that he had been looking around the\r\ncar and had made up his mind that there was only one sensible man in\r\nit; the rest had all been \"fools.\" Here was \"Andy\" who had paid for\r\nhis shares and did not owe a dollar or have any responsibility in the\r\nmatter, and that was the position they all ought to have been in.\r\n\r\nMr. Drexel said he would like me to explain how I had been able to\r\nsteer clear of these unfortunate troubles. I answered: by strict\r\nadherence to what I believed to be my duty never to put my name to\r\nanything which I knew I could not pay at maturity; or, to recall the\r\nfamiliar saying of a Western friend, never to go in where you couldn't\r\nwade. This water was altogether too deep for me.\r\n\r\nRegard for this rule has kept not only myself but my partners out of\r\ntrouble. Indeed, we had gone so far in our partnership agreement as to\r\nprevent ourselves from endorsing or committing ourselves in any way\r\nbeyond trifling sums, except for the firm. This I also gave as a\r\nreason why I could not endorse.\r\n\r\nDuring the period which these events cover I had made repeated\r\njourneys to Europe to negotiate various securities, and in all I sold\r\nsome thirty millions of dollars worth. This was at a time when the\r\nAtlantic cable had not yet made New York a part of London financially\r\nconsidered, and when London bankers would lend their balances to\r\nParis, Vienna, or Berlin for a shadow of difference in the rate of\r\ninterest rather than to the United States at a higher rate. The\r\nRepublic was considered less safe than the Continent by these good\r\npeople. My brother and Mr. Phipps conducted the iron business so\r\nsuccessfully that I could leave for weeks at a time without anxiety.\r\nThere was danger lest I should drift away from the manufacturing to\r\nthe financial and banking business. My successes abroad brought me\r\ntempting opportunities, but my preference was always for\r\nmanufacturing. I wished to make something tangible and sell it and I\r\ncontinued to invest my profits in extending the works at Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nThe small shops put up originally for the Keystone Bridge Company had\r\nbeen leased for other purposes and ten acres of ground had been\r\nsecured in Lawrenceville on which new and extensive shops were\r\nerected. Repeated additions to the Union Iron Mills had made them the\r\nleading mills in the United States for all sorts of structural shapes.\r\nBusiness was promising and all the surplus earnings I was making in\r\nother fields were required to expand the iron business. I had become\r\ninterested, with my friends of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, in\r\nbuilding some railways in the Western States, but gradually withdrew\r\nfrom all such enterprises and made up my mind to go entirely contrary\r\nto the adage not to put all one's eggs in one basket. I determined\r\nthat the proper policy was \"to put all good eggs in one basket and\r\nthen watch that basket.\"\r\n\r\nI believe the true road to preëminent success in any line is to make\r\nyourself master in that line. I have no faith in the policy of\r\nscattering one's resources, and in my experience I have rarely if ever\r\nmet a man who achieved preëminence in money-making--certainly never\r\none in manufacturing--who was interested in many concerns. The men who\r\nhave succeeded are men who have chosen one line and stuck to it. It is\r\nsurprising how few men appreciate the enormous dividends derivable\r\nfrom investment in their own business. There is scarcely a\r\nmanufacturer in the world who has not in his works some machinery that\r\nshould be thrown out and replaced by improved appliances; or who does\r\nnot for the want of additional machinery or new methods lose more than\r\nsufficient to pay the largest dividend obtainable by investment beyond\r\nhis own domain. And yet most business men whom I have known invest in\r\nbank shares and in far-away enterprises, while the true gold mine lies\r\nright in their own factories.\r\n\r\nI have tried always to hold fast to this important fact. It has been\r\nwith me a cardinal doctrine that I could manage my own capital better\r\nthan any other person, much better than any board of directors. The\r\nlosses men encounter during a business life which seriously embarrass\r\nthem are rarely in their own business, but in enterprises of which the\r\ninvestor is not master. My advice to young men would be not only to\r\nconcentrate their whole time and attention on the one business in life\r\nin which they engage, but to put every dollar of their capital into\r\nit. If there be any business that will not bear extension, the true\r\npolicy is to invest the surplus in first-class securities which will\r\nyield a moderate but certain revenue if some other growing business\r\ncannot be found. As for myself my decision was taken early. I would\r\nconcentrate upon the manufacture of iron and steel and be master in\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nMy visits to Britain gave me excellent opportunities to renew and make\r\nacquaintance with those prominent in the iron and steel\r\nbusiness--Bessemer in the front, Sir Lothian Bell, Sir Bernard\r\nSamuelson, Sir Windsor Richards, Edward Martin, Bingley, Evans, and\r\nthe whole host of captains in that industry. My election to the\r\ncouncil, and finally to the presidency of the British Iron and Steel\r\nInstitute soon followed, I being the first president who was not a\r\nBritish subject. That honor was highly appreciated, although at first\r\ndeclined, because I feared that I could not give sufficient time to\r\nits duties, owing to my residence in America.\r\n\r\nAs we had been compelled to engage in the manufacture of wrought-iron\r\nin order to make bridges and other structures, so now we thought it\r\ndesirable to manufacture our own pig iron. And this led to the\r\nerection of the Lucy Furnace in the year 1870--a venture which would\r\nhave been postponed had we fully appreciated its magnitude. We heard\r\nfrom time to time the ominous predictions made by our older brethren\r\nin the manufacturing business with regard to the rapid growth and\r\nextension of our young concern, but we were not deterred. We thought\r\nwe had sufficient capital and credit to justify the building of one\r\nblast furnace.\r\n\r\nThe estimates made of its cost, however, did not cover more than half\r\nthe expenditure. It was an experiment with us. Mr. Kloman knew nothing\r\nabout blast-furnace operations. But even without exact knowledge no\r\nserious blunder was made. The yield of the Lucy Furnace (named after\r\nmy bright sister-in-law) exceeded our most sanguine expectations and\r\nthe then unprecedented output of a hundred tons per day was made from\r\none blast furnace, for one week--an output that the world had never\r\nheard of before. We held the record and many visitors came to marvel\r\nat the marvel.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, all smooth sailing with our iron business. Years\r\nof panic came at intervals. We had passed safely through the fall in\r\nvalues following the war, when iron from nine cents per pound dropped\r\nto three. Many failures occurred and our financial manager had his\r\ntime fully occupied in providing funds to meet emergencies. Among many\r\nwrecks our firm stood with credit unimpaired. But the manufacture of\r\npig iron gave us more anxiety than any other department of our\r\nbusiness so far. The greatest service rendered us in this branch of\r\nmanufacturing was by Mr. Whitwell, of the celebrated Whitwell Brothers\r\nof England, whose blast-furnace stoves were so generally used. Mr.\r\nWhitwell was one of the best-known of the visitors who came to marvel\r\nat the Lucy Furnace, and I laid the difficulty we then were\r\nexperiencing before him. He said immediately:\r\n\r\n\"That comes from the angle of the bell being wrong.\"\r\n\r\nHe explained how it should be changed. Our Mr. Kloman was slow to\r\nbelieve this, but I urged that a small glass-model furnace and two\r\nbells be made, one as the Lucy was and the other as Mr. Whitwell\r\nadvised it should be. This was done, and upon my next visit\r\nexperiments were made with each, the result being just as Mr. Whitwell\r\nhad foretold. Our bell distributed the large pieces to the sides of\r\nthe furnace, leaving the center a dense mass through which the blast\r\ncould only partially penetrate. The Whitwell bell threw the pieces to\r\nthe center leaving the circumference dense. This made all the\r\ndifference in the world. The Lucy's troubles were over.\r\n\r\nWhat a kind, big, broad man was Mr. Whitwell, with no narrow jealousy,\r\nno withholding his knowledge! We had in some departments learned new\r\nthings and were able to be of service to his firm in return. At all\r\nevents, after that everything we had was open to the Whitwells.\r\n[To-day, as I write, I rejoice that one of the two still is with us\r\nand that our friendship is still warm. He was my predecessor in the\r\npresidency of the British Iron and Steel Institute.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF STEEL\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking back to-day it seems incredible that only forty years ago\r\n(1870) chemistry in the United States was an almost unknown agent in\r\nconnection with the manufacture of pig iron. It was the agency, above\r\nall others, most needful in the manufacture of iron and steel. The\r\nblast-furnace manager of that day was usually a rude bully, generally\r\na foreigner, who in addition to his other acquirements was able to\r\nknock down a man now and then as a lesson to the other unruly spirits\r\nunder him. He was supposed to diagnose the condition of the furnace by\r\ninstinct, to possess some almost supernatural power of divination,\r\nlike his congener in the country districts who was reputed to be able\r\nto locate an oil well or water supply by means of a hazel rod. He was\r\na veritable quack doctor who applied whatever remedies occurred to him\r\nfor the troubles of his patient.\r\n\r\nThe Lucy Furnace was out of one trouble and into another, owing to the\r\ngreat variety of ores, limestone, and coke which were then supplied\r\nwith little or no regard to their component parts. This state of\r\naffairs became intolerable to us. We finally decided to dispense with\r\nthe rule-of-thumb-and-intuition manager, and to place a young man in\r\ncharge of the furnace. We had a young shipping clerk, Henry M. Curry,\r\nwho had distinguished himself, and it was resolved to make him\r\nmanager.\r\n\r\nMr. Phipps had the Lucy Furnace under his special charge. His daily\r\nvisits to it saved us from failure there. Not that the furnace was not\r\ndoing as well as other furnaces in the West as to money-making, but\r\nbeing so much larger than other furnaces its variations entailed much\r\nmore serious results. I am afraid my partner had something to answer\r\nfor in his Sunday morning visits to the Lucy Furnace when his good\r\nfather and sister left the house for more devotional duties. But even\r\nif he had gone with them his real earnest prayer could not but have\r\nhad reference at times to the precarious condition of the Lucy Furnace\r\nthen absorbing his thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe next step taken was to find a chemist as Mr. Curry's assistant and\r\nguide. We found the man in a learned German, Dr. Fricke, and great\r\nsecrets did the doctor open up to us. Iron stone from mines that had a\r\nhigh reputation was now found to contain ten, fifteen, and even twenty\r\nper cent less iron than it had been credited with. Mines that hitherto\r\nhad a poor reputation we found to be now yielding superior ore. The\r\ngood was bad and the bad was good, and everything was topsy-turvy.\r\nNine tenths of all the uncertainties of pig-iron making were dispelled\r\nunder the burning sun of chemical knowledge.\r\n\r\nAt a most critical period when it was necessary for the credit of the\r\nfirm that the blast furnace should make its best product, it had been\r\nstopped because an exceedingly rich and pure ore had been substituted\r\nfor an inferior ore--an ore which did not yield more than two thirds\r\nof the quantity of iron of the other. The furnace had met with\r\ndisaster because too much lime had been used to flux this\r\nexceptionally pure ironstone. The very superiority of the materials\r\nhad involved us in serious losses.\r\n\r\nWhat fools we had been! But then there was this consolation: we were\r\nnot as great fools as our competitors. It was years after we had taken\r\nchemistry to guide us that it was said by the proprietors of some\r\nother furnaces that they could not afford to employ a chemist. Had\r\nthey known the truth then, they would have known that they could not\r\nafford to be without one. Looking back it seems pardonable to record\r\nthat we were the first to employ a chemist at blast\r\nfurnaces--something our competitors pronounced extravagant.\r\n\r\nThe Lucy Furnace became the most profitable branch of our business,\r\nbecause we had almost the entire monopoly of scientific management.\r\nHaving discovered the secret, it was not long (1872) before we decided\r\nto erect an additional furnace. This was done with great economy as\r\ncompared with our first experiment. The mines which had no reputation\r\nand the products of which many firms would not permit to be used in\r\ntheir blast furnaces found a purchaser in us. Those mines which were\r\nable to obtain an enormous price for their products, owing to a\r\nreputation for quality, we quietly ignored. A curious illustration of\r\nthis was the celebrated Pilot Knob mine in Missouri. Its product was,\r\nso to speak, under a cloud. A small portion of it only could be used,\r\nit was said, without obstructing the furnace. Chemistry told us that\r\nit was low in phosphorus, but very high in silicon. There was no\r\nbetter ore and scarcely any as rich, if it were properly fluxed. We\r\ntherefore bought heavily of this and received the thanks of the\r\nproprietors for rendering their property valuable.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly believable that for several years we were able to dispose\r\nof the highly phosphoric cinder from the puddling furnaces at a higher\r\nprice than we had to pay for the pure cinder from the heating furnaces\r\nof our competitors--a cinder which was richer in iron than the puddled\r\ncinder and much freer from phosphorus. Upon some occasion a blast\r\nfurnace had attempted to smelt the flue cinder, and from its greater\r\npurity the furnace did not work well with a mixture intended for an\r\nimpurer article; hence for years it was thrown over the banks of the\r\nriver at Pittsburgh by our competitors as worthless. In some cases we\r\nwere even able to exchange a poor article for a good one and obtain a\r\nbonus.\r\n\r\nBut it is still more unbelievable that a prejudice, equally unfounded,\r\nexisted against putting into the blast furnaces the roll-scale from\r\nthe mills which was pure oxide of iron. This reminds me of my dear\r\nfriend and fellow-Dunfermline townsman, Mr. Chisholm, of Cleveland. We\r\nhad many pranks together. One day, when I was visiting his works at\r\nCleveland, I saw men wheeling this valuable roll-scale into the yard.\r\nI asked Mr. Chisholm where they were going with it, and he said:\r\n\r\n\"To throw it over the bank. Our managers have always complained that\r\nthey had bad luck when they attempted to remelt it in the blast\r\nfurnace.\"\r\n\r\nI said nothing, but upon my return to Pittsburgh I set about having a\r\njoke at his expense. We had then a young man in our service named Du\r\nPuy, whose father was known as the inventor of a direct process in\r\niron-making with which he was then experimenting in Pittsburgh. I\r\nrecommended our people to send Du Puy to Cleveland to contract for all\r\nthe roll-scale of my friend's establishment. He did so, buying it for\r\nfifty cents per ton and having it shipped to him direct. This\r\ncontinued for some time. I expected always to hear of the joke being\r\ndiscovered. The premature death of Mr. Chisholm occurred before I\r\ncould apprise him of it. His successors soon, however, followed our\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nI had not failed to notice the growth of the Bessemer process. If this\r\nproved successful I knew that iron was destined to give place to\r\nsteel; that the Iron Age would pass away and the Steel Age take its\r\nplace. My friend, John A. Wright, president of the Freedom Iron Works\r\nat Lewiston, Pennsylvania, had visited England purposely to\r\ninvestigate the new process. He was one of our best and most\r\nexperienced manufacturers, and his decision was so strongly in its\r\nfavor that he induced his company to erect Bessemer works. He was\r\nquite right, but just a little in advance of his time. The capital\r\nrequired was greater than he estimated. More than this, it was not to\r\nbe expected that a process which was even then in somewhat of an\r\nexperimental stage in Britain could be transplanted to the new country\r\nand operated successfully from the start. The experiment was certain\r\nto be long and costly, and for this my friend had not made sufficient\r\nallowance.\r\n\r\nAt a later date, when the process had become established in England,\r\ncapitalists began to erect the present Pennsylvania Steel Works at\r\nHarrisburg. These also had to pass through an experimental stage and\r\nat a critical moment would probably have been wrecked but for the\r\ntimely assistance of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. It required a\r\nbroad and able man like President Thomson, of the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad, to recommend to his board of directors that so large a sum\r\nas six hundred thousand dollars should be advanced to a manufacturing\r\nconcern on his road, that steel rails might be secured for the line.\r\nThe result fully justified his action.\r\n\r\nThe question of a substitute for iron rails upon the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad and other leading lines had become a very serious one. Upon\r\ncertain curves at Pittsburgh, on the road connecting the Pennsylvania\r\nwith the Fort Wayne, I had seen new iron rails placed every six weeks\r\nor two months. Before the Bessemer process was known I had called\r\nPresident Thomson's attention to the efforts of Mr. Dodds in England,\r\nwho had carbonized the heads of iron rails with good results. I went\r\nto England and obtained control of the Dodds patents and recommended\r\nPresident Thomson to appropriate twenty thousand dollars for\r\nexperiments at Pittsburgh, which he did. We built a furnace on our\r\ngrounds at the upper mill and treated several hundred tons of rails\r\nfor the Pennsylvania Railroad Company and with remarkably good results\r\nas compared with iron rails. These were the first hard-headed rails\r\nused in America. We placed them on some of the sharpest curves and\r\ntheir superior service far more than compensated for the advance made\r\nby Mr. Thomson. Had the Bessemer process not been successfully\r\ndeveloped, I verily believe that we should ultimately have been able\r\nto improve the Dodds process sufficiently to make its adoption\r\ngeneral. But there was nothing to be compared with the solid steel\r\narticle which the Bessemer process produced.\r\n\r\nOur friends of the Cambria Iron Company at Johnstown, near\r\nPittsburgh--the principal manufacturers of rails in America--decided\r\nto erect a Bessemer plant. In England I had seen it demonstrated, at\r\nleast to my satisfaction, that the process could be made a grand\r\nsuccess without undue expenditure of capital or great risk. Mr.\r\nWilliam Coleman, who was ever alive to new methods, arrived at the\r\nsame conclusion. It was agreed we should enter upon the manufacture of\r\nsteel rails at Pittsburgh. He became a partner and also my dear friend\r\nMr. David McCandless, who had so kindly offered aid to my mother at my\r\nfather's death. The latter was not forgotten. Mr. John Scott and Mr.\r\nDavid A. Stewart, and others joined me; Mr. Edgar Thomson and Mr.\r\nThomas A. Scott, president and vice-president of the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad, also became stockholders, anxious to encourage the\r\ndevelopment of steel. The steel-rail company was organized January 1,\r\n1873.\r\n\r\nThe question of location was the first to engage our serious\r\nattention. I could not reconcile myself to any location that was\r\nproposed, and finally went to Pittsburgh to consult with my partners\r\nabout it. The subject was constantly in my mind and in bed Sunday\r\nmorning the site suddenly appeared to me. I rose and called to my\r\nbrother:\r\n\r\n\"Tom, you and Mr. Coleman are right about the location; right at\r\nBraddock's, between the Pennsylvania, the Baltimore and Ohio, and the\r\nriver, is the best situation in America; and let's call the works\r\nafter our dear friend Edgar Thomson. Let us go over to Mr. Coleman's\r\nand drive out to Braddock's.\"\r\n\r\nWe did so that day, and the next morning Mr. Coleman was at work\r\ntrying to secure the property. Mr. McKinney, the owner, had a high\r\nidea of the value of his farm. What we had expected to purchase for\r\nfive or six hundred dollars an acre cost us two thousand. But since\r\nthen we have been compelled to add to our original purchase at a cost\r\nof five thousand dollars per acre.\r\n\r\nThere, on the very field of Braddock's defeat, we began the erection\r\nof our steel-rail mills. In excavating for the foundations many relics\r\nof the battle were found--bayonets, swords, and the like. It was there\r\nthat the then provost of Dunfermline, Sir Arthur Halkett, and his son\r\nwere slain. How did they come to be there will very naturally be\r\nasked. It must not be forgotten that, in those days, the provosts of\r\nthe cities of Britain were members of the aristocracy--the great men\r\nof the district who condescended to enjoy the honor of the position\r\nwithout performing the duties. No one in trade was considered good\r\nenough for the provostship. We have remnants of this aristocratic\r\nnotion throughout Britain to-day. There is scarcely any life assurance\r\nor railway company, or in some cases manufacturing company but must\r\nhave at its head, to enjoy the honors of the presidency, some titled\r\nperson totally ignorant of the duties of the position. So it was that\r\nSir Arthur Halkett, as a gentleman, was Provost of Dunfermline, but by\r\ncalling he followed the profession of arms and was killed on this\r\nspot. It was a coincidence that what had been the field of death to\r\ntwo native-born citizens of Dunfermline should be turned into an\r\nindustrial hive by two others.\r\n\r\nAnother curious fact has recently been discovered. Mr. John Morley's\r\naddress, in 1904 on Founder's Day at the Carnegie Institute,\r\nPittsburgh, referred to the capture of Fort Duquesne by General Forbes\r\nand his writing Prime Minister Pitt that he had rechristened it\r\n\"Pittsburgh\" for him. This General Forbes was then Laird of\r\nPittencrieff and was born in the Glen which I purchased in 1902 and\r\npresented to Dunfermline for a public park. So that two Dunfermline\r\nmen have been Lairds of Pittencrieff whose chief work was in\r\nPittsburgh. One named Pittsburgh and the other labored for its\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nIn naming the steel mills as we did the desire was to honor my friend\r\nEdgar Thomson, but when I asked permission to use his name his reply\r\nwas significant. He said that as far as American steel rails were\r\nconcerned, he did not feel that he wished to connect his name with\r\nthem, for they had proved to be far from creditable. Uncertainty was,\r\nof course, inseparable from the experimental stage; but, when I\r\nassured him that it was now possible to make steel rails in America\r\nas good in every particular as the foreign article, and that we\r\nintended to obtain for our rails the reputation enjoyed by the\r\nKeystone bridges and the Kloman axles, he consented.\r\n\r\nHe was very anxious to have us purchase land upon the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad, as his first thought was always for that company. This would\r\nhave given the Pennsylvania a monopoly of our traffic. When he visited\r\nPittsburgh a few months later and Mr. Robert Pitcairn, my successor as\r\nsuperintendent of the Pittsburgh Division of the Pennsylvania, pointed\r\nout to him the situation of the new works at Braddock's Station, which\r\ngave us not only a connection with his own line, but also with the\r\nrival Baltimore and Ohio line, and with a rival in one respect greater\r\nthan either--the Ohio River--he said, with a twinkle of his eye to\r\nRobert, as Robert told me:\r\n\r\n\"Andy should have located his works a few miles farther east.\" But Mr.\r\nThomson knew the good and sufficient reasons which determined the\r\nselection of the unrivaled site.\r\n\r\nThe works were well advanced when the financial panic of September,\r\n1873, came upon us. I then entered upon the most anxious period of my\r\nbusiness life. All was going well when one morning in our summer\r\ncottage, in the Allegheny Mountains at Cresson, a telegram came\r\nannouncing the failure of Jay Cooke & Co. Almost every hour after\r\nbrought news of some fresh disaster. House after house failed. The\r\nquestion every morning was which would go next. Every failure depleted\r\nthe resources of other concerns. Loss after loss ensued, until a total\r\nparalysis of business set in. Every weak spot was discovered and\r\nhouses that otherwise would have been strong were borne down largely\r\nbecause our country lacked a proper banking system.\r\n\r\nWe had not much reason to be anxious about our debts. Not what we had\r\nto pay of our own debts could give us much trouble, but rather what we\r\nmight have to pay for our debtors. It was not our bills payable but\r\nour bills receivable which required attention, for we soon had to\r\nbegin meeting both. Even our own banks had to beg us not to draw upon\r\nour balances. One incident will shed some light upon the currency\r\nsituation. One of our pay-days was approaching. One hundred thousand\r\ndollars in small notes were absolutely necessary, and to obtain these\r\nwe paid a premium of twenty-four hundred dollars in New York and had\r\nthem expressed to Pittsburgh. It was impossible to borrow money, even\r\nupon the best collaterals; but by selling securities, which I had in\r\nreserve, considerable sums were realized--the company undertaking to\r\nreplace them later.\r\n\r\nIt happened that some of the railway companies whose lines centered in\r\nPittsburgh owed us large sums for material furnished--the Fort Wayne\r\nroad being the largest debtor. I remember calling upon Mr. Thaw, the\r\nvice-president of the Fort Wayne, and telling him we must have our\r\nmoney. He replied:\r\n\r\n\"You ought to have your money, but we are not paying anything these\r\ndays that is not protestable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" I said, \"your freight bills are in that category and we\r\nshall follow your excellent example. Now I am going to order that we\r\ndo not pay you one dollar for freight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you do that,\" he said, \"we will stop your freight.\"\r\n\r\nI said we would risk that. The railway company could not proceed to\r\nthat extremity. And as a matter of fact we ran for some time without\r\npaying the freight bills. It was simply impossible for the\r\nmanufacturers of Pittsburgh to pay their accruing liabilities when\r\ntheir customers stopped payment. The banks were forced to renew\r\nmaturing paper. They behaved splendidly to us, as they always have\r\ndone, and we steered safely through. But in a critical period like\r\nthis there was one thought uppermost with me, to gather more capital\r\nand keep it in our business so that come what would we should never\r\nagain be called upon to endure such nights and days of racking\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nSpeaking for myself in this great crisis, I was at first the most\r\nexcited and anxious of the partners. I could scarcely control myself.\r\nBut when I finally saw the strength of our financial position I became\r\nphilosophically cool and found myself quite prepared, if necessary, to\r\nenter the directors' rooms of the various banks with which we dealt,\r\nand lay our entire position before their boards. I felt that this\r\ncould result in nothing discreditable to us. No one interested in our\r\nbusiness had lived extravagantly. Our manner of life had been the very\r\nreverse of this. No money had been withdrawn from the business to\r\nbuild costly homes, and, above all, not one of us had made speculative\r\nventures upon the stock exchange, or invested in any other enterprises\r\nthan those connected with the main business. Neither had we exchanged\r\nendorsements with others. Besides this we could show a prosperous\r\nbusiness that was making money every year.\r\n\r\nI was thus enabled to laugh away the fears of my partners, but none of\r\nthem rejoiced more than I did that the necessity for opening our lips\r\nto anybody about our finances did not arise. Mr. Coleman, good friend\r\nand true, with plentiful means and splendid credit, did not fail to\r\nvolunteer to give us his endorsements. In this we stood alone; William\r\nColeman's name, a tower of strength, was for us only. How the grand\r\nold man comes before me as I write. His patriotism knew no bounds.\r\nOnce when visiting his mills, stopped for the Fourth of July, as they\r\nalways were, he found a corps of men at work repairing the boilers. He\r\ncalled the manager to him and asked what this meant. He ordered all\r\nwork suspended.\r\n\r\n\"Work on the Fourth of July!\" he exclaimed, \"when there's plenty of\r\nSundays for repairs!\" He was furious.\r\n\r\nWhen the cyclone of 1873 struck us we at once began to reef sail in\r\nevery quarter. Very reluctantly did we decide that the construction of\r\nthe new steel works must cease for a time. Several prominent persons,\r\nwho had invested in them, became unable to meet their payments and I\r\nwas compelled to take over their interests, repaying the full cost to\r\nall. In that way control of the company came into my hands.\r\n\r\nThe first outburst of the storm had affected the financial world\r\nconnected with the Stock Exchange. It was some time before it reached\r\nthe commercial and manufacturing world. But the situation grew worse\r\nand worse and finally led to the crash which involved my friends in\r\nthe Texas Pacific enterprise, of which I have already spoken. This was\r\nto me the severest blow of all. People could, with difficulty, believe\r\nthat occupying such intimate relations as I did with the Texas group,\r\nI could by any possibility have kept myself clear of their financial\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\nMr. Schoenberger, president of the Exchange Bank at Pittsburgh, with\r\nwhich we conducted a large business, was in New York when the news\r\nreached him of the embarrassment of Mr. Scott and Mr. Thomson. He\r\nhastened to Pittsburgh, and at a meeting of his board next morning\r\nsaid it was simply impossible that I was not involved with them. He\r\nsuggested that the bank should refuse to discount more of our bills\r\nreceivable. He was alarmed to find that the amount of these bearing\r\nour endorsement and under discount, was so large. Prompt action on my\r\npart was necessary to prevent serious trouble. I took the first train\r\nfor Pittsburgh, and was able to announce there to all concerned that,\r\nalthough I was a shareholder in the Texas enterprise, my interest was\r\npaid for. My name was not upon one dollar of their paper or of any\r\nother outstanding paper. I stood clear and clean without a financial\r\nobligation or property which I did not own and which was not fully\r\npaid for. My only obligations were those connected with our business;\r\nand I was prepared to pledge for it every dollar I owned, and to\r\nendorse every obligation the firm had outstanding.\r\n\r\nUp to this time I had the reputation in business of being a bold,\r\nfearless, and perhaps a somewhat reckless young man. Our operations\r\nhad been extensive, our growth rapid and, although still young, I had\r\nbeen handling millions. My own career was thought by the elderly ones\r\nof Pittsburgh to have been rather more brilliant than substantial. I\r\nknow of an experienced one who declared that if \"Andrew Carnegie's\r\nbrains did not carry him through his luck would.\" But I think nothing\r\ncould be farther from the truth than the estimate thus suggested. I am\r\nsure that any competent judge would be surprised to find how little I\r\never risked for myself or my partners. When I did big things, some\r\nlarge corporation like the Pennsylvania Railroad Company was behind me\r\nand the responsible party. My supply of Scotch caution never has been\r\nsmall; but I was apparently something of a dare-devil now and then to\r\nthe manufacturing fathers of Pittsburgh. They were old and I was\r\nyoung, which made all the difference.\r\n\r\nThe fright which Pittsburgh financial institutions had with regard to\r\nmyself and our enterprises rapidly gave place to perhaps somewhat\r\nunreasoning confidence. Our credit became unassailable, and thereafter\r\nin times of financial pressure the offerings of money to us increased\r\nrather than diminished, just as the deposits of the old Bank of\r\nPittsburgh were never so great as when the deposits in other banks ran\r\nlow. It was the only bank in America which redeemed its circulation in\r\ngold, disdaining to take refuge under the law and pay its obligations\r\nin greenbacks. It had few notes, and I doubt not the decision paid as\r\nan advertisement.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the embarrassment of my friends Mr. Scott, Mr. Thomson,\r\nand others, there came upon us later an even severer trial in the\r\ndiscovery that our partner, Mr. Andrew Kloman, had been led by a party\r\nof speculative people into the Escanaba Iron Company. He was assured\r\nthat the concern was to be made a stock company, but before this was\r\ndone his colleagues had succeeded in creating an enormous amount of\r\nliabilities--about seven hundred thousand dollars. There was nothing\r\nbut bankruptcy as a means of reinstating Mr. Kloman.\r\n\r\nThis gave us more of a shock than all that had preceded, because Mr.\r\nKloman, being a partner, had no right to invest in another iron\r\ncompany, or in any other company involving personal debt, without\r\ninforming his partners. There is one imperative rule for men in\r\nbusiness--no secrets from partners. Disregard of this rule involved\r\nnot only Mr. Kloman himself, but our company, in peril, coming, as it\r\ndid, atop of the difficulties of my Texas Pacific friends with whom I\r\nhad been intimately associated. The question for a time was whether\r\nthere was anything really sound. Where could we find bedrock upon\r\nwhich we could stand?\r\n\r\nHad Mr. Kloman been a business man it would have been impossible ever\r\nto allow him to be a partner with us again after this discovery. He\r\nwas not such, however, but the ablest of practical mechanics with some\r\nbusiness ability. Mr. Kloman's ambition had been to be in the office,\r\nwhere he was worse than useless, rather than in the mill devising and\r\nrunning new machinery, where he was without a peer. We had some\r\ndifficulty in placing him in his proper position and keeping him\r\nthere, which may have led him to seek an outlet elsewhere. He was\r\nperhaps flattered by men who were well known in the community; and in\r\nthis case he was led by persons who knew how to reach him by extolling\r\nhis wonderful business abilities in addition to his mechanical\r\ngenius--abilities which his own partners, as already suggested, but\r\nfaintly recognized.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Kloman had passed through the bankruptcy court and was again\r\nfree, we offered him a ten per cent interest in our business, charging\r\nfor it only the actual capital invested, with nothing whatever for\r\ngood-will. This we were to carry for him until the profits paid for\r\nit. We were to charge interest only on the cost, and he was to assume\r\nno responsibility. The offer was accompanied by the condition that he\r\nshould not enter into any other business or endorse for others, but\r\ngive his whole time and attention to the mechanical and not the\r\nbusiness management of the mills. Could he have been persuaded to\r\naccept this, he would have been a multimillionaire; but his pride, and\r\nmore particularly that of his family, perhaps, would not permit this.\r\nHe would go into business on his own account, and, notwithstanding\r\nthe most urgent appeals on my part, and that of my colleagues, he\r\npersisted in the determination to start a new rival concern with his\r\nsons as business managers. The result was failure and premature death.\r\n\r\nHow foolish we are not to recognize what we are best fitted for and\r\ncan perform, not only with ease but with pleasure, as masters of the\r\ncraft. More than one able man I have known has persisted in blundering\r\nin an office when he had great talent for the mill, and has worn\r\nhimself out, oppressed with cares and anxieties, his life a continual\r\nround of misery, and the result at last failure. I never regretted\r\nparting with any man so much as Mr. Kloman. His was a good heart, a\r\ngreat mechanical brain, and had he been left to himself I believe he\r\nwould have been glad to remain with us. Offers of capital from\r\nothers--offers which failed when needed--turned his head, and the\r\ngreat mechanic soon proved the poor man of affairs.[33]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Long after the circumstances here recited, Mr. Isidor\r\nStraus called upon Mr. Henry Phipps and asked him if two statements\r\nwhich had been publicly made about Mr. Carnegie and his partners in\r\nthe steel company were true. Mr. Phipps replied they were not. Then\r\nsaid Mr. Straus:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Phipps, you owe it to yourself and also to Mr. Carnegie to say so\r\npublicly.\"\r\n\r\nThis Mr. Phipps did in the _New York Herald_, January 30, 1904, in the\r\nfollowing handsome manner and without Mr. Carnegie's knowledge:\r\n\r\n_Question:_ \"In a recent publication mention was made of Mr.\r\nCarnegie's not having treated Mr. Miller, Mr. Kloman, and yourself\r\nproperly during your early partnership, and at its termination. Can\r\nyou tell me anything about this?\"\r\n\r\n_Answer:_ \"Mr. Miller has already spoken for himself in this matter,\r\nand I can say that the treatment received from Mr. Carnegie during our\r\npartnership, so far as I was concerned, was always fair and liberal.\r\n\r\n\"My association with Mr. Kloman in business goes back forty-three\r\nyears. Everything in connection with Mr. Carnegie's partnership with\r\nMr. Kloman was of a pleasant nature.\r\n\r\n\"At a much more recent date, when the firm of Carnegie, Kloman and\r\nCompany was formed, the partners were Andrew Carnegie, Thomas M.\r\nCarnegie, Andrew Kloman, and myself. The Carnegies held the\r\ncontrolling interest.\r\n\r\n\"After the partnership agreement was signed, Mr. Kloman said to me\r\nthat the Carnegies, owning the larger interest, might be too\r\nenterprising in making improvements, which might lead us into serious\r\ntrouble; and he thought that they should consent to an article in the\r\npartnership agreement requiring the consent of three partners to make\r\neffective any vote for improvements. I told him that we could not\r\nexact what he asked, as their larger interest assured them control,\r\nbut I would speak to them. When the subject was broached, Mr. Carnegie\r\npromptly said that if he could not carry Mr. Kloman or myself with his\r\nbrother in any improvements he would not wish them made. Other matters\r\nwere arranged by courtesy during our partnership in the same manner.\"\r\n\r\n_Question:_ \"What you have told me suggests the question, why did Mr.\r\nKloman leave the firm?\"\r\n\r\n_Answer:_ \"During the great depression which followed the panic of\r\n1873, Mr. Kloman, through an unfortunate partnership in the Escanaba\r\nFurnace Company, lost his means, and his interest in our firm had to\r\nbe disposed of. We bought it at book value at a time when\r\nmanufacturing properties were selling at ruinous prices, often as low\r\nas one third or one half their cost.\r\n\r\n\"After the settlement had been made with the creditors of the Escanaba\r\nCompany, Mr. Kloman was offered an interest by Mr. Carnegie of\r\n$100,000 in our firm, to be paid only from future profits. This Mr.\r\nKloman declined, as he did not feel like taking an interest which\r\nformerly had been much larger. Mr. Carnegie gave him $40,000 from the\r\nfirm to make a new start. This amount was invested in a rival concern,\r\nwhich soon closed.\r\n\r\n\"I knew of no disagreement during this early period with Mr. Carnegie,\r\nand their relations continued pleasant as long as Mr. Kloman lived.\r\nHarmony always marked their intercourse, and they had the kindliest\r\nfeeling one for the other.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nPARTNERS, BOOKS, AND TRAVEL\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Kloman had severed his connection with us there was no\r\nhesitation in placing William Borntraeger in charge of the mills. It\r\nhas always been with especial pleasure that I have pointed to the\r\ncareer of William. He came direct from Germany--a young man who could\r\nnot speak English, but being distantly connected with Mr. Kloman was\r\nemployed in the mills, at first in a minor capacity. He promptly\r\nlearned English and became a shipping clerk at six dollars per week.\r\nHe had not a particle of mechanical knowledge, and yet such was his\r\nunflagging zeal and industry for the interests of his employer that he\r\nsoon became marked for being everywhere about the mill, knowing\r\neverything, and attending to everything.\r\n\r\nWilliam was a character. He never got over his German idioms and his\r\ninverted English made his remarks very effective. Under his\r\nsuperintendence the Union Iron Mills became a most profitable branch\r\nof our business. He had overworked himself after a few years'\r\napplication and we decided to give him a trip to Europe. He came to\r\nNew York by way of Washington. When he called upon me in New York he\r\nexpressed himself as more anxious to return to Pittsburgh than to\r\nrevisit Germany. In ascending the Washington Monument he had seen the\r\nCarnegie beams in the stairway and also at other points in public\r\nbuildings, and as he expressed it:\r\n\r\n\"It yust make me so broud dat I want to go right back and see dat\r\neveryting is going right at de mill.\"\r\n\r\nEarly hours in the morning and late in the dark hours at night\r\nWilliam was in the mills. His life was there. He was among the first\r\nof the young men we admitted to partnership, and the poor German lad\r\nat his death was in receipt of an income, as I remember, of about\r\n$50,000 a year, every cent of which was deserved. Stories about him\r\nare many. At a dinner of our partners to celebrate the year's\r\nbusiness, short speeches were in order from every one. William summed\r\nup his speech thus:\r\n\r\n\"What we haf to do, shentlemens, is to get brices up and costs down\r\nand efery man _stand on his own bottom_.\" There was loud, prolonged,\r\nand repeated laughter.\r\n\r\nCaptain Evans (\"Fighting Bob\") was at one time government inspector at\r\nour mills. He was a severe one. William was sorely troubled at times\r\nand finally offended the Captain, who complained of his behavior. We\r\ntried to get William to realize the importance of pleasing a\r\ngovernment official. William's reply was:\r\n\r\n\"But he gomes in and smokes my cigars\" (bold Captain! William reveled\r\nin one-cent Wheeling tobies) \"and then he goes and contems my iron.\r\nWhat does you tinks of a man like dat? But I apologize and dreat him\r\nright to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain was assured William had agreed to make due amends, but he\r\nlaughingly told us afterward that William's apology was:\r\n\r\n\"Vell, Captain, I hope you vas all right dis morning. I haf noting\r\nagainst you, Captain,\" holding out his hand, which the Captain finally\r\ntook and all was well.\r\n\r\nWilliam once sold to our neighbor, the pioneer steel-maker of\r\nPittsburgh, James Park, a large lot of old rails which we could not\r\nuse. Mr. Park found them of a very bad quality. He made claims for\r\ndamages and William was told that he must go with Mr. Phipps to meet\r\nMr. Park and settle. Mr. Phipps went into Mr. Park's office, while\r\nWilliam took a look around the works in search of the condemned\r\nmaterial, which was nowhere to be seen. Well did William know where to\r\nlook. He finally entered the office, and before Mr. Park had time to\r\nsay a word William began:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Park, I vas glad to hear dat de old rails what I sell you don't\r\nsuit for steel. I will buy dem all from you back, five dollars ton\r\nprofit for you.\" Well did William know that they had all been used.\r\nMr. Park was non-plussed, and the affair ended. William had triumphed.\r\n\r\nUpon one of my visits to Pittsburgh William told me he had something\r\n\"particular\" he wished to tell me--something he couldn't tell any one\r\nelse. This was upon his return from the trip to Germany. There he had\r\nbeen asked to visit for a few days a former schoolfellow, who had\r\nrisen to be a professor:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Carnegie, his sister who kept his house was very kind to\r\nme, and ven I got to Hamburg I tought I sent her yust a little\r\npresent. She write me a letter, then I write her a letter. She write\r\nme and I write her, and den I ask her would she marry me. She was very\r\neducated, but she write yes. Den I ask her to come to New York, and I\r\nmeet her dere, but, Mr. Carnegie, dem people don't know noting about\r\nbusiness and de mills. Her bruder write me dey want me to go dere\r\nagain and marry her in Chairmany, and I can go away not again from de\r\nmills. I tought I yust ask you aboud it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you can go again. Quite right, William, you should go. I\r\nthink the better of her people for feeling so. You go over at once and\r\nbring her home. I'll arrange it.\" Then, when parting, I said:\r\n\"William, I suppose your sweetheart is a beautiful, tall,\r\n'peaches-and-cream' kind of German young lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vell, Mr. Carnegie, she is a leetle stout. If _I had the rolling of\r\nher I give her yust one more pass_.\" All William's illustrations were\r\nfounded on mill practice. [I find myself bursting into fits of\r\nlaughter this morning (June, 1912) as I re-read this story. But I did\r\nthis also when reading that \"Every man must stand on his own bottom.\"]\r\n\r\nMr. Phipps had been head of the commercial department of the mills,\r\nbut when our business was enlarged, he was required for the steel\r\nbusiness. Another young man, William L. Abbott, took his place. Mr.\r\nAbbott's history is somewhat akin to Borntraeger's. He came to us as a\r\nclerk upon a small salary and was soon assigned to the front in charge\r\nof the business of the iron mills. He was no less successful than was\r\nWilliam. He became a partner with an interest equal to William's, and\r\nfinally was promoted to the presidency of the company.\r\n\r\nMr. Curry had distinguished himself by this time in his management of\r\nthe Lucy Furnaces, and he took his place among the partners, sharing\r\nequally with the others. There is no way of making a business\r\nsuccessful that can vie with the policy of promoting those who render\r\nexceptional service. We finally converted the firm of Carnegie,\r\nMcCandless & Co. into the Edgar Thomson Steel Company, and included my\r\nbrother and Mr. Phipps, both of whom had declined at first to go into\r\nthe steel business with their too enterprising senior. But when I\r\nshowed them the earnings for the first year and told them if they did\r\nnot get into steel they would find themselves in the wrong boat, they\r\nboth reconsidered and came with us. It was fortunate for them as for\r\nus.\r\n\r\nMy experience has been that no partnership of new men gathered\r\npromiscuously from various fields can prove a good working\r\norganization as at first constituted. Changes are required. Our Edgar\r\nThomson Steel Company was no exception to this rule. Even before we\r\nbegan to make rails, Mr. Coleman became dissatisfied with the\r\nmanagement of a railway official who had come to us with a great and\r\ndeserved reputation for method and ability. I had, therefore, to take\r\nover Mr. Coleman's interest. It was not long, however, before we found\r\nthat his judgment was correct. The new man had been a railway auditor,\r\nand was excellent in accounts, but it was unjust to expect him, or any\r\nother office man, to be able to step into manufacturing and be\r\nsuccessful from the start. He had neither the knowledge nor the\r\ntraining for this new work. This does not mean that he was not a\r\nsplendid auditor. It was our own blunder in expecting the impossible.\r\n\r\nThe mills were at last about ready to begin[34] and an organization\r\nthe auditor proposed was laid before me for approval. I found he had\r\ndivided the works into two departments and had given control of one to\r\nMr. Stevenson, a Scotsman who afterwards made a fine record as a\r\nmanufacturer, and control of the other to a Mr. Jones. Nothing, I am\r\ncertain, ever affected the success of the steel company more than the\r\ndecision which I gave upon that proposal. Upon no account could two\r\nmen be in the same works with equal authority. An army with two\r\ncommanders-in-chief, a ship with two captains, could not fare more\r\ndisastrously than a manufacturing concern with two men in command upon\r\nthe same ground, even though in two different departments. I said:\r\n\r\n\"This will not do. I do not know Mr. Stevenson, nor do I know Mr.\r\nJones, but one or the other must be made captain and he alone must\r\nreport to you.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: The steel-rail mills were ready and rails were rolled in\r\n1874.]\r\n\r\nThe decision fell upon Mr. Jones and in this way we obtained \"The\r\nCaptain,\" who afterward made his name famous wherever the manufacture\r\nof Bessemer steel is known.\r\n\r\nThe Captain was then quite young, spare and active, bearing traces of\r\nhis Welsh descent even in his stature, for he was quite short. He came\r\nto us as a two-dollar-a-day mechanic from the neighboring works at\r\nJohnstown. We soon saw that he was a character. Every movement told\r\nit. He had volunteered as a private during the Civil War and carried\r\nhimself so finely that he became captain of a company which was never\r\nknown to flinch. Much of the success of the Edgar Thomson Works\r\nbelongs to this man.\r\n\r\nIn later years he declined an interest in the firm which would have\r\nmade him a millionaire. I told him one day that some of the young men\r\nwho had been given an interest were now making much more than he was\r\nand we had voted to make him a partner. This entailed no financial\r\nresponsibility, as we always provided that the cost of the interest\r\ngiven was payable only out of profits.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said, \"I don't want to have my thoughts running on business.\r\nI have enough trouble looking after these works. Just give me a h--l\r\nof a salary if you think I'm worth it.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Captain, the salary of the President of the United States\r\nis yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the talk,\" said the little Welshman.[35]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: The story is told that when Mr. Carnegie was selecting\r\nhis younger partners he one day sent for a young Scotsman, Alexander\r\nR. Peacock, and asked him rather abruptly:\r\n\r\n\"Peacock, what would you give to be made a millionaire?\"\r\n\r\n\"A liberal discount for cash, sir,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\nHe was a partner owning a two per cent interest when the Carnegie\r\nSteel Company was merged into the United States Steel Corporation.]\r\n\r\nOur competitors in steel were at first disposed to ignore us. Knowing\r\nthe difficulties they had in starting their own steel works, they\r\ncould not believe we would be ready to deliver rails for another year\r\nand declined to recognize us as competitors. The price of steel rails\r\nwhen we began was about seventy dollars per ton. We sent our agent\r\nthrough the country with instructions to take orders at the best\r\nprices he could obtain; and before our competitors knew it, we had\r\nobtained a large number--quite sufficient to justify us in making a\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nSo perfect was the machinery, so admirable the plans, so skillful were\r\nthe men selected by Captain Jones, and so great a manager was he\r\nhimself, that our success was phenomenal. I think I place a unique\r\nstatement on record when I say that the result of the first month's\r\noperations left a margin of profit of $11,000. It is also remarkable\r\nthat so perfect was our system of accounts that we knew the exact\r\namount of the profit. We had learned from experience in our iron works\r\nwhat exact accounting meant. There is nothing more profitable than\r\nclerks to check up each transfer of material from one department to\r\nanother in process of manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe new venture in steel having started off so promisingly, I began to\r\nthink of taking a holiday, and my long-cherished purpose of going\r\naround the world came to the front. Mr. J.W. Vandevort (\"Vandy\") and I\r\naccordingly set out in the autumn of 1878. I took with me several pads\r\nsuitable for penciling and began to make a few notes day by day, not\r\nwith any intention of publishing a book; but thinking, perhaps, I\r\nmight print a few copies of my notes for private circulation. The\r\nsensation which one has when he first sees his remarks in the form of\r\na printed book is great. When the package came from the printers I\r\nre-read the book trying to decide whether it was worth while to send\r\ncopies to my friends. I came to the conclusion that upon the whole it\r\nwas best to do so and await the verdict.\r\n\r\nThe writer of a book designed for his friends has no reason to\r\nanticipate an unkind reception, but there is always some danger of its\r\nbeing damned with faint praise. The responses in my case, however,\r\nexceeded expectations, and were of such a character as to satisfy me\r\nthat the writers really had enjoyed the book, or meant at least a part\r\nof what they said about it. Every author is prone to believe sweet\r\nwords. Among the first that came were in a letter from Anthony Drexel,\r\nPhiladelphia's great banker, complaining that I had robbed him of\r\nseveral hours of sleep. Having begun the book he could not lay it down\r\nand retired at two o'clock in the morning after finishing. Several\r\nsimilar letters were received. I remember Mr. Huntington, president of\r\nthe Central Pacific Railway, meeting me one morning and saying he was\r\ngoing to pay me a great compliment.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" Tasked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I read your book from end to end.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I said, \"that is not such a great compliment. Others of our\r\nmutual friends have done that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, but probably none of your friends are like me. I have not\r\nread a book for years except my ledger and I did not intend to read\r\nyours, but when I began it I could not lay it down. My ledger is the\r\nonly book I have gone through for five years.\"\r\n\r\nI was not disposed to credit all that my friends said, but others who\r\nhad obtained the book from them were pleased with it and I lived for\r\nsome months under intoxicating, but I trust not perilously pernicious,\r\nflattery. Several editions of the book were printed to meet the\r\nrequest for copies. Some notices of it and extracts got into the\r\npapers, and finally Charles Scribner's Sons asked to publish it for\r\nthe market. So \"Round the World\"[36] came before the public and I was\r\nat last \"an author.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: _Round the World_, by Andrew Carnegie. New York and\r\nLondon, 1884.]\r\n\r\nA new horizon was opened up to me by this voyage. It quite changed my\r\nintellectual outlook. Spencer and Darwin were then high in the zenith,\r\nand I had become deeply interested in their work. I began to view the\r\nvarious phases of human life from the standpoint of the evolutionist.\r\nIn China I read Confucius; in India, Buddha and the sacred books of\r\nthe Hindoos; among the Parsees, in Bombay, I studied Zoroaster. The\r\nresult of my journey was to bring a certain mental peace. Where there\r\nhad been chaos there was now order. My mind was at rest. I had a\r\nphilosophy at last. The words of Christ \"The Kingdom of Heaven is\r\nwithin you,\" had a new meaning for me. Not in the past or in the\r\nfuture, but now and here is Heaven within us. All our duties lie in\r\nthis world and in the present, and trying impatiently to peer into\r\nthat which lies beyond is as vain as fruitless.\r\n\r\nAll the remnants of theology in which I had been born and bred, all\r\nthe impressions that Swedenborg had made upon me, now ceased to\r\ninfluence me or to occupy my thoughts. I found that no nation had all\r\nthe truth in the revelation it regards as divine, and no tribe is so\r\nlow as to be left without some truth; that every people has had its\r\ngreat teacher; Buddha for one; Confucius for another; Zoroaster for a\r\nthird; Christ for a fourth. The teachings of all these I found\r\nethically akin so that I could say with Matthew Arnold, one I was so\r\nproud to call friend:\r\n\r\n    \"Children of men! the unseen Power, whose eye\r\n    For ever doth accompany mankind\r\n    Hath looked on no religion scornfully\r\n        That men did ever find.\r\n\r\n    Which has not taught weak wills how much they can?\r\n    Which has not fall'n in the dry heart like rain?\r\n    Which has not cried to sunk, self-weary man,\r\n        _Thou must be born again_.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Light of Asia,\" by Edwin Arnold, came out at this time and gave\r\nme greater delight than any similar poetical work I had recently read.\r\nI had just been in India and the book took me there again. My\r\nappreciation of it reached the author's ears and later having made his\r\nacquaintance in London, he presented me with the original manuscript\r\nof the book. It is one of my most precious treasures. Every person who\r\ncan, even at a sacrifice, make the voyage around the world should do\r\nso. All other travel compared to it seems incomplete, gives us merely\r\nvague impressions of parts of the whole. When the circle has been\r\ncompleted, you feel on your return that you have seen (of course only\r\nin the mass) all there is to be seen. The parts fit into one\r\nsymmetrical whole and you see humanity wherever it is placed working\r\nout a destiny tending to one definite end.\r\n\r\nThe world traveler who gives careful study to the bibles of the\r\nvarious religions of the East will be well repaid. The conclusion\r\nreached will be that the inhabitants of each country consider their\r\nown religion the best of all. They rejoice that their lot has been\r\ncast where it is, and are disposed to pity the less fortunate\r\ncondemned to live beyond their sacred limits. The masses of all\r\nnations are usually happy, each mass certain that:\r\n\r\n    \"East or West\r\n    Home is best.\"\r\n\r\nTwo illustrations of this from our \"Round the World\" trip may be\r\nnoted:\r\n\r\n     Visiting the tapioca workers in the woods near Singapore, we\r\n     found them busily engaged, the children running about stark\r\n     naked, the parents clothed in the usual loose rags. Our\r\n     party attracted great attention. We asked our guide to tell\r\n     the people that we came from a country where the water in\r\n     such a pond as that before us would become solid at this\r\n     season of the year and we could walk upon it and that\r\n     sometimes it would be so hard horses and wagons crossed wide\r\n     rivers on the ice. They wondered and asked why we didn't\r\n     come and live among them. They really were very happy.\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n     On the way to the North Cape we visited a reindeer camp of\r\n     the Laplanders. A sailor from the ship was deputed to go\r\n     with the party. I walked homeward with him, and as we\r\n     approached the fiord looking down and over to the opposite\r\n     shore we saw a few straggling huts and one two-story house\r\n     under construction. What is that new building for? we asked.\r\n\r\n     \"That is to be the home of a man born in Tromso who has made\r\n     a great deal of money and has now come back to spend his\r\n     days there. He is very rich.\"\r\n\r\n     \"You told me you had travelled all over the world. You have\r\n     seen London, New York, Calcutta, Melbourne, and other\r\n     places. If you made a fortune like that man what place would\r\n     you make your home in old age?\" His eye glistened as he\r\n     said:\r\n\r\n     \"Ah, there's no place like Tromso.\" This is in the arctic\r\n     circle, six months of night, but he had been born in Tromso.\r\n     Home, sweet, sweet home!\r\n\r\nAmong the conditions of life or the laws of nature, some of which seem\r\nto us faulty, some apparently unjust and merciless, there are many\r\nthat amaze us by their beauty and sweetness. Love of home, regardless\r\nof its character or location, certainly is one of these. And what a\r\npleasure it is to find that, instead of the Supreme Being confining\r\nrevelation to one race or nation, every race has the message best\r\nadapted for it in its present stage of development. The Unknown Power\r\nhas neglected none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nCOACHING TRIP AND MARRIAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Freedom of my native town (Dunfermline) was conferred upon me July\r\n12, 1877, the first Freedom and the greatest honor I ever received. I\r\nwas overwhelmed. Only two signatures upon the roll came between mine\r\nand Sir Walter Scott's, who had been made a Burgess. My parents had\r\nseen him one day sketching Dunfermline Abbey and often told me about\r\nhis appearance. My speech in reply to the Freedom was the subject of\r\nmuch concern. I spoke to my Uncle Bailie Morrison, telling him I just\r\nfelt like saying so and so, as this really was in my heart. He was an\r\norator himself and he spoke words of wisdom to me then.\r\n\r\n\"Just say that, Andra; nothing like saying just what you really feel.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a lesson in public speaking which I took to heart. There is one\r\nrule I might suggest for youthful orators. When you stand up before an\r\naudience reflect that there are before you only men and women. You\r\nshould speak to them as you speak to other men and women in daily\r\nintercourse. If you are not trying to be something different from\r\nyourself, there is no more occasion for embarrassment than if you were\r\ntalking in your office to a party of your own people--none whatever.\r\nIt is trying to be other than one's self that unmans one. Be your own\r\nnatural self and go ahead. I once asked Colonel Ingersoll, the most\r\neffective public speaker I ever heard, to what he attributed his\r\npower. \"Avoid elocutionists like snakes,\" he said, \"and be yourself.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN AMERICAN FOUR-IN-HAND IN BRITAIN]\r\n\r\nI spoke again at Dunfermline, July 27, 1881, when my mother laid the\r\nfoundation stone there of the first free library building I ever gave.\r\nMy father was one of five weavers who founded the earliest library in\r\nthe town by opening their own books to their neighbors. Dunfermline\r\nnamed the building I gave \"Carnegie Library.\" The architect asked for\r\nmy coat of arms. I informed him I had none, but suggested that above\r\nthe door there might be carved a rising sun shedding its rays with the\r\nmotto: \"Let there be light.\" This he adopted.\r\n\r\nWe had come up to Dunfermline with a coaching party. When walking\r\nthrough England in the year 1867 with George Lauder and Harry Phipps I\r\nhad formed the idea of coaching from Brighton to Inverness with a\r\nparty of my dearest friends. The time had come for the long-promised\r\ntrip, and in the spring of 1881 we sailed from New York, a party of\r\neleven, to enjoy one of the happiest excursions of my life. It was one\r\nof the holidays from business that kept me young and happy--worth all\r\nthe medicine in the world.\r\n\r\nAll the notes I made of the coaching trip were a few lines a day in\r\ntwopenny pass-books bought before we started. As with \"Round the\r\nWorld,\" I thought that I might some day write a magazine article, or\r\ngive some account of my excursion for those who accompanied me; but\r\none wintry day I decided that it was scarcely worth while to go down\r\nto the New York office, three miles distant, and the question was how\r\nI should occupy the spare time. I thought of the coaching trip, and\r\ndecided to write a few lines just to see how I should get on. The\r\nnarrative flowed freely, and before the day was over I had written\r\nbetween three and four thousand words. I took up the pleasing task\r\nevery stormy day when it was unnecessary for me to visit the office,\r\nand in exactly twenty sittings I had finished a book. I handed the\r\nnotes to Scribner's people and asked them to print a few hundred\r\ncopies for private circulation. The volume pleased my friends, as\r\n\"Round the World\" had done. Mr. Champlin one day told me that Mr.\r\nScribner had read the book and would like very much to publish it for\r\ngeneral circulation upon his own account, subject to a royalty.\r\n\r\nThe vain author is easily persuaded that what he has done is\r\nmeritorious, and I consented. [Every year this still nets me a small\r\nsum in royalties. And thirty years have gone by, 1912.] The letters I\r\nreceived upon the publication[37] of it were so numerous and some so\r\ngushing that my people saved them and they are now bound together in\r\nscrapbook form, to which additions are made from time to time. The\r\nnumber of invalids who have been pleased to write me, stating that the\r\nbook had brightened their lives, has been gratifying. Its reception in\r\nBritain was cordial; the \"Spectator\" gave it a favorable review. But\r\nany merit that the book has comes, I am sure, from the total absence\r\nof effort on my part to make an impression. I wrote for my friends;\r\nand what one does easily, one does well. I reveled in the writing of\r\nthe book, as I had in the journey itself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: Published privately in 1882 under the title _Our\r\nCoaching Trip, Brighton to Inverness_. Published by the Scribners in\r\n1883 under the title of _An American Four-in-Hand in Britain_.]\r\n\r\nThe year 1886 ended in deep gloom for me. My life as a happy careless\r\nyoung man, with every want looked after, was over. I was left alone in\r\nthe world. My mother and brother passed away in November, within a few\r\ndays of each other, while I lay in bed under a severe attack of\r\ntyphoid fever, unable to move and, perhaps fortunately, unable to\r\nfeel the full weight of the catastrophe, being myself face to face\r\nwith death.\r\n\r\nI was the first stricken, upon returning from a visit in the East to\r\nour cottage at Cresson Springs on top of the Alleghanies where my\r\nmother and I spent our happy summers. I had been quite unwell for a\r\nday or two before leaving New York. A physician being summoned, my\r\ntrouble was pronounced typhoid fever. Professor Dennis was called from\r\nNew York and he corroborated the diagnosis. An attendant physician and\r\ntrained nurse were provided at once. Soon after my mother broke down\r\nand my brother in Pittsburgh also was reported ill.\r\n\r\nI was despaired of, I was so low, and then my whole nature seemed to\r\nchange. I became reconciled, indulged in pleasing meditations, was\r\nwithout the slightest pain. My mother's and brother's serious\r\ncondition had not been revealed to me, and when I was informed that\r\nboth had left me forever it seemed only natural that I should follow\r\nthem. We had never been separated; why should we be now? But it was\r\ndecreed otherwise.\r\n\r\nI recovered slowly and the future began to occupy my thoughts. There\r\nwas only one ray of hope and comfort in it. Toward that my thoughts\r\nalways turned. For several years I had known Miss Louise Whitfield.\r\nHer mother permitted her to ride with me in the Central Park. We were\r\nboth very fond of riding. Other young ladies were on my list. I had\r\nfine horses and often rode in the Park and around New York with one or\r\nthe other of the circle. In the end the others all faded into ordinary\r\nbeings. Miss Whitfield remained alone as the perfect one beyond any I\r\nhad met. Finally I began to find and admit to myself that she stood\r\nthe supreme test I had applied to several fair ones in my time. She\r\nalone did so of all I had ever known. I could recommend young men to\r\napply this test before offering themselves. If they can honestly\r\nbelieve the following lines, as I did, then all is well:\r\n\r\n    \"Full many a lady\r\n    I've eyed with best regard: for several virtues\r\n    Have I liked several women, never any\r\n    With so full soul, but some defect in her\r\n    Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed,\r\n    And put it to the foil; but you, O you,\r\n    So perfect and so peerless are created\r\n    Of every creature's best.\"[38]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: Ferdinand to Miranda in _The Tempest_.]\r\n\r\nIn my soul I could echo those very words. To-day, after twenty years\r\nof life with her, if I could find stronger words I could truthfully\r\nuse them.\r\n\r\nMy advances met with indifferent success. She was not without other\r\nand younger admirers. My wealth and future plans were against me. I\r\nwas rich and had everything and she felt she could be of little use or\r\nbenefit to me. Her ideal was to be the real helpmeet of a young,\r\nstruggling man to whom she could and would be indispensable, as her\r\nmother had been to her father. The care of her own family had largely\r\nfallen upon her after her father's death when she was twenty-one. She\r\nwas now twenty-eight; her views of life were formed. At times she\r\nseemed more favorable and we corresponded. Once, however, she returned\r\nmy letters saying she felt she must put aside all thought of accepting\r\nme.\r\n\r\nProfessor and Mrs. Dennis took me from Cresson to their own home in\r\nNew York, as soon as I could be removed, and I lay there some time\r\nunder the former's personal supervision. Miss Whitfield called to see\r\nme, for I had written her the first words from Cresson I was able\r\nto write. She saw now that I needed her. I was left alone in the\r\nworld. Now she could be in every sense the \"helpmeet.\" Both her heart\r\nand head were now willing and the day was fixed. We were married in\r\nNew York April 22, 1887, and sailed for our honeymoon which was passed\r\non the Isle of Wight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANDREW CARNEGIE\r\n\r\n(ABOUT 1878)]\r\n\r\nHer delight was intense in finding the wild flowers. She had read of\r\nWandering Willie, Heartsease, Forget-me-nots, the Primrose, Wild\r\nThyme, and the whole list of homely names that had been to her only\r\nnames till now. Everything charmed her. Uncle Lauder and one of my\r\ncousins came down from Scotland and visited us, and then we soon\r\nfollowed to the residence at Kilgraston they had selected for us in\r\nwhich to spend the summer. Scotland captured her. There was no doubt\r\nabout that. Her girlish reading had been of Scotland--Scott's novels\r\nand \"Scottish Chiefs\" being her favorites. She soon became more Scotch\r\nthan I. All this was fulfilling my fondest dreams.\r\n\r\nWe spent some days in Dunfermline and enjoyed them much. The haunts\r\nand incidents of my boyhood were visited and recited to her by all and\r\nsundry. She got nothing but flattering accounts of her husband which\r\ngave me a good start with her.\r\n\r\nI was presented with the Freedom of Edinburgh as we passed\r\nnorthward--Lord Rosebery making the speech. The crowd in Edinburgh was\r\ngreat. I addressed the working-men in the largest hall and received a\r\npresent from them as did Mrs. Carnegie also--a brooch she values\r\nhighly. She heard and saw the pipers in all their glory and begged\r\nthere should be one at our home--a piper to walk around and waken us\r\nin the morning and also to play us in to dinner. American as she is to\r\nthe core, and Connecticut Puritan at that, she declared that if\r\ncondemned to live upon a lonely island and allowed to choose only one\r\nmusical instrument, it would be the pipes. The piper was secured\r\nquickly enough. One called and presented credentials from Cluny\r\nMcPherson. We engaged him and were preceded by him playing the pipes\r\nas we entered our Kilgraston house.\r\n\r\nWe enjoyed Kilgraston, although Mrs. Carnegie still longed for a\r\nwilder and more Highland home. Matthew Arnold visited us, as did Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Blaine, Senator and Mrs. Eugene Hale, and many friends.[39]\r\nMrs. Carnegie would have my relatives up from Dunfermline, especially\r\nthe older uncles and aunties. She charmed every one. They expressed\r\ntheir surprise to me that she ever married me, but I told them I was\r\nequally surprised. The match had evidently been predestined.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: John Hay, writing to his friend Henry Adams under date\r\nof London, August 25, 1887, has the following to say about the party\r\nat Kilgraston: \"After that we went to Andy Carnegie in Perthshire, who\r\nis keeping his honeymoon, having just married a pretty girl.... The\r\nhouse is thronged with visitors--sixteen when we came away--we merely\r\nstayed three days: the others were there for a fortnight. Among them\r\nwere your friends Blaine and Hale of Maine. Carnegie likes it so well\r\nhe is going to do it every summer and is looking at all the great\r\nestates in the County with a view of renting or purchasing. We went\r\nwith him one day to Dupplin Castle, where I saw the most beautiful\r\ntrees I ever beheld in my wandering life. The old Earl of ---- is\r\nmiserably poor--not able to buy a bottle of seltzer--with an estate\r\nworth millions in the hands of his creditors, and sure to be sold one\r\nof these days to some enterprising Yankee or British Buttonmaker. I\r\nwish you or Carnegie would buy it. I would visit you frequently.\"\r\n(Thayer, _Life and Letters of John Hay_, vol. II, p. 74.)]\r\n\r\nWe took our piper with us when we returned to New York, and also our\r\nhousekeeper and some of the servants. Mrs. Nicoll remains with us\r\nstill and is now, after twenty years' faithful service, as a member of\r\nthe family. George Irvine, our butler, came to us a year later and is\r\nalso as one of us. Maggie Anderson, one of the servants, is the same.\r\nThey are devoted people, of high character and true loyalty.[40]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: \"No man is a true gentleman who does not inspire the\r\naffection and devotion of his servants.\" (_Problems of To-day_, by\r\nAndrew Carnegie. New York, 1908, p. 59.)]\r\n\r\nThe next year we were offered and took Cluny Castle. Our piper was\r\njust the man to tell us all about it. He had been born and bred there\r\nand perhaps influenced our selection of that residence where we spent\r\nseveral summers.\r\n\r\nOn March 30, 1897, there came to us our daughter. As I first gazed\r\nupon her Mrs. Carnegie said,\r\n\r\n\"Her name is Margaret after your mother. Now one request I have to\r\nmake.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Lou?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must get a summer home since this little one has been given us. We\r\ncannot rent one and be obliged to go in and go out at a certain date.\r\nIt should be our home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I agreed.\r\n\r\n\"I make only one condition.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"It must be in the Highlands of Scotland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless you,\" was my reply. \"That suits me. You know I have to keep out\r\nof the sun's rays, and where can we do that so surely as among the\r\nheather? I'll be a committee of one to inquire and report.\"\r\n\r\nSkibo Castle was the result.\r\n\r\nIt is now twenty years since Mrs. Carnegie entered and changed my\r\nlife, a few months after the passing of my mother and only brother\r\nleft me alone in the world. My life has been made so happy by her that\r\nI cannot imagine myself living without her guardianship. I thought I\r\nknew her when she stood Ferdinand's test,[41] but it was only the\r\nsurface of her qualities I had seen and felt. Of their purity,\r\nholiness, wisdom, I had not sounded the depth. In every emergency of\r\nour active, changing, and in later years somewhat public life, in all\r\nher relations with others, including my family and her own, she has\r\nproved the diplomat and peace-maker. Peace and good-will attend her\r\nfootsteps wherever her blessed influence extends. In the rare\r\ninstances demanding heroic action it is she who first realizes this\r\nand plays the part.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: The reference is to the quotation from _The Tempest_ on\r\npage 214.]\r\n\r\nThe Peace-Maker has never had a quarrel in all her life, not even with\r\na schoolmate, and there does not live a soul upon the earth who has\r\nmet her who has the slightest cause to complain of neglect. Not that\r\nshe does not welcome the best and gently avoid the undesirable--none\r\nis more fastidious than she--but neither rank, wealth, nor social\r\nposition affects her one iota. She is incapable of acting or speaking\r\nrudely; all is in perfect good taste. Still, she never lowers the\r\nstandard. Her intimates are only of the best. She is always thinking\r\nhow she can do good to those around her--planning for this one and\r\nthat in case of need and making such judicious arrangements or\r\npresents as surprise those coöperating with her.\r\n\r\nI cannot imagine myself going through these twenty years without her.\r\nNor can I endure the thought of living after her. In the course of\r\nnature I have not that to meet; but then the thought of what will be\r\ncast upon her, a woman left alone with so much requiring attention and\r\nneeding a man to decide, gives me intense pain and I sometimes wish I\r\nhad this to endure for her. But then she will have our blessed\r\ndaughter in her life and perhaps that will keep her patient. Besides,\r\nMargaret needs her more than she does her father.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. ANDREW CARNEGIE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARGARET CARNEGIE AT FIFTEEN]\r\n\r\nWhy, oh, why, are we compelled to leave the heaven we have found on\r\nearth and go we know not where! For I can say with Jessica:\r\n\r\n            \"It is very meet\r\n    The Lord Bassanio live an upright life;\r\n    For, having such a blessing in his lady,\r\n    He finds the joys of heaven here on earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nMILLS AND THE MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe one vital lesson in iron and steel that I learned in Britain was\r\nthe necessity for owning raw materials and finishing the completed\r\narticle ready for its purpose. Having solved the steel-rail problem at\r\nthe Edgar Thomson Works, we soon proceeded to the next step. The\r\ndifficulties and uncertainties of obtaining regular supplies of pig\r\niron compelled us to begin the erection of blast furnaces. Three of\r\nthese were built, one, however, being a reconstructed blast furnace\r\npurchased from the Escanaba Iron Company, with which Mr. Kloman had\r\nbeen connected. As is usual in such cases, the furnace cost us as much\r\nas a new one, and it never was as good. There is nothing so\r\nunsatisfactory as purchases of inferior plants.\r\n\r\nBut although this purchase was a mistake, directly considered, it\r\nproved, at a subsequent date, a source of great profit because it gave\r\nus a furnace small enough for the manufacture of spiegel and, at a\r\nlater date, of ferro-manganese. We were the second firm in the United\r\nStates to manufacture our own spiegel, and the first, and for years\r\nthe only, firm in America that made ferro-manganese. We had been\r\ndependent upon foreigners for a supply of this indispensable article,\r\npaying as high as eighty dollars a ton for it. The manager of our\r\nblast furnaces, Mr. Julian Kennedy, is entitled to the credit of\r\nsuggesting that with the ores within reach we could make\r\nferro-manganese in our small furnace. The experiment was worth trying\r\nand the result was a great success. We were able to supply the entire\r\nAmerican demand and prices fell from eighty to fifty dollars per ton\r\nas a consequence.\r\n\r\nWhile testing the ores of Virginia we found that these were being\r\nquietly purchased by Europeans for ferro-manganese, the owners of the\r\nmine being led to believe that they were used for other purposes. Our\r\nMr. Phipps at once set about purchasing that mine. He obtained an\r\noption from the owners, who had neither capital nor skill to work it\r\nefficiently. A high price was paid to them for their interests, and\r\n(with one of them, Mr. Davis, a very able young man) we became the\r\nowners, but not until a thorough investigation of the mine had proved\r\nthat there was enough of manganese ore in sight to repay us. All this\r\nwas done with speed; not a day was lost when the discovery was made.\r\nAnd here lies the great advantage of a partnership over a corporation.\r\nThe president of the latter would have had to consult a board of\r\ndirectors and wait several weeks and perhaps months for their\r\ndecision. By that time the mine would probably have become the\r\nproperty of others.\r\n\r\nWe continued to develop our blast-furnace plant, every new one being a\r\ngreat improvement upon the preceding, until at last we thought we had\r\narrived at a standard furnace. Minor improvements would no doubt be\r\nmade, but so far as we could see we had a perfect plant and our\r\ncapacity was then fifty thousand tons per month of pig iron.\r\n\r\nThe blast-furnace department was no sooner added than another step was\r\nseen to be essential to our independence and success. The supply of\r\nsuperior coke was a fixed quantity--the Connellsville field being\r\ndefined. We found that we could not get on without a supply of the\r\nfuel essential to the smelting of pig iron; and a very thorough\r\ninvestigation of the question led us to the conclusion that the Frick\r\nCoke Company had not only the best coal and coke property, but that it\r\nhad in Mr. Frick himself a man with a positive genius for its\r\nmanagement. He had proved his ability by starting as a poor railway\r\nclerk and succeeding. In 1882 we purchased one half of the stock of\r\nthis company, and by subsequent purchases from other holders we became\r\nowners of the great bulk of the shares.\r\n\r\nThere now remained to be acquired only the supply of iron stone. If we\r\ncould obtain this we should be in the position occupied by only two or\r\nthree of the European concerns. We thought at one time we had\r\nsucceeded in discovering in Pennsylvania this last remaining link in\r\nthe chain. We were misled, however, in our investment in the Tyrone\r\nregion, and lost considerable sums as the result of our attempts to\r\nmine and use the ores of that section. They promised well at the edges\r\nof the mines, where the action of the weather for ages had washed away\r\nimpurities and enriched the ore, but when we penetrated a small\r\ndistance they proved too \"lean\" to work.\r\n\r\nOur chemist, Mr. Prousser, was then sent to a Pennsylvania furnace\r\namong the hills which we had leased, with instructions to analyze all\r\nthe materials brought to him from the district, and to encourage\r\npeople to bring him specimens of minerals. A striking example of the\r\nawe inspired by the chemist in those days was that only with great\r\ndifficulty could he obtain a man or a boy to assist him in the\r\nlaboratory. He was suspected of illicit intercourse with the Powers of\r\nEvil when he undertook to tell by his suspicious-looking apparatus\r\nwhat a stone contained. I believe that at last we had to send him a\r\nman from our office at Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nOne day he sent us a report of analyses of ore remarkable for the\r\nabsence of phosphorus. It was really an ore suitable for making\r\nBessemer steel. Such a discovery attracted our attention at once. The\r\nowner of the property was Moses Thompson, a rich farmer, proprietor of\r\nseven thousand acres of the most beautiful agricultural land in Center\r\nCounty, Pennsylvania. An appointment was made to meet him upon the\r\nground from which the ore had been obtained. We found the mine had\r\nbeen worked for a charcoal blast furnace fifty or sixty years before,\r\nbut it had not borne a good reputation then, the reason no doubt being\r\nthat its product was so much purer than other ores that the same\r\namount of flux used caused trouble in smelting. It was so good it was\r\ngood for nothing in those days of old.\r\n\r\nWe finally obtained the right to take the mine over at any time within\r\nsix months, and we therefore began the work of examination, which\r\nevery purchaser of mineral property should make most carefully. We ran\r\nlines across the hillside fifty feet apart, with cross-lines at\r\ndistances of a hundred feet apart, and at each point of intersection\r\nwe put a shaft down through the ore. I believe there were eighty such\r\nshafts in all and the ore was analyzed at every few feet of depth, so\r\nthat before we paid over the hundred thousand dollars asked we knew\r\nexactly what there was of ore. The result hoped for was more than\r\nrealized. Through the ability of my cousin and partner, Mr. Lauder,\r\nthe cost of mining and washing was reduced to a low figure, and the\r\nScotia ore made good all the losses we had incurred in the other\r\nmines, paid for itself, and left a profit besides. In this case, at\r\nleast, we snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. We trod upon sure\r\nground with the chemist as our guide. It will be seen that we were\r\ndetermined to get raw materials and were active in the pursuit.\r\n\r\nWe had lost and won, but the escapes in business affairs are sometimes\r\nvery narrow. Driving with Mr. Phipps from the mills one day we passed\r\nthe National Trust Company office on Penn Street, Pittsburgh. I\r\nnoticed the large gilt letters across the window, \"Stockholders\r\nindividually liable.\" That very morning in looking over a statement of\r\nour affairs I had noticed twenty shares \"National Trust Company\" on\r\nthe list of assets. I said to Harry:\r\n\r\n\"If this is the concern we own shares in, won't you please sell them\r\nbefore you return to the office this afternoon?\"\r\n\r\nHe saw no need for haste. It would be done in good time.\r\n\r\n\"No, Harry, oblige me by doing it instantly.\"\r\n\r\nHe did so and had it transferred. Fortunate, indeed, was this, for in\r\na short time the bank failed with an enormous deficit. My cousin, Mr.\r\nMorris, was among the ruined shareholders. Many others met the same\r\nfate. Times were panicky, and had we been individually liable for all\r\nthe debts of the National Trust Company our credit would inevitably\r\nhave been seriously imperiled. It was a narrow escape. And with only\r\ntwenty shares (two thousand dollars' worth of stock), taken to oblige\r\nfriends who wished our name on their list of shareholders! The lesson\r\nwas not lost. The sound rule in business is that you may give money\r\nfreely when you have a surplus, but your name never--neither as\r\nendorser nor as member of a corporation with individual liability. A\r\ntrifling investment of a few thousand dollars, a mere trifle--yes, but\r\na trifle possessed of deadly explosive power.\r\n\r\nThe rapid substitution of steel for iron in the immediate future had\r\nbecome obvious to us. Even in our Keystone Bridge Works, steel was\r\nbeing used more and more in place of iron. King Iron was about to be\r\ndeposed by the new King Steel, and we were becoming more and more\r\ndependent upon it. We had about concluded in 1886 to build alongside\r\nof the Edgar Thomson Mills new works for the manufacture of\r\nmiscellaneous shapes of steel when it was suggested to us that the\r\nfive or six leading manufacturers of Pittsburgh, who had combined to\r\nbuild steel mills at Homestead, were willing to sell their mills to\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThese works had been built originally by a syndicate of manufacturers,\r\nwith the view of obtaining the necessary supplies of steel which they\r\nrequired in their various concerns, but the steel-rail business, being\r\nthen in one of its booms, they had been tempted to change plans and\r\nconstruct a steel-rail mill. They had been able to make rails as long\r\nas prices remained high, but, as the mills had not been specially\r\ndesigned for this purpose, they were without the indispensable blast\r\nfurnaces for the supply of pig iron, and had no coke lands for the\r\nsupply of fuel. They were in no condition to compete with us.\r\n\r\nIt was advantageous for us to purchase these works. I felt there was\r\nonly one way we could deal with their owners, and that was to propose\r\na consolidation with Carnegie Brothers & Co. We offered to do so on\r\nequal terms, every dollar they had invested to rank against our\r\ndollars. Upon this basis the negotiation was promptly concluded. We,\r\nhowever, gave to all parties the option to take cash, and most\r\nfortunately for us, all elected to do so except Mr. George Singer, who\r\ncontinued with us to his and our entire satisfaction. Mr. Singer told\r\nus afterwards that his associates had been greatly exercised as to how\r\nthey could meet the proposition I was to lay before them. They were\r\nmuch afraid of being overreached but when I proposed equality all\r\naround, dollar for dollar, they were speechless.\r\n\r\nThis purchase led to the reconstruction of all our firms. The new firm\r\nof Carnegie, Phipps & Co. was organized in 1886 to run the Homestead\r\nMills. The firm of Wilson, Walker & Co. was embraced in the firm of\r\nCarnegie, Phipps & Co., Mr. Walker being elected chairman. My brother\r\nwas chairman of Carnegie Brothers & Co. and at the head of all. A\r\nfurther extension of our business was the establishing of the Hartman\r\nSteel Works at Beaver Falls, designed to work into a hundred various\r\nforms the product of the Homestead Mills. So now we made almost\r\neverything in steel from a wire nail up to a twenty-inch steel girder,\r\nand it was then not thought probable that we should enter into any new\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting here to note the progress of our works during\r\nthe decade 1888 to 1897. In 1888 we had twenty millions of dollars\r\ninvested; in 1897 more than double or over forty-five millions. The\r\n600,000 tons of pig iron we made per annum in 1888 was trebled; we\r\nmade nearly 2,000,000. Our product of iron and steel was in 1888, say,\r\n2000 tons per day; it grew to exceed 6000 tons. Our coke works then\r\nembraced about 5000 ovens; they were trebled in number, and our\r\ncapacity, then 6000 tons, became 18,000 tons per day. Our Frick Coke\r\nCompany in 1897 had 42,000 acres of coal land, more than two thirds of\r\nthe true Connellsville vein. Ten years hence increased production may\r\nbe found to have been equally rapid. It may be accepted as an axiom\r\nthat a manufacturing concern in a growing country like ours begins to\r\ndecay when it stops extending.\r\n\r\nTo make a ton of steel one and a half tons of iron stone has to be\r\nmined, transported by rail a hundred miles to the Lakes, carried by\r\nboat hundreds of miles, transferred to cars, transported by rail one\r\nhundred and fifty miles to Pittsburgh; one and a half tons of coal\r\nmust be mined and manufactured into coke and carried fifty-odd miles\r\nby rail; and one ton of limestone mined and carried one hundred and\r\nfifty miles to Pittsburgh. How then could steel be manufactured and\r\nsold without loss at three pounds for two cents? This, I confess,\r\nseemed to me incredible, and little less than miraculous, but it was\r\nso.\r\n\r\nAmerica is soon to change from being the dearest steel manufacturing\r\ncountry to the cheapest. Already the shipyards of Belfast are our\r\ncustomers. This is but the beginning. Under present conditions America\r\ncan produce steel as cheaply as any other land, notwithstanding its\r\nhigher-priced labor. There is no labor so cheap as the dearest in the\r\nmechanical field, provided it is free, contented, zealous, and reaping\r\nreward as it renders service. And here America leads.\r\n\r\nOne great advantage which America will have in competing in the\r\nmarkets of the world is that her manufacturers will have the best home\r\nmarket. Upon this they can depend for a return upon capital, and the\r\nsurplus product can be exported with advantage, even when the prices\r\nreceived for it do not more than cover actual cost, provided the\r\nexports be charged with their proportion of all expenses. The nation\r\nthat has the best home market, especially if products are\r\nstandardized, as ours are, can soon outsell the foreign producer. The\r\nphrase I used in Britain in this connection was: \"The Law of the\r\nSurplus.\" It afterward came into general use in commercial\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE HOMESTEAD STRIKE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile upon the subject of our manufacturing interests, I may record\r\nthat on July 1, 1892, during my absence in the Highlands of Scotland,\r\nthere occurred the one really serious quarrel with our workmen in our\r\nwhole history. For twenty-six years I had been actively in charge of\r\nthe relations between ourselves and our men, and it was the pride of\r\nmy life to think how delightfully satisfactory these had been and\r\nwere. I hope I fully deserved what my chief partner, Mr. Phipps, said\r\nin his letter to the \"New York Herald,\" January 30, 1904, in reply to\r\none who had declared I had remained abroad during the Homestead\r\nstrike, instead of flying back to support my partners. It was to the\r\neffect that \"I was always disposed to yield to the demands of the men,\r\nhowever unreasonable\"; hence one or two of my partners did not wish me\r\nto return.[42] Taking no account of the reward that comes from\r\nfeeling that you and your employees are friends and judging only from\r\neconomical results, I believe that higher wages to men who respect\r\ntheir employers and are happy and contented are a good investment,\r\nyielding, indeed, big dividends.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: The full statement of Mr. Phipps is as follows:\r\n\r\n_Question:_ \"It was stated that Mr. Carnegie acted in a cowardly\r\nmanner in not returning to America from Scotland and being present\r\nwhen the strike was in progress at Homestead.\"\r\n\r\n_Answer:_ \"When Mr. Carnegie heard of the trouble at Homestead he\r\nimmediately wired that he would take the first ship for America, but\r\nhis partners begged him not to appear, as they were of the opinion\r\nthat the welfare of the Company required that he should not be in this\r\ncountry at the time. They knew of his extreme disposition to always\r\ngrant the demands of labor, however unreasonable.\r\n\r\n\"I have never known of any one interested in the business to make any\r\ncomplaint about Mr. Carnegie's absence at that time, but all the\r\npartners rejoiced that they were permitted to manage the affair in\r\ntheir own way.\" (Henry Phipps in the _New York Herald_, January 30,\r\n1904.)]\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of steel was revolutionized by the Bessemer\r\nopen-hearth and basic inventions. The machinery hitherto employed had\r\nbecome obsolete, and our firm, recognizing this, spent several\r\nmillions at Homestead reconstructing and enlarging the works. The new\r\nmachinery made about sixty per cent more steel than the old. Two\r\nhundred and eighteen tonnage men (that is, men who were paid by the\r\nton of steel produced) were working under a three years' contract,\r\npart of the last year being with the new machinery. Thus their\r\nearnings had increased almost sixty per cent before the end of the\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\nThe firm offered to divide this sixty per cent with them in the new\r\nscale to be made thereafter. That is to say, the earnings of the men\r\nwould have been thirty per cent greater than under the old scale and\r\nthe other thirty per cent would have gone to the firm to recompense it\r\nfor its outlay. The work of the men would not have been much harder\r\nthan it had been hitherto, as the improved machinery did the work.\r\nThis was not only fair and liberal, it was generous, and under\r\nordinary circumstances would have been accepted by the men with\r\nthanks. But the firm was then engaged in making armor for the United\r\nStates Government, which we had declined twice to manufacture and\r\nwhich was urgently needed. It had also the contract to furnish\r\nmaterial for the Chicago Exhibition. Some of the leaders of the men,\r\nknowing these conditions, insisted upon demanding the whole sixty per\r\ncent, thinking the firm would be compelled to give it. The firm could\r\nnot agree, nor should it have agreed to such an attempt as this to\r\ntake it by the throat and say, \"Stand and deliver.\" It very rightly\r\ndeclined. Had I been at home nothing would have induced me to yield to\r\nthis unfair attempt to extort.\r\n\r\nUp to this point all had been right enough. The policy I had pursued\r\nin cases of difference with our men was that of patiently waiting,\r\nreasoning with them, and showing them that their demands were unfair;\r\nbut never attempting to employ new men in their places--never. The\r\nsuperintendent of Homestead, however, was assured by the three\r\nthousand men who were not concerned in the dispute that they could run\r\nthe works, and were anxious to rid themselves of the two hundred and\r\neighteen men who had banded themselves into a union and into which\r\nthey had hitherto refused to admit those in other departments--only\r\nthe \"heaters\" and \"rollers\" of steel being eligible.\r\n\r\nMy partners were misled by this superintendent, who was himself\r\nmisled. He had not had great experience in such affairs, having\r\nrecently been promoted from a subordinate position. The unjust demands\r\nof the few union men, and the opinion of the three thousand non-union\r\nmen that they were unjust, very naturally led him into thinking there\r\nwould be no trouble and that the workmen would do as they had\r\npromised. There were many men among the three thousand who could take,\r\nand wished to take, the places of the two hundred and eighteen--at\r\nleast so it was reported to me.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to look back and say that the vital step of opening the\r\nworks should never have been taken. All the firm had to do was to say\r\nto the men: \"There is a labor dispute here and you must settle it\r\nbetween yourselves. The firm has made you a most liberal offer. The\r\nworks will run when the dispute is adjusted, and not till then.\r\nMeanwhile your places remain open to you.\" Or, it might have been well\r\nif the superintendent had said to the three thousand men, \"All right,\r\nif you will come and run the works without protection,\" thus throwing\r\nupon them the responsibility of protecting themselves--three thousand\r\nmen as against two hundred and eighteen. Instead of this it was\r\nthought advisable (as an additional precaution by the state officials,\r\nI understand) to have the sheriff with guards to protect the thousands\r\nagainst the hundreds. The leaders of the latter were violent and\r\naggressive men; they had guns and pistols, and, as was soon proved,\r\nwere able to intimidate the thousands.\r\n\r\nI quote what I once laid down in writing as our rule: \"My idea is that\r\nthe Company should be known as determined to let the men at any works\r\nstop work; that it will confer freely with them and wait patiently\r\nuntil they decide to return to work, never thinking of trying new\r\nmen--never.\" The best men as men, and the best workmen, are not\r\nwalking the streets looking for work. Only the inferior class as a\r\nrule is idle. The kind of men we desired are rarely allowed to lose\r\ntheir jobs, even in dull times. It is impossible to get new men to run\r\nsuccessfully the complicated machinery of a modern steel plant. The\r\nattempt to put in new men converted the thousands of old men who\r\ndesired to work, into lukewarm supporters of our policy, for workmen\r\ncan always be relied upon to resent the employment of new men. Who can\r\nblame them?\r\n\r\nIf I had been at home, however, I might have been persuaded to open\r\nthe works, as the superintendent desired, to test whether our old men\r\nwould go to work as they had promised. But it should be noted that\r\nthe works were not opened at first by my partners for new men. On the\r\ncontrary, it was, as I was informed upon my return, at the wish of the\r\nthousands of our old men that they were opened. This is a vital point.\r\nMy partners were in no way blamable for making the trial so\r\nrecommended by the superintendent. Our rule never to employ new men,\r\nbut to wait for the old to return, had not been violated so far. In\r\nregard to the second opening of the works, after the strikers had shot\r\nthe sheriff's officers, it is also easy to look back and say, \"How\r\nmuch better had the works been closed until the old men voted to\r\nreturn\"; but the Governor of Pennsylvania, with eight thousand troops,\r\nhad meanwhile taken charge of the situation.\r\n\r\nI was traveling in the Highlands of Scotland when the trouble arose,\r\nand did not hear of it until two days after. Nothing I have ever had\r\nto meet in all my life, before or since, wounded me so deeply. No\r\npangs remain of any wound received in my business career save that of\r\nHomestead. It was so unnecessary. The men were outrageously wrong. The\r\nstrikers, with the new machinery, would have made from four to nine\r\ndollars a day under the new scale--thirty per cent more than they were\r\nmaking with the old machinery. While in Scotland I received the\r\nfollowing cable from the officers of the union of our workmen:\r\n\r\n\"Kind master, tell us what you wish us to do and we shall do it for\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThis was most touching, but, alas, too late. The mischief was done,\r\nthe works were in the hands of the Governor; it was too late.\r\n\r\nI received, while abroad, numerous kind messages from friends\r\nconversant with the circumstances, who imagined my unhappiness. The\r\nfollowing from Mr. Gladstone was greatly appreciated:\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MR. CARNEGIE,\r\n\r\n     My wife has long ago offered her thanks, with my own, for\r\n     your most kind congratulations. But I do not forget that you\r\n     have been suffering yourself from anxieties, and have been\r\n     exposed to imputations in connection with your gallant\r\n     efforts to direct rich men into a course of action more\r\n     enlightened than that which they usually follow. I wish I\r\n     could relieve you from these imputations of journalists, too\r\n     often rash, conceited or censorious, rancorous, ill-natured.\r\n     I wish to do the little, the very little, that is in my\r\n     power, which is simply to say how sure I am that no one who\r\n     knows you will be prompted by the unfortunate occurrences\r\n     across the water (of which manifestly we cannot know the\r\n     exact merits) to qualify in the slightest degree either his\r\n     confidence in your generous views or his admiration of the\r\n     good and great work you have already done.\r\n\r\n     Wealth is at present like a monster threatening to swallow\r\n     up the moral life of man; you by precept and by example have\r\n     been teaching him to disgorge. I for one thank you.\r\n\r\n     Believe me\r\n\r\n     Very faithfully yours\r\n\r\n     (Signed) W.E. GLADSTONE\r\n\r\nI insert this as giving proof, if proof were needed, of Mr.\r\nGladstone's large, sympathetic nature, alive and sensitive to\r\neverything transpiring of a nature to arouse sympathy--Neapolitans,\r\nGreeks, and Bulgarians one day, or a stricken friend the next.\r\n\r\nThe general public, of course, did not know that I was in Scotland and\r\nknew nothing of the initial trouble at Homestead. Workmen had been\r\nkilled at the Carnegie Works, of which I was the controlling owner.\r\nThat was sufficient to make my name a by-word for years. But at last\r\nsome satisfaction came. Senator Hanna was president of the National\r\nCivic Federation, a body composed of capitalists and workmen which\r\nexerted a benign influence over both employers and employed, and the\r\nHonorable Oscar Straus, who was then vice-president, invited me to\r\ndine at his house and meet the officials of the Federation. Before the\r\ndate appointed Mark Hanna, its president, my lifelong friend and\r\nformer agent at Cleveland, had suddenly passed away. I attended the\r\ndinner. At its close Mr. Straus arose and said that the question of a\r\nsuccessor to Mr. Hanna had been considered, and he had to report that\r\nevery labor organization heard from had favored me for the position.\r\nThere were present several of the labor leaders who, one after\r\nanother, arose and corroborated Mr. Straus.\r\n\r\nI do not remember so complete a surprise and, I shall confess, one so\r\ngrateful to me. That I deserved well from labor I felt. I knew myself\r\nto be warmly sympathetic with the working-man, and also that I had the\r\nregard of our own workmen; but throughout the country it was naturally\r\nthe reverse, owing to the Homestead riot. The Carnegie Works meant to\r\nthe public Mr. Carnegie's war upon labor's just earnings.\r\n\r\nI arose to explain to the officials at the Straus dinner that I could\r\nnot possibly accept the great honor, because I had to escape the heat\r\nof summer and the head of the Federation must be on hand at all\r\nseasons ready to grapple with an outbreak, should one occur. My\r\nembarrassment was great, but I managed to let all understand that this\r\nwas felt to be the most welcome tribute I could have received--a balm\r\nto the hurt mind. I closed by saying that if elected to my lamented\r\nfriend's place upon the Executive Committee I should esteem it an\r\nhonor to serve. To this position I was elected by unanimous vote. I\r\nwas thus relieved from the feeling that I was considered responsible\r\nby labor generally, for the Homestead riot and the killing of workmen.\r\n\r\nI owe this vindication to Mr. Oscar Straus, who had read my articles\r\nand speeches of early days upon labor questions, and who had quoted\r\nthese frequently to workmen. The two labor leaders of the Amalgamated\r\nUnion, White and Schaeffer from Pittsburgh, who were at this dinner,\r\nwere also able and anxious to enlighten their fellow-workmen members\r\nof the Board as to my record with labor, and did not fail to do so.\r\n\r\nA mass meeting of the workmen and their wives was afterwards held in\r\nthe Library Hall at Pittsburgh to greet me, and I addressed them from\r\nboth my head and my heart. The one sentence I remember, and always\r\nshall, was to the effect that capital, labor, and employer were a\r\nthree-legged stool, none before or after the others, all equally\r\nindispensable. Then came the cordial hand-shaking and all was well.\r\nHaving thus rejoined hands and hearts with our employees and their\r\nwives, I felt that a great weight had been effectually lifted, but I\r\nhad had a terrible experience although thousands of miles from the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nAn incident flowing from the Homestead trouble is told by my friend,\r\nProfessor John C. Van Dyke, of Rutgers College.\r\n\r\n     In the spring of 1900, I went up from Guaymas, on the Gulf\r\n     of California, to the ranch of a friend at La Noria Verde,\r\n     thinking to have a week's shooting in the mountains of\r\n     Sonora. The ranch was far enough removed from civilization,\r\n     and I had expected meeting there only a few Mexicans and\r\n     many Yaqui Indians, but much to my surprise I found an\r\n     English-speaking man, who proved to be an American. I did\r\n     not have long to wait in order to find out what brought him\r\n     there, for he was very lonesome and disposed to talk. His\r\n     name was McLuckie, and up to 1892 he had been a skilled\r\n     mechanic in the employ of the Carnegie Steel Works at\r\n     Homestead. He was what was called a \"top hand,\" received\r\n     large wages, was married, and at that time had a home and\r\n     considerable property. In addition, he had been honored by\r\n     his fellow-townsmen and had been made burgomaster of\r\n     Homestead.\r\n\r\n     When the strike of 1892 came McLuckie naturally sided with\r\n     the strikers, and in his capacity as burgomaster gave the\r\n     order to arrest the Pinkerton detectives who had come to\r\n     Homestead by steamer to protect the works and preserve\r\n     order. He believed he was fully justified in doing this. As\r\n     he explained it to me, the detectives were an armed force\r\n     invading his bailiwick, and he had a right to arrest and\r\n     disarm them. The order led to bloodshed, and the conflict\r\n     was begun in real earnest.\r\n\r\n     The story of the strike is, of course, well known to all.\r\n     The strikers were finally defeated. As for McLuckie, he was\r\n     indicted for murder, riot, treason, and I know not what\r\n     other offenses. He was compelled to flee from the State, was\r\n     wounded, starved, pursued by the officers of the law, and\r\n     obliged to go into hiding until the storm blew over. Then he\r\n     found that he was blacklisted by all the steel men in the\r\n     United States and could not get employment anywhere. His\r\n     money was gone, and, as a final blow, his wife died and his\r\n     home was broken up. After many vicissitudes he resolved to\r\n     go to Mexico, and at the time I met him he was trying to get\r\n     employment in the mines about fifteen miles from La Noria\r\n     Verde. But he was too good a mechanic for the Mexicans, who\r\n     required in mining the cheapest kind of unskilled peon\r\n     labor. He could get nothing to do and had no money. He was\r\n     literally down to his last copper. Naturally, as he told the\r\n     story of his misfortunes, I felt very sorry for him,\r\n     especially as he was a most intelligent person and did no\r\n     unnecessary whining about his troubles.\r\n\r\n     I do not think I told him at the time that I knew Mr.\r\n     Carnegie and had been with him at Cluny in Scotland shortly\r\n     after the Homestead strike, nor that I knew from Mr.\r\n     Carnegie the other side of the story. But McLuckie was\r\n     rather careful not to blame Mr. Carnegie, saying to me\r\n     several times that if \"Andy\" had been there the trouble\r\n     would never have arisen. He seemed to think \"the boys\"\r\n     could get on very well with \"Andy\" but not so well with some\r\n     of his partners.\r\n\r\n     I was at the ranch for a week and saw a good deal of\r\n     McLuckie in the evenings. When I left there, I went directly\r\n     to Tucson, Arizona, and from there I had occasion to write\r\n     to Mr. Carnegie, and in the letter I told him about meeting\r\n     with McLuckie. I added that I felt very sorry for the man\r\n     and thought he had been treated rather badly. Mr. Carnegie\r\n     answered at once, and on the margin of the letter wrote in\r\n     lead pencil: \"Give McLuckie all the money he wants, but\r\n     don't mention my name.\" I wrote to McLuckie immediately,\r\n     offering him what money he needed, mentioning no sum, but\r\n     giving him to understand that it would be sufficient to put\r\n     him on his feet again. He declined it. He said he would\r\n     fight it out and make his own way, which was the\r\n     right-enough American spirit. I could not help but admire it\r\n     in him.\r\n\r\n     As I remember now, I spoke about him later to a friend, Mr.\r\n     J.A. Naugle, the general manager of the Sonora Railway. At\r\n     any rate, McLuckie got a job with the railway at driving\r\n     wells, and made a great success of it. A year later, or\r\n     perhaps it was in the autumn of the same year, I again met\r\n     him at Guaymas, where he was superintending some repairs on\r\n     his machinery at the railway shops. He was much changed for\r\n     the better, seemed happy, and to add to his contentment, had\r\n     taken unto himself a Mexican wife. And now that his sky was\r\n     cleared, I was anxious to tell him the truth about my offer\r\n     that he might not think unjustly of those who had been\r\n     compelled to fight him. So before I left him, I said,\r\n\r\n     \"McLuckie, I want you to know now that the money I offered\r\n     you was not mine. That was Andrew Carnegie's money. It was\r\n     his offer, made through me.\"\r\n\r\n     McLuckie was fairly stunned, and all he could say was:\r\n\r\n     \"Well, that was damned white of Andy, wasn't it?\"\r\n\r\nI would rather risk that verdict of McLuckie's as a passport to\r\nParadise than all the theological dogmas invented by man. I knew\r\nMcLuckie well as a good fellow. It was said his property in Homestead\r\nwas worth thirty thousand dollars. He was under arrest for the\r\nshooting of the police officers because he was the burgomaster, and\r\nalso the chairman of the Men's Committee of Homestead. He had to fly,\r\nleaving all behind him.\r\n\r\nAfter this story got into print, the following skit appeared in the\r\nnewspapers because I had declared I'd rather have McLuckie's few words\r\non my tombstone than any other inscription, for it indicated I had\r\nbeen kind to one of our workmen:\r\n\r\n\"JUST BY THE WAY\"\r\n\r\nSANDY ON ANDY\r\n\r\nOh! hae ye heared what Andy's spiered to hae upo' his tomb,\r\nWhen a' his gowd is gie'n awa an' Death has sealed his doom!\r\nNae Scriptur' line wi' tribute fine that dealers aye keep handy,\r\nBut juist this irreleegious screed--\"That's damned white of Andy!\"\r\n\r\nThe gude Scot laughs at epitaphs that are but meant to flatter,\r\nBut never are was sae profane, an' that's nae laughin' matter.\r\nYet, gin he gies his siller all awa, mon, he's a dandy,\r\nAn' we'll admit his right to it, for \"That's damned white of Andy!\"\r\n\r\nThere's not to be a \"big, big D,\" an' then a dash thereafter,\r\nFor Andy would na spoil the word by trying to make it safter;\r\nHe's not the lad to juggle terms, or soothing speech to bandy.\r\nA blunt, straightforward mon is he--an' \"That's damned white of Andy!\"\r\n\r\nSae when he's deid, we'll gie good heed, an' write it as he askit;\r\nWe'll carve it on his headstone an' we'll stamp it on his casket:\r\n\"Wha dees rich, dees disgraced,\" says he, an' sure's my name is Sandy,\r\n'T wull be nae rich man that he'll dee--an' \"That's damned white\r\n  of Andy!\"[43]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: Mr. Carnegie was very fond of this story because, being\r\nhuman, he was fond of applause and, being a Robert Burns radical, he\r\npreferred the applause of Labor to that of Rank. That one of his men\r\nthought he had acted \"white\" pleased him beyond measure. He stopped\r\nshort with that tribute and never asked, never knew, why or how the\r\nstory happened to be told. Perhaps this is the time and place to tell\r\nthe story of the story.\r\n\r\nSometime in 1901 over a dinner table in New York, I heard a statement\r\nregarding Mr. Carnegie that he never gave anything without the\r\nrequirement that his name be attached to the gift. The remark came\r\nfrom a prominent man who should have known he was talking nonsense. It\r\nrather angered me. I denied the statement, saying that I, personally,\r\nhad given away money for Mr. Carnegie that only he and I knew about,\r\nand that he had given many thousands in this way through others. By\r\nway of illustration I told the story about McLuckie. A Pittsburgh man\r\nat the table carried the story back to Pittsburgh, told it there, and\r\nit finally got into the newspapers. Of course the argument of the\r\nstory, namely, that Mr. Carnegie sometimes gave without publicity, was\r\nlost sight of and only the refrain, \"It was damned white of Andy,\"\r\nremained. Mr. Carnegie never knew that there was an argument. He liked\r\nthe refrain. Some years afterward at Skibo (1906), when he was writing\r\nthis Autobiography, he asked me if I would not write out the story for\r\nhim. I did so. I am now glad of the chance to write an explanatory\r\nnote about it.... _John C. Van Dyke._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nPROBLEMS OF LABOR\r\n\r\n\r\nI should like to record here some of the labor disputes I have had to\r\ndeal with, as these may point a moral to both capital and labor.\r\n\r\nThe workers at the blast furnaces in our steel-rail works once sent in\r\na \"round-robin\" stating that unless the firm gave them an advance of\r\nwages by Monday afternoon at four o'clock they would leave the\r\nfurnaces. Now, the scale upon which these men had agreed to work did\r\nnot lapse until the end of the year, several months off. I felt if men\r\nwould break an agreement there was no use in making a second agreement\r\nwith them, but nevertheless I took the night train from New York and\r\nwas at the works early in the morning.\r\n\r\nI asked the superintendent to call together the three committees which\r\ngoverned the works--not only the blast-furnace committee that was\r\nalone involved, but the mill and the converting works committees as\r\nwell. They appeared and, of course, were received by me with great\r\ncourtesy, not because it was good policy to be courteous, but because\r\nI have always enjoyed meeting our men. I am bound to say that the more\r\nI know of working-men the higher I rate their virtues. But it is with\r\nthem as Barrie says with women: \"Dootless the Lord made a' things\r\nweel, but he left some michty queer kinks in women.\" They have their\r\nprejudices and \"red rags,\" which have to be respected, for the main\r\nroot of trouble is ignorance, not hostility. The committee sat in a\r\nsemicircle before me, all with their hats off, of course, as mine\r\nwas also; and really there was the appearance of a model assembly.\r\n\r\nAddressing the chairman of the mill committee, I said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Mackay\" (he was an old gentleman and wore spectacles), \"have we\r\nan agreement with you covering the remainder of the year?\"\r\n\r\nTaking the spectacles off slowly, and holding them in his hand, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, you have, Mr. Carnegie, and you haven't got enough money to\r\nmake us break it either.\"\r\n\r\n\"There spoke the true American workman,\" I said. \"I am proud of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Johnson\" (who was chairman of the rail converters' committee),\r\n\"have we a similar agreement with you?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson was a small, spare man; he spoke very deliberately:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Carnegie, when an agreement is presented to me to sign, I read it\r\ncarefully, and if it don't suit me, I don't sign it, and if it does\r\nsuit me, I do sign it, and when I sign it I keep it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There again speaks the self-respecting American workman,\" I said.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the chairman of the blast-furnaces committee, an\r\nIrishman named Kelly, I addressed the same question to him:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Kelly, have we an agreement with you covering the remainder of\r\nthis year?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly answered that he couldn't say exactly. There was a paper\r\nsent round and he signed it, but didn't read it over carefully, and\r\ndidn't understand just what was in it. At this moment our\r\nsuperintendent, Captain Jones, excellent manager, but impulsive,\r\nexclaimed abruptly:\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Kelly, you know I read that over twice and discussed it with\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\n\"Order, order, Captain! Mr. Kelly is entitled to give his explanation.\r\nI sign many a paper that I do not read--documents our lawyers and\r\npartners present to me to sign. Mr. Kelly states that he signed this\r\ndocument under such circumstances and his statement must be received.\r\nBut, Mr. Kelly, I have always found that the best way is to carry out\r\nthe provisions of the agreement one signs carelessly and resolve to be\r\nmore careful next time. Would it not be better for you to continue\r\nfour months longer under this agreement, and then, when you sign the\r\nnext one, see that you understand it?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer to this, and I arose and said:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen of the Blast-Furnace Committee, you have threatened our\r\nfirm that you will break your agreement and that you will leave these\r\nblast furnaces (which means disaster) unless you get a favorable\r\nanswer to your threat by four o'clock to-day. It is not yet three, but\r\nyour answer is ready. You may leave the blast furnaces. The grass will\r\ngrow around them before we yield to your threat. The worst day that\r\nlabor has ever seen in this world is that day in which it dishonors\r\nitself by breaking its agreement. You have your answer.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee filed out slowly and there was silence among the\r\npartners. A stranger who was coming in on business met the committee\r\nin the passage and he reported:\r\n\r\n\"As I came in, a man wearing spectacles pushed up alongside of an\r\nIrishman he called Kelly, and he said: 'You fellows might just as well\r\nunderstand it now as later. There's to be no d----d monkeying round\r\nthese works.'\"\r\n\r\nThat meant business. Later we heard from one of our clerks what took\r\nplace at the furnaces. Kelly and his committee marched down to them.\r\nOf course, the men were waiting and watching for the committee and a\r\ncrowd had gathered. When the furnaces were reached, Kelly called out\r\nto them:\r\n\r\n\"Get to work, you spalpeens, what are you doing here? Begorra, the\r\nlittle boss just hit from the shoulder. He won't fight, but he says he\r\nhas sat down, and begorra, we all know he'll be a skeleton afore he\r\nrises. Get to work, ye spalpeens.\"\r\n\r\nThe Irish and Scotch-Irish are queer, but the easiest and best fellows\r\nto get on with, if you only know how. That man Kelly was my stanch\r\nfriend and admirer ever afterward, and he was before that one of our\r\nmost violent men. My experience is that you can always rely upon the\r\ngreat body of working-men to do what is right, provided they have not\r\ntaken up a position and promised their leaders to stand by them. But\r\ntheir loyalty to their leaders even when mistaken, is something to\r\nmake us proud of them. Anything can be done with men who have this\r\nfeeling of loyalty within them. They only need to be treated fairly.\r\n\r\nThe way a strike was once broken at our steel-rail mills is\r\ninteresting. Here again, I am sorry to say, one hundred and\r\nthirty-four men in one department had bound themselves under secret\r\noath to demand increased wages at the end of the year, several months\r\naway. The new year proved very unfavorable for business, and other\r\niron and steel manufacturers throughout the country had effected\r\nreductions in wages. Nevertheless, these men, having secretly sworn\r\nmonths previously that they would not work unless they got increased\r\nwages, thought themselves bound to insist upon their demands. We could\r\nnot advance wages when our competitors were reducing them, and the\r\nworks were stopped in consequence. Every department of the works was\r\nbrought to a stand by these strikers. The blast furnaces were\r\nabandoned a day or two before the time agreed upon, and we were\r\ngreatly troubled in consequence.\r\n\r\nI went to Pittsburgh and was surprised to find the furnaces had been\r\nbanked, contrary to agreement. I was to meet the men in the morning\r\nupon arrival at Pittsburgh, but a message was sent to me from the\r\nworks stating that the men had \"left the furnaces and would meet me\r\nto-morrow.\" Here was a nice reception! My reply was:\r\n\r\n\"No they won't. Tell them I shall not be here to-morrow. Anybody can\r\nstop work; the trick is to start it again. Some fine day these men\r\nwill want the works started and will be looking around for somebody\r\nwho can start them, and I will tell them then just what I do now: that\r\nthe works will never start except upon a sliding scale based upon the\r\nprices we get for our products. That scale will last three years and\r\nit will not be submitted by the men. They have submitted many scales\r\nto us. It is our turn now, and we are going to submit a scale to them.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" I said to my partners, \"I am going back to New York in the\r\nafternoon. Nothing more is to be done.\"\r\n\r\nA short time after my message was received by the men they asked if\r\nthey could come in and see me that afternoon before I left.\r\n\r\nI answered: \"Certainly!\"\r\n\r\nThey came in and I said to them:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, your chairman here, Mr. Bennett, assured you that I would\r\nmake my appearance and settle with you in some way or other, as I\r\nalways have settled. That is true. And he told you that I would not\r\nfight, which is also true. He is a true prophet. But he told you\r\nsomething else in which he was slightly mistaken. He said I _could_\r\nnot fight. Gentlemen,\" looking Mr. Bennett straight in the eye and\r\nclosing and raising my fist, \"he forgot that I was Scotch. But I will\r\ntell you something; I will never fight you. I know better than to\r\nfight labor. I will not fight, but I can beat any committee that was\r\never made at sitting down, and I have sat down. These works will never\r\nstart until the men vote by a two-thirds majority to start them, and\r\nthen, as I told you this morning, they will start on our sliding\r\nscale. I have nothing more to say.\"\r\n\r\nThey retired. It was about two weeks afterwards that one of the house\r\nservants came to my library in New York with a card, and I found upon\r\nit the names of two of our workmen, and also the name of a reverend\r\ngentleman. The men said they were from the works at Pittsburgh and\r\nwould like to see me.\r\n\r\n\"Ask if either of these gentlemen belongs to the blast-furnace workers\r\nwho banked the furnaces contrary to agreement.\"\r\n\r\nThe man returned and said \"No.\" I replied: \"In that case go down and\r\ntell them that I shall be pleased to have them come up.\"\r\n\r\nOf course they were received with genuine warmth and cordiality and we\r\nsat and talked about New York, for some time, this being their first\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Carnegie, we really came to talk about the trouble at the works,\"\r\nthe minister said at last.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, indeed!\" I answered. \"Have the men voted?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said.\r\n\r\nMy rejoinder was:\r\n\r\n\"You will have to excuse me from entering upon that subject; I said I\r\nnever would discuss it until they voted by a two-thirds majority to\r\nstart the mills. Gentlemen, you have never seen New York. Let me take\r\nyou out and show you Fifth Avenue and the Park, and we shall come back\r\nhere to lunch at half-past one.\"\r\n\r\nThis we did, talking about everything except the one thing that they\r\nwished to talk about. We had a good time, and I know they enjoyed\r\ntheir lunch. There is one great difference between the American\r\nworking-man and the foreigner. The American is a man; he sits down at\r\nlunch with people as if he were (as he generally is) a gentleman born.\r\nIt is splendid.\r\n\r\nThey returned to Pittsburgh, not another word having been said about\r\nthe works. But the men soon voted (there were very few votes against\r\nstarting) and I went again to Pittsburgh. I laid before the committee\r\nthe scale under which they were to work. It was a sliding scale based\r\non the price of the product. Such a scale really makes capital and\r\nlabor partners, sharing prosperous and disastrous times together. Of\r\ncourse it has a minimum, so that the men are always sure of living\r\nwages. As the men had seen these scales, it was unnecessary to go over\r\nthem. The chairman said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Carnegie, we will agree to everything. And now,\" he said\r\nhesitatingly, \"we have one favor to ask of you, and we hope you will\r\nnot refuse it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, gentlemen, if it be reasonable I shall surely grant it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is this: That you permit the officers of the union to sign\r\nthese papers for the men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, certainly, gentlemen! With the greatest pleasure! And then I\r\nhave a small favor to ask of you, which I hope you will not refuse, as\r\nI have granted yours. Just to please me, after the officers have\r\nsigned, let every workman sign also for himself. You see, Mr.\r\nBennett, this scale lasts for three years, and some man, or body of\r\nmen, might dispute whether your president of the union had authority\r\nto bind them for so long, but if we have his signature also, there\r\ncannot be any misunderstanding.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause; then one man at his side whispered to Mr. Bennett\r\n(but I heard him perfectly):\r\n\r\n\"By golly, the jig's up!\"\r\n\r\nSo it was, but it was not by direct attack, but by a flank movement.\r\nHad I not allowed the union officers to sign, they would have had a\r\ngrievance and an excuse for war. As it was, having allowed them to do\r\nso, how could they refuse so simple a request as mine, that each free\r\nand independent American citizen should also sign for himself. My\r\nrecollection is that as a matter of fact the officers of the union\r\nnever signed, but they may have done so. Why should they, if every\r\nman's signature was required? Besides this, the workmen, knowing that\r\nthe union could do nothing for them when the scale was adopted,\r\nneglected to pay dues and the union was deserted. We never heard of it\r\nagain. [That was in 1889, now twenty-seven years ago. The scale has\r\nnever been changed. The men would not change it if they could; it\r\nworks for their benefit, as I told them it would.]\r\n\r\nOf all my services rendered to labor the introduction of the sliding\r\nscale is chief. It is the solution of the capital and labor problem,\r\nbecause it really makes them partners--alike in prosperity and\r\nadversity. There was a yearly scale in operation in the Pittsburgh\r\ndistrict in the early years, but it is not a good plan because men and\r\nemployers at once begin preparing for a struggle which is almost\r\ncertain to come. It is far better for both employers and employed to\r\nset no date for an agreed-upon scale to end. It should be subject to\r\nsix months' or a year's notice on either side, and in that way might\r\nand probably would run on for years.\r\n\r\nTo show upon what trifles a contest between capital and labor may\r\nturn, let me tell of two instances which were amicably settled by mere\r\nincidents of seemingly little consequence. Once when I went out to\r\nmeet a men's committee, which had in our opinion made unfair demands,\r\nI was informed that they were influenced by a man who secretly owned a\r\ndrinking saloon, although working in the mills. He was a great bully.\r\nThe sober, quiet workmen were afraid of him, and the drinking men were\r\nhis debtors. He was the real instigator of the movement.\r\n\r\nWe met in the usual friendly fashion. I was glad to see the men, many\r\nof whom I had long known and could call by name. When we sat down at\r\nthe table the leader's seat was at one end and mine at the other. We\r\ntherefore faced each other. After I had laid our proposition before\r\nthe meeting, I saw the leader pick up his hat from the floor and\r\nslowly put it on his head, intimating that he was about to depart.\r\nHere was my chance.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, you are in the presence of gentlemen! Please be so good as to\r\ntake your hat off or leave the room!\"\r\n\r\nMy eyes were kept full upon him. There was a silence that could be\r\nfelt. The great bully hesitated, but I knew whatever he did, he was\r\nbeaten. If he left it was because he had treated the meeting\r\ndiscourteously by keeping his hat on, he was no gentleman; if he\r\nremained and took off his hat, he had been crushed by the rebuke. I\r\ndidn't care which course he took. He had only two and either of them\r\nwas fatal. He had delivered himself into my hands. He very slowly took\r\noff the hat and put it on the floor. Not a word did he speak\r\nthereafter in that conference. I was told afterward that he had to\r\nleave the place. The men rejoiced in the episode and a settlement was\r\nharmoniously effected.\r\n\r\nWhen the three years' scale was proposed to the men, a committee of\r\nsixteen was chosen by them to confer with us. Little progress was made\r\nat first, and I announced my engagements compelled me to return the\r\nnext day to New York. Inquiry was made as to whether we would meet a\r\ncommittee of thirty-two, as the men wished others added to the\r\ncommittee--a sure sign of division in their ranks. Of course we\r\nagreed. The committee came from the works to meet me at the office in\r\nPittsburgh. The proceedings were opened by one of our best men, Billy\r\nEdwards (I remember him well; he rose to high position afterwards),\r\nwho thought that the total offered was fair, but that the scale was\r\nnot equable. Some departments were all right, others were not fairly\r\ndealt with. Most of the men were naturally of this opinion, but when\r\nthey came to indicate the underpaid, there was a difference, as was to\r\nbe expected. No two men in the different departments could agree.\r\nBilly began:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Carnegie, we agree that the total sum per ton to be paid is fair,\r\nbut we think it is not properly distributed among us. Now, Mr.\r\nCarnegie, you take my job--\"\r\n\r\n\"Order, order!\" I cried. \"None of that, Billy. Mr. Carnegie 'takes no\r\nman's job.' Taking another's job is an unpardonable offense among\r\nhigh-classed workmen.\"\r\n\r\nThere was loud laughter, followed by applause, and then more laughter.\r\nI laughed with them. We had scored on Billy. Of course the dispute was\r\nsoon settled. It is not solely, often it is not chiefly, a matter of\r\ndollars with workmen. Appreciation, kind treatment, a fair\r\ndeal--these are often the potent forces with the American workmen.\r\n\r\nEmployers can do so many desirable things for their men at little\r\ncost. At one meeting when I asked what we could do for them, I\r\nremember this same Billy Edwards rose and said that most of the men\r\nhad to run in debt to the storekeepers because they were paid monthly.\r\nWell I remember his words:\r\n\r\n\"I have a good woman for wife who manages well. We go into Pittsburgh\r\nevery fourth Saturday afternoon and buy our supplies wholesale for the\r\nnext month and save one third. Not many of your men can do this.\r\nShopkeepers here charge so much. And another thing, they charge very\r\nhigh for coal. If you paid your men every two weeks, instead of\r\nmonthly, it would be as good for the careful men as a raise in wages\r\nof ten per cent or more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Edwards, that shall be done,\" I replied.\r\n\r\nIt involved increased labor and a few more clerks, but that was a\r\nsmall matter. The remark about high prices charged set me to thinking\r\nwhy the men could not open a coöperative store. This was also\r\narranged--the firm agreeing to pay the rent of the building, but\r\ninsisting that the men themselves take the stock and manage it. Out of\r\nthat came the Braddock's Coöperative Society, a valuable institution\r\nfor many reasons, not the least of them that it taught the men that\r\nbusiness had its difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe coal trouble was cured effectively by our agreeing that the\r\ncompany sell all its men coal at the net cost price to us (about half\r\nof what had been charged by coal dealers, so I was told) and arranging\r\nto deliver it at the men's houses--the buyer paying only actual cost\r\nof cartage.\r\n\r\nThere was another matter. We found that the men's savings caused them\r\nanxiety, for little faith have the prudent, saving men in banks and,\r\nunfortunately, our Government at that time did not follow the British\r\nin having post-office deposit banks. We offered to take the actual\r\nsavings of each workman, up to two thousand dollars, and pay six per\r\ncent interest upon them, to encourage thrift. Their money was kept\r\nseparate from the business, in a trust fund, and lent to such as\r\nwished to build homes for themselves. I consider this one of the best\r\nthings that can be done for the saving workman.\r\n\r\nIt was such concessions as these that proved the most profitable\r\ninvestments ever made by the company, even from an economical\r\nstandpoint. It pays to go beyond the letter of the bond with your men.\r\nTwo of my partners, as Mr. Phipps has put it, \"knew my extreme\r\ndisposition to always grant the demands of labor, however\r\nunreasonable,\" but looking back upon my failing in this respect, I\r\nwish it had been greater--much greater. No expenditure returned such\r\ndividends as the friendship of our workmen.\r\n\r\nWe soon had a body of workmen, I truly believe, wholly unequaled--the\r\nbest workmen and the best men ever drawn together. Quarrels and\r\nstrikes became things of the past. Had the Homestead men been our own\r\nold men, instead of men we had to pick up, it is scarcely possible\r\nthat the trouble there in 1892 could have arisen. The scale at the\r\nsteel-rail mills, introduced in 1889, has been running up to the\r\npresent time (1914), and I think there never has been a labor\r\ngrievance at the works since. The men, as I have already stated,\r\ndissolved their old union because there was no use paying dues to a\r\nunion when the men themselves had a three years' contract. Although\r\ntheir labor union is dissolved another and a better one has taken its\r\nplace--a cordial union between the employers and their men, the best\r\nunion of all for both parties.\r\n\r\nIt is for the interest of the employer that his men shall make good\r\nearnings and have steady work. The sliding scale enables the company\r\nto meet the market; and sometimes to take orders and keep the works\r\nrunning, which is the main thing for the working-men. High wages are\r\nwell enough, but they are not to be compared with steady employment.\r\nThe Edgar Thomson Mills are, in my opinion, the ideal works in respect\r\nto the relations of capital and labor. I am told the men in our day,\r\nand even to this day (1914) prefer two to three turns, but three turns\r\nare sure to come. Labor's hours are to be shortened as we progress.\r\nEight hours will be the rule--eight for work, eight for sleep, and\r\neight for rest and recreation.\r\n\r\nThere have been many incidents in my business life proving that labor\r\ntroubles are not solely founded upon wages. I believe the best\r\npreventive of quarrels to be recognition of, and sincere interest in,\r\nthe men, satisfying them that you really care for them and that you\r\nrejoice in their success. This I can sincerely say--that I always\r\nenjoyed my conferences with our workmen, which were not always in\r\nregard to wages, and that the better I knew the men the more I liked\r\nthem. They have usually two virtues to the employer's one, and they\r\nare certainly more generous to each other.\r\n\r\nLabor is usually helpless against capital. The employer, perhaps,\r\ndecides to shut up the shops; he ceases to make profits for a short\r\ntime. There is no change in his habits, food, clothing, pleasures--no\r\nagonizing fear of want. Contrast this with his workman whose lessening\r\nmeans of subsistence torment him. He has few comforts, scarcely the\r\nnecessities for his wife and children in health, and for the sick\r\nlittle ones no proper treatment. It is not capital we need to guard,\r\nbut helpless labor. If I returned to business to-morrow, fear of labor\r\ntroubles would not enter my mind, but tenderness for poor and\r\nsometimes misguided though well-meaning laborers would fill my heart\r\nand soften it; and thereby soften theirs.\r\n\r\nUpon my return to Pittsburgh in 1892, after the Homestead trouble, I\r\nwent to the works and met many of the old men who had not been\r\nconcerned in the riot. They expressed the opinion that if I had been\r\nat home the strike would never have happened. I told them that the\r\ncompany had offered generous terms and beyond its offer I should not\r\nhave gone; that before their cable reached me in Scotland, the\r\nGovernor of the State had appeared on the scene with troops and wished\r\nthe law vindicated; that the question had then passed out of my\r\npartners' hands. I added:\r\n\r\n\"You were badly advised. My partners' offer should have been accepted.\r\nIt was very generous. I don't know that I would have offered so much.\"\r\n\r\nTo this one of the rollers said to me:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mr. Carnegie, it wasn't a question of dollars. The boys would\r\nhave let you kick 'em, but they wouldn't let that other man stroke\r\ntheir hair.\"\r\n\r\nSo much does sentiment count for in the practical affairs of life,\r\neven with the laboring classes. This is not generally believed by\r\nthose who do not know them, but I am certain that disputes about wages\r\ndo not account for one half the disagreements between capital and\r\nlabor. There is lack of due appreciation and of kind treatment of\r\nemployees upon the part of the employers.\r\n\r\nSuits had been entered against many of the strikers, but upon my\r\nreturn these were promptly dismissed. All the old men who remained,\r\nand had not been guilty of violence, were taken back. I had cabled\r\nfrom Scotland urging that Mr. Schwab be sent back to Homestead. He had\r\nbeen only recently promoted to the Edgar Thomson Works. He went back,\r\nand \"Charlie,\" as he was affectionately called, soon restored order,\r\npeace, and harmony. Had he remained at the Homestead Works, in all\r\nprobability no serious trouble would have arisen. \"Charlie\" liked his\r\nworkmen and they liked him; but there still remained at Homestead an\r\nunsatisfactory element in the men who had previously been discarded\r\nfrom our various works for good reasons and had found employment at\r\nthe new works before we purchased them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE \"GOSPEL OF WEALTH\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter my book, \"The Gospel of Wealth,\"[44] was published, it was\r\ninevitable that I should live up to its teachings by ceasing to\r\nstruggle for more wealth. I resolved to stop accumulating and begin\r\nthe infinitely more serious and difficult task of wise distribution.\r\nOur profits had reached forty millions of dollars per year and the\r\nprospect of increased earnings before us was amazing. Our successors,\r\nthe United States Steel Corporation, soon after the purchase, netted\r\nsixty millions in one year. Had our company continued in business and\r\nadhered to our plans of extension, we figured that seventy millions in\r\nthat year might have been earned.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: _The Gospel of Wealth_ (Century Company, New York, 1900)\r\ncontains various magazine articles written between 1886 and 1899 and\r\npublished in the _Youth's Companion_, the _Century Magazine_, the\r\n_North American Review_, the _Forum_, the _Contemporary Review_, the\r\n_Fortnightly Review_, the _Nineteenth Century_, and the _Scottish\r\nLeader_. Gladstone asked that the article in the _North American\r\nReview_ be printed in England. It was published in the _Pall Mall\r\nBudget_ and christened the \"Gospel of Wealth.\" Gladstone, Cardinal\r\nManning, Rev. Hugh Price, and Rev. Dr. Hermann Adler answered it, and\r\nMr. Carnegie replied to them.]\r\n\r\nSteel had ascended the throne and was driving away all inferior\r\nmaterial. It was clearly seen that there was a great future ahead; but\r\nso far as I was concerned I knew the task of distribution before me\r\nwould tax me in my old age to the utmost. As usual, Shakespeare had\r\nplaced his talismanic touch upon the thought and framed the sentence--\r\n\r\n    \"So distribution should undo excess,\r\n    And each man have enough.\"\r\n\r\nAt this juncture--that is March, 1901--Mr. Schwab told me Mr. Morgan\r\nhad said to him he should really like to know if I wished to retire\r\nfrom business; if so he thought he could arrange it. He also said he\r\nhad consulted our partners and that they were disposed to sell, being\r\nattracted by the terms Mr. Morgan had offered. I told Mr. Schwab that\r\nif my partners were desirous to sell I would concur, and we finally\r\nsold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES M. SCHWAB]\r\n\r\nThere had been so much deception by speculators buying old iron and\r\nsteel mills and foisting them upon innocent purchasers at inflated\r\nvalues--hundred-dollar shares in some cases selling for a trifle--that\r\nI declined to take anything for the common stock. Had I done so, it\r\nwould have given me just about one hundred millions more of five per\r\ncent bonds, which Mr. Morgan said afterwards I could have obtained.\r\nSuch was the prosperity and such the money value of our steel\r\nbusiness. Events proved I should have been quite justified in asking\r\nthe additional sum named, for the common stock has paid five per cent\r\ncontinuously since.[45] But I had enough, as has been proved, to keep\r\nme busier than ever before, trying to distribute it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: The Carnegie Steel Company was bought by Mr. Morgan at\r\nMr. Carnegie's own price. There was some talk at the time of his\r\nholding out for a higher price than he received, but testifying before\r\na committee of the House of Representatives in January, 1912, Mr.\r\nCarnegie said: \"I considered what was fair: and that is the option\r\nMorgan got. Schwab went down and arranged it. I never saw Morgan on\r\nthe subject or any man connected with him. Never a word passed between\r\nhim and me. I gave my memorandum and Morgan saw it was eminently fair.\r\nI have been told many times since by insiders that I should have asked\r\n$100,000,000 more and could have got it easily. Once for all, I want\r\nto put a stop to all this talk about Mr. Carnegie 'forcing high prices\r\nfor anything.'\"]\r\n\r\nMy first distribution was to the men in the mills. The following\r\nletters and papers will explain the gift:\r\n\r\n     _New York, N.Y., March 12, 1901_\r\n\r\n     I make this first use of surplus wealth, four millions of\r\n     first mortgage 5% Bonds, upon retiring from business, as an\r\n     acknowledgment of the deep debt which I owe to the\r\n     workmen who have contributed so greatly to my success. It is\r\n     designed to relieve those who may suffer from accidents, and\r\n     provide small pensions for those needing help in old age.\r\n\r\n     In addition I give one million dollars of such bonds, the\r\n     proceeds thereof to be used to maintain the libraries and\r\n     halls I have built for our workmen.\r\n\r\nIn return, the Homestead workmen presented the following address:\r\n\r\n     _Munhall, Pa., Feb'y 23, 1903_\r\n\r\n     MR. ANDREW CARNEGIE\r\n     New York, N.Y.\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n     We, the employees of the Homestead Steel Works, desire by\r\n     this means to express to you through our Committee our great\r\n     appreciation of your benevolence in establishing the \"Andrew\r\n     Carnegie Relief Fund,\" the first annual report of its\r\n     operation having been placed before us during the past\r\n     month.\r\n\r\n     The interest which you have always shown in your workmen has\r\n     won for you an appreciation which cannot be expressed by\r\n     mere words. Of the many channels through which you have\r\n     sought to do good, we believe that the \"Andrew Carnegie\r\n     Relief Fund\" stands first. We have personal knowledge of\r\n     cares lightened and of hope and strength renewed in homes\r\n     where human prospects seemed dark and discouraging.\r\n\r\n     Respectfully yours\r\n\r\n               { HARRY F.

VEIGH\r\n\r\nI sailed soon for Europe, and as usual some of my partners did not\r\nfail to accompany me to the steamer and bade me good-bye. But, oh! the\r\ndifference to me! Say what we would, do what we would, the solemn\r\nchange had come. This I could not fail to realize. The wrench was\r\nindeed severe and there was pain in the good-bye which was also a\r\nfarewell.\r\n\r\nUpon my return to New York some months later, I felt myself entirely\r\nout of place, but was much cheered by seeing several of \"the boys\" on\r\nthe pier to welcome me--the same dear friends, but so different. I had\r\nlost my partners, but not my friends. This was something; it was much.\r\nStill a vacancy was left. I had now to take up my self-appointed task\r\nof wisely disposing of surplus wealth. That would keep me deeply\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nOne day my eyes happened to see a line in that most valuable paper,\r\nthe \"Scottish American,\" in which I had found many gems. This was the\r\nline:\r\n\r\n\"The gods send thread for a web begun.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed almost as if it had been sent directly to me. This sank into\r\nmy heart, and I resolved to begin at once my first web. True enough,\r\nthe gods sent thread in the proper form. Dr. J.S. Billings, of the New\r\nYork Public Libraries, came as their agent, and of dollars, five and a\r\nquarter millions went at one stroke for sixty-eight branch libraries,\r\npromised for New York City. Twenty more libraries for Brooklyn\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nMy father, as I have stated, had been one of the five pioneers in\r\nDunfermline who combined and gave access to their few books to their\r\nless fortunate neighbors. I had followed in his footsteps by giving my\r\nnative town a library--its foundation stone laid by my mother--so that\r\nthis public library was really my first gift. It was followed by\r\ngiving a public library and hall to Allegheny City--our first home in\r\nAmerica. President Harrison kindly accompanied me from Washington and\r\nopened these buildings. Soon after this, Pittsburgh asked for a\r\nlibrary, which was given. This developed, in due course, into a group\r\nof buildings embracing a museum, a picture gallery, technical schools,\r\nand the Margaret Morrison School for Young Women. This group of\r\nbuildings I opened to the public November 5, 1895. In Pittsburgh I had\r\nmade my fortune and in the twenty-four millions already spent on this\r\ngroup,[46] she gets back only a small part of what she gave, and to\r\nwhich she is richly entitled.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: The total gifts to the Carnegie Institute at Pittsburgh\r\namounted to about twenty-eight million dollars.]\r\n\r\nThe second large gift was to found the Carnegie Institution of\r\nWashington. The 28th of January, 1902, I gave ten million dollars in\r\nfive per cent bonds, to which there has been added sufficient to make\r\nthe total cash value twenty-five millions of dollars, the additions\r\nbeing made upon record of results obtained. I naturally wished to\r\nconsult President Roosevelt upon the matter, and if possible to induce\r\nthe Secretary of State, Mr. John Hay, to serve as chairman, which he\r\nreadily agreed to do. With him were associated as directors my old\r\nfriend Abram S. Hewitt, Dr. Billings, William E. Dodge, Elihu Root,\r\nColonel Higginson, D.O. Mills, Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, and others.\r\n\r\nWhen I showed President Roosevelt the list of the distinguished men\r\nwho had agreed to serve, he remarked: \"You could not duplicate it.\" He\r\nstrongly favored the foundation, which was incorporated by an act of\r\nCongress April 28, 1904, as follows:\r\n\r\n     To encourage in the broadest and most liberal manner\r\n     investigations, research and discovery, and the application\r\n     of knowledge to the improvement of mankind; and, in\r\n     particular, to conduct, endow and assist investigation in\r\n     any department of science, literature or art, and to this\r\n     end to coöperate with governments, universities, colleges,\r\n     technical schools, learned societies, and individuals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CARNEGIE INSTITUTE AT PITTSBURGH]\r\n\r\nI was indebted to Dr. Billings as my guide, in selecting Dr. Daniel C.\r\nGilman as the first President. He passed away some years later. Dr.\r\nBillings then recommended the present highly successful president, Dr.\r\nRobert S. Woodward. Long may he continue to guide the affairs of the\r\nInstitution! The history of its achievements is so well known through\r\nits publications that details here are unnecessary. I may, however,\r\nrefer to two of its undertakings that are somewhat unique. It is doing\r\na world-wide service with the wood-and-bronze yacht, \"Carnegie,\" which\r\nis voyaging around the world correcting the errors of the earlier\r\nsurveys. Many of these ocean surveys have been found misleading, owing\r\nto variations of the compass. Bronze being non-magnetic, while iron\r\nand steel are highly so, previous observations have proved liable to\r\nerror. A notable instance is that of the stranding of a Cunard\r\nsteamship near the Azores. Captain Peters, of the \"Carnegie,\" thought\r\nit advisable to test this case and found that the captain of the\r\nill-fated steamer was sailing on the course laid down upon the\r\nadmiralty map, and was not to blame. The original observation was\r\nwrong. The error caused by variation was promptly corrected.\r\n\r\nThis is only one of numerous corrections reported to the nations who\r\ngo down to the sea in ships. Their thanks are our ample reward. In the\r\ndeed of gift I expressed the hope that our young Republic might some\r\nday be able to repay, at least in some degree, the great debt it owes\r\nto the older lands. Nothing gives me deeper satisfaction than the\r\nknowledge that it has to some extent already begun to do so.\r\n\r\nWith the unique service rendered by the wandering \"Carnegie,\" we may\r\nrank that of the fixed observatory upon Mount Wilson, California, at\r\nan altitude of 5886 feet. Professor Hale is in charge of it. He\r\nattended the gathering of leading astronomers in Rome one year, and\r\nsuch were his revelations there that these savants resolved their next\r\nmeeting should be on top of Mount Wilson. And so it was.\r\n\r\nThere is but one Mount Wilson. From a depth seventy-two feet down in\r\nthe earth photographs have been taken of new stars. On the first of\r\nthese plates many new worlds--I believe sixteen--were discovered. On\r\nthe second I think it was sixty new worlds which had come into our\r\nken, and on the third plate there were estimated to be more than a\r\nhundred--several of them said to be twenty times the size of our sun.\r\nSome of them were so distant as to require eight years for their light\r\nto reach us, which inclines us to bow our heads whispering to\r\nourselves, \"All we know is as nothing to the unknown.\" When the\r\nmonster new glass, three times larger than any existing, is in\r\noperation, what revelations are to come! I am assured if a race\r\ninhabits the moon they will be clearly seen.\r\n\r\nThe third delightful task was founding the Hero Fund, in which my\r\nwhole heart was concerned. I had heard of a serious accident in a coal\r\npit near Pittsburgh, and how the former superintendent, Mr. Taylor,\r\nalthough then engaged in other pursuits, had instantly driven to the\r\nscene, hoping to be of use in the crisis. Rallying volunteers, who\r\nresponded eagerly, he led them down the pit to rescue those below.\r\nAlas, alas, he the heroic leader lost his own life.\r\n\r\nI could not get the thought of this out of my mind. My dear, dear\r\nfriend, Mr. Richard Watson Gilder, had sent me the following true and\r\nbeautiful poem, and I re-read it the morning after the accident, and\r\nresolved then to establish the Hero Fund.\r\n\r\n    IN THE TIME OF PEACE\r\n\r\n    'Twas said: \"When roll of drum and battle's roar\r\n    Shall cease upon the earth, O, then no more\r\n\r\n    The deed--the race--of heroes in the land.\"\r\n    But scarce that word was breathed when one small hand\r\n\r\n    Lifted victorious o'er a giant wrong\r\n    That had its victims crushed through ages long;\r\n\r\n    Some woman set her pale and quivering face\r\n    Firm as a rock against a man's disgrace;\r\n\r\n    A little child suffered in silence lest\r\n    His savage pain should wound a mother's breast;\r\n\r\n    Some quiet scholar flung his gauntlet down\r\n    And risked, in Truth's great name, the synod's frown;\r\n\r\n    A civic hero, in the calm realm of laws,\r\n    Did that which suddenly drew a world's applause;\r\n\r\n    And one to the pest his lithe young body gave\r\n    That he a thousand thousand lives might save.\r\n\r\nHence arose the five-million-dollar fund to reward heroes, or to\r\nsupport the families of heroes, who perish in the effort to serve or\r\nsave their fellows, and to supplement what employers or others do in\r\ncontributing to the support of the families of those left destitute\r\nthrough accidents. This fund, established April 15, 1904, has proved\r\nfrom every point of view a decided success. I cherish a fatherly\r\nregard for it since no one suggested it to me. As far as I know, it\r\nnever had been thought of; hence it is emphatically \"my ain bairn.\"\r\nLater I extended it to my native land, Great Britain, with\r\nheadquarters at Dunfermline--the Trustees of the Carnegie Dunfermline\r\nTrust undertaking its administration, and splendidly have they\r\nsucceeded. In due time it was extended to France, Germany, Italy,\r\nBelgium, Holland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Denmark.\r\n\r\nRegarding its workings in Germany, I received a letter from David\r\nJayne Hill, our American Ambassador at Berlin, from which I quote:\r\n\r\n     My main object in writing now is to tell you how pleased His\r\n     Majesty is with the working of the German Hero Fund. He is\r\n     enthusiastic about it and spoke in most complimentary terms\r\n     of your discernment, as well as your generosity in founding\r\n     it. He did not believe it would fill so important a place\r\n     as it is doing. He told me of several cases that are really\r\n     touching, and which would otherwise have been wholly\r\n     unprovided for. One was that of a young man who saved a boy\r\n     from drowning and just as they were about to lift him out of\r\n     the water, after passing up the child into a boat, his heart\r\n     failed, and he sank. He left a lovely young wife and a\r\n     little boy. She has already been helped by the Hero Fund to\r\n     establish a little business from which she can make a\r\n     living, and the education of the boy, who is very bright,\r\n     will be looked after. This is but one example.\r\n\r\n     Valentini (Chief of the Civil Cabinet), who was somewhat\r\n     skeptical at first regarding the need of such a fund, is now\r\n     glowing with enthusiasm about it, and he tells me the whole\r\n     Commission, which is composed of carefully chosen men, is\r\n     earnestly devoted to the work of making the very best and\r\n     wisest use of their means and has devoted much time to their\r\n     decisions.\r\n\r\n     They have corresponded with the English and French\r\n     Commission, arranged to exchange reports, and made plans to\r\n     keep in touch with one another in their work. They were\r\n     deeply interested in the American report and have learned\r\n     much from it.\r\n\r\nKing Edward of Britain was deeply impressed by the provisions of the\r\nfund, and wrote me an autograph letter of appreciation of this and\r\nother gifts to my native land, which I deeply value, and hence insert.\r\n\r\n     _Windsor Castle, November 21, 1908_\r\n\r\n     DEAR MR. CARNEGIE:\r\n\r\n     I have for some time past been anxious to express to you my\r\n     sense of your generosity for the great public objects which\r\n     you have presented to this country, the land of your birth.\r\n\r\n     Scarcely less admirable than the gifts themselves is the\r\n     great care and thought you have taken in guarding against\r\n     their misuse.\r\n\r\n     I am anxious to tell you how warmly I recognize your most\r\n     generous benefactions and the great services they are likely\r\n     to confer upon the country.\r\n\r\n     As a mark of recognition, I hope you will accept the\r\n     portrait of myself which I am sending to you.\r\n\r\n     Believe me, dear Mr. Carnegie,\r\n\r\n     Sincerely yours\r\n\r\n     EDWARD R. & I.\r\n\r\nSome of the newspapers in America were doubtful of the merits of the\r\nHero Fund and the first annual report was criticized, but all this has\r\npassed away and the action of the fund is now warmly extolled. It has\r\nconquered, and long will it be before the trust is allowed to perish!\r\nThe heroes of the barbarian past wounded or killed their fellows; the\r\nheroes of our civilized day serve or save theirs. Such the difference\r\nbetween physical and moral courage, between barbarism and\r\ncivilization. Those who belong to the first class are soon to pass\r\naway, for we are finally to regard men who slay each other as we now\r\ndo cannibals who eat each other; but those in the latter class will\r\nnot die as long as man exists upon the earth, for such heroism as they\r\ndisplay is god-like.\r\n\r\nThe Hero Fund will prove chiefly a pension fund. Already it has many\r\npensioners, heroes or the widows or children of heroes. A strange\r\nmisconception arose at first about it. Many thought that its purpose\r\nwas to stimulate heroic action, that heroes were to be induced to play\r\ntheir parts for the sake of reward. This never entered my mind. It is\r\nabsurd. True heroes think not of reward. They are inspired and think\r\nonly of their fellows endangered; never of themselves. The fund is\r\nintended to pension or provide in the most suitable manner for the\r\nhero should he be disabled, or for those dependent upon him should he\r\nperish in his attempt to save others. It has made a fine start and\r\nwill grow in popularity year after year as its aims and services are\r\nbetter understood. To-day we have in America 1430 hero pensioners or\r\ntheir families on our list.\r\n\r\nI found the president for the Hero Fund in a Carnegie veteran, one of\r\nthe original boys, Charlie Taylor. No salary for Charlie--not a cent\r\nwould he ever take. He loves the work so much that I believe he would\r\npay highly for permission to live with it. He is the right man in the\r\nright place. He has charge also, with Mr. Wilmot's able assistance, of\r\nthe pensions for Carnegie workmen (Carnegie Relief Fund[47]); also the\r\npensions for railway employees of my old division. Three relief funds\r\nand all of them benefiting others.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: This fund is now managed separately.]\r\n\r\nI got my revenge one day upon Charlie, who was always urging me to do\r\nfor others. He is a graduate of Lehigh University and one of her most\r\nloyal sons. Lehigh wished a building and Charlie was her chief\r\nadvocate. I said nothing, but wrote President Drinker offering the\r\nfunds for the building conditioned upon my naming it. He agreed, and I\r\ncalled it \"Taylor Hall.\" When Charlie discovered this, he came and\r\nprotested that it would make him ridiculous, that he had only been a\r\nmodest graduate, and was not entitled to have his name publicly\r\nhonored, and so on. I enjoyed his plight immensely, waiting until he\r\nhad finished, and then said that it would probably make him somewhat\r\nridiculous if I insisted upon \"Taylor Hall,\" but he ought to be\r\nwilling to sacrifice himself somewhat for Lehigh. If he wasn't\r\nconsumed with vanity he would not care much how his name was used if\r\nit helped his Alma Mater. Taylor was not much of a name anyhow. It was\r\nhis insufferable vanity that made such a fuss. He should conquer it.\r\nHe could make his decision. He could sacrifice the name of Taylor or\r\nsacrifice Lehigh, just as he liked, but: \"No Taylor, no Hall.\" I had\r\nhim! Visitors who may look upon that structure in after days and\r\nwonder who Taylor was may rest assured that he was a loyal son of\r\nLehigh, a working, not merely a preaching, apostle of the gospel of\r\nservice to his fellow-men, and one of the best men that ever lived.\r\nSuch is our Lord High Commissioner of Pensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nEDUCATIONAL AND PENSION FUNDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fifteen-million-dollar pension fund for aged university professors\r\n(The Carnegie Endowment for the Advancement of Learning), the fourth\r\nimportant gift, given in June, 1905, required the selection of\r\ntwenty-five trustees from among the presidents of educational\r\ninstitutions in the United States. When twenty-four of\r\nthese--President Harper, of Chicago University, being absent through\r\nillness--honored me by meeting at our house for organization, I\r\nobtained an important accession of those who were to become more\r\nintimate friends. Mr. Frank A. Vanderlip proved of great service at\r\nthe start--his Washington experience being most valuable--and in our\r\npresident, Dr. Henry S. Pritchett, we found the indispensable man.\r\n\r\nThis fund is very near and dear to me--knowing, as I do, many who are\r\nsoon to become beneficiaries, and convinced as I am of their worth and\r\nthe value of the service already rendered by them. Of all professions,\r\nthat of teaching is probably the most unfairly, yes, most meanly paid,\r\nthough it should rank with the highest. Educated men, devoting their\r\nlives to teaching the young, receive mere pittances. When I first took\r\nmy seat as a trustee of Cornell University, I was shocked to find how\r\nsmall were the salaries of the professors, as a rule ranking below the\r\nsalaries of some of our clerks. To save for old age with these men is\r\nimpossible. Hence the universities without pension funds are compelled\r\nto retain men who are no longer able, should no longer be required, to\r\nperform their duties. Of the usefulness of the fund no doubt can be\r\nentertained.[48] The first list of beneficiaries published was\r\nconclusive upon this point, containing as it did several names of\r\nworld-wide reputation, so great had been their contributions to the\r\nstock of human knowledge. Many of these beneficiaries and their widows\r\nhave written me most affecting letters. These I can never destroy, for\r\nif I ever have a fit of melancholy, I know the cure lies in re-reading\r\nthese letters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: The total amount of this fund in 1919 was $29,250,000.]\r\n\r\nMy friend, Mr. Thomas Shaw (now Lord Shaw), of Dunfermline had written\r\nan article for one of the English reviews showing that many poor\r\npeople in Scotland were unable to pay the fees required to give their\r\nchildren a university education, although some had deprived themselves\r\nof comforts in order to do so. After reading Mr. Shaw's article the\r\nidea came to me to give ten millions in five per cent bonds, one half\r\nof the £104,000 yearly revenue from it to be used to pay the fees of\r\nthe deserving poor students and the other half to improve the\r\nuniversities.\r\n\r\nThe first meeting of the trustees of this fund (The Carnegie Trust for\r\nthe Universities of Scotland) was held in the Edinburgh office of the\r\nSecretary of State for Scotland in 1902, Lord Balfour of Burleigh\r\npresiding. It was a notable body of men--Prime Minister Balfour, Sir\r\nHenry Campbell-Bannerman (afterwards Prime Minister), John Morley (now\r\nViscount Morley), James Bryce (now Viscount Bryce), the Earl of Elgin,\r\nLord Rosebery, Lord Reay, Mr. Shaw (now Lord Shaw), Dr. John Ross of\r\nDunfermline, \"the man-of-all-work\" that makes for the happiness or\r\ninstruction of his fellow-man, and others. I explained that I had\r\nasked them to act because I could not entrust funds to the faculties\r\nof the Scottish universities after reading the report of a recent\r\ncommission. Mr. Balfour promptly exclaimed: \"Not a penny, not a\r\npenny!\" The Earl of Elgin, who had been a member of the commission,\r\nfully concurred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANDREW CARNEGIE AND VISCOUNT BRYCE]\r\n\r\nThe details of the proposed fund being read, the Earl of Elgin was not\r\nsure about accepting a trust which was not strict and specific. He\r\nwished to know just what his duties were. I had given a majority of\r\nthe trustees the right to change the objects of beneficence and modes\r\nof applying funds, should they in after days decide that the purposes\r\nand modes prescribed for education in Scotland had become unsuitable\r\nor unnecessary for the advanced times. Balfour of Burleigh agreed with\r\nthe Earl and so did Prime Minister Balfour, who said he had never\r\nheard of a testator before who was willing to give such powers. He\r\nquestioned the propriety of doing so.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I said, \"Mr. Balfour, I have never known of a body of men\r\ncapable of legislating for the generation ahead, and in some cases\r\nthose who attempt to legislate even for their own generation are not\r\nthought to be eminently successful.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a ripple of laughter in which the Prime Minister himself\r\nheartily joined, and he then said:\r\n\r\n\"You are right, quite right; but you are, I think, the first great\r\ngiver who has been wise enough to take this view.\"\r\n\r\nI had proposed that a majority should have the power, but Lord Balfour\r\nsuggested not less than two thirds. This was accepted by the Earl of\r\nElgin and approved by all. I am very sure it is a wise provision, as\r\nafter days will prove. It is incorporated in all my large gifts, and I\r\nrest assured that this feature will in future times prove valuable.\r\nThe Earl of Elgin, of Dunfermline, did not hesitate to become\r\nChairman of this trust. When I told Premier Balfour that I hoped Elgin\r\ncould be induced to assume this duty, he said promptly, \"You could not\r\nget a better man in Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\nWe are all entirely satisfied now upon that point. The query is: where\r\ncould we get his equal?\r\n\r\nIt is an odd coincidence that there are only four living men who have\r\nbeen made Burgesses and received the Freedom of Dunfermline, and all\r\nare connected with the trust for the Universities of Scotland, Sir\r\nHenry Campbell-Bannerman, the Earl of Elgin, Dr. John Ross, and\r\nmyself. But there is a lady in the circle to-day, the only one ever so\r\ngreatly honored with the Freedom of Dunfermline, Mrs. Carnegie, whose\r\ndevotion to the town, like my own, is intense.\r\n\r\nMy election to the Lord Rectorship of St. Andrews in 1902 proved a\r\nvery important event in my life. It admitted me to the university\r\nworld, to which I had been a stranger. Few incidents in my life have\r\nso deeply impressed me as the first meeting of the faculty, when I\r\ntook my seat in the old chair occupied successively by so many\r\ndistinguished Lord Rectors during the nearly five hundred years which\r\nhave elapsed since St. Andrews was founded. I read the collection of\r\nrectorial speeches as a preparation for the one I was soon to make.\r\nThe most remarkable paragraph I met with in any of them was Dean\r\nStanley's advice to the students to \"go to Burns for your theology.\"\r\nThat a high dignitary of the Church and a favorite of Queen Victoria\r\nshould venture to say this to the students of John Knox's University\r\nis most suggestive as showing how even theology improves with the\r\nyears. The best rules of conduct are in Burns. First there is: \"Thine\r\nown reproach alone do fear.\" I took it as a motto early in life. And\r\nsecondly:\r\n\r\n    \"The fear o' hell's a hangman's whip\r\n    To haud the wretch in order;\r\n    But where ye feel your honor grip,\r\n    Let that aye be your border.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Stuart Mill's rectorial address to the St. Andrews students is\r\nremarkable. He evidently wished to give them of his best. The\r\nprominence he assigns to music as an aid to high living and pure\r\nrefined enjoyment is notable. Such is my own experience.\r\n\r\nAn invitation given to the principals of the four Scotch universities\r\nand their wives or daughters to spend a week at Skibo resulted in much\r\njoy to Mrs. Carnegie and myself. The first meeting was attended by the\r\nEarl of Elgin, chairman of the Trust for the Universities of Scotland,\r\nand Lord Balfour of Burleigh, Secretary for Scotland, and Lady\r\nBalfour. After that \"Principals' Week\" each year became an established\r\ncustom. They as well as we became friends, and thereby, they all\r\nagree, great good results to the universities. A spirit of coöperation\r\nis stimulated. Taking my hand upon leaving after the first yearly\r\nvisit, Principal Lang said:\r\n\r\n\"It has taken the principals of the Scotch universities five hundred\r\nyears to learn how to begin our sessions. Spending a week together is\r\nthe solution.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the memorable results of the gathering at Skibo in 1906 was\r\nthat Miss Agnes Irwin, Dean of Radcliffe College, and\r\ngreat-granddaughter of Benjamin Franklin, spent the principals' week\r\nwith us and all were charmed with her. Franklin received his first\r\ndoctor's degree from St. Andrews University, nearly one hundred and\r\nfifty years ago. The second centenary of his birth was finely\r\ncelebrated in Philadelphia, and St. Andrews, with numerous other\r\nuniversities throughout the world, sent addresses. St. Andrews also\r\nsent a degree to the great-granddaughter. As Lord Rector, I was\r\ndeputed to confer it and place the mantle upon her. This was done the\r\nfirst evening before a large audience, when more than two hundred\r\naddresses were presented.\r\n\r\nThe audience was deeply impressed, as well it might be. St. Andrews\r\nUniversity, the first to confer the degree upon the great-grandfather,\r\nconferred the same degree upon the great-grandchild one hundred and\r\nforty-seven years later (and this upon her own merits as Dean of\r\nRadcliffe College); sent it across the Atlantic to be bestowed by the\r\nhands of its Lord Rector, the first who was not a British subject, but\r\nwho was born one as Franklin was, and who became an American citizen\r\nas Franklin did; the ceremony performed in Philadelphia where Franklin\r\nrests, in the presence of a brilliant assembly met to honor his\r\nmemory. It was all very beautiful, and I esteemed myself favored,\r\nindeed, to be the medium of such a graceful and appropriate ceremony.\r\nPrincipal Donaldson of St. Andrews was surely inspired when he thought\r\nof it!\r\n\r\nMy unanimous reëlection by the students of St. Andrews, without a\r\ncontest for a second term, was deeply appreciated. And I liked the\r\nRector's nights, when the students claim him for themselves, no member\r\nof the faculty being invited. We always had a good time. After the\r\nfirst one, Principal Donaldson gave me the verdict of the Secretary as\r\nrendered to him: \"Rector So-and-So talked _to_ us, Rector Thus-and-So\r\ntalked _at_ us, both from the platform; Mr. Carnegie sat down in our\r\ncircle and talked _with_ us.\"\r\n\r\nThe question of aid to our own higher educational institutions often\r\nintruded itself upon me, but my belief was that our chief\r\nuniversities, such as Harvard and Columbia, with five to ten thousand\r\nstudents,[49] were large enough; that further growth was undesirable;\r\nthat the smaller institutions (the colleges especially) were in\r\ngreater need of help and that it would be a better use of surplus\r\nwealth to aid them. Accordingly, I afterwards confined myself to these\r\nand am satisfied that this was wise. At a later date we found Mr.\r\nRockefeller's splendid educational fund, The General Education Board,\r\nand ourselves were working in this fruitful field without\r\nconsultation, with sometimes undesirable results. Mr. Rockefeller\r\nwished me to join his board and this I did. Coöperation was soon found\r\nto be much to our mutual advantage, and we now work in unison.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: Columbia University in 1920 numbered all told some\r\n25,000 students in the various departments.]\r\n\r\nIn giving to colleges quite a number of my friends have been honored\r\nas was my partner Charlie Taylor. Conway Hall at Dickinson College,\r\nwas named for Moncure D. Conway, whose Autobiography, recently\r\npublished, is pronounced \"literature\" by the \"Athenæum.\" It says:\r\n\"These two volumes lie on the table glistening like gems 'midst the\r\npiles of autobiographical rubbish by which they are surrounded.\" That\r\nis rather suggestive for one who is adding to the pile.\r\n\r\nThe last chapter in Mr. Conway's Autobiography ends with the following\r\nparagraph:\r\n\r\n     Implore Peace, O my reader, from whom I now part. Implore\r\n     peace not of deified thunder clouds but of every man, woman,\r\n     child thou shalt meet. Do not merely offer the prayer, \"Give\r\n     peace in our time,\" but do thy part to answer it! Then, at\r\n     least, though the world be at strife, there shall be peace\r\n     in thee.\r\n\r\nMy friend has put his finger upon our deepest disgrace. It surely must\r\nsoon be abolished between civilized nations.\r\n\r\nThe Stanton Chair of Economics at Kenyon College, Ohio, was founded in\r\nmemory of Edwin M. Stanton, who kindly greeted me as a boy in\r\nPittsburgh when I delivered telegrams to him, and was ever cordial to\r\nme in Washington, when I was an assistant to Secretary Scott. The\r\nHanna Chair in Western Reserve University, Cleveland; the John Hay\r\nLibrary at Brown University; the second Elihu Root Fund for Hamilton,\r\nthe Mrs. Cleveland Library for Wellesley, gave me pleasure to christen\r\nafter these friends. I hope more are to follow, commemorating those I\r\nhave known, liked, and honored. I also wished a General Dodge Library\r\nand a Gayley Library to be erected from my gifts, but these friends\r\nhad already obtained such honor from their respective Alma Maters.\r\n\r\nMy first gift to Hamilton College was to be named the Elihu Root\r\nFoundation, but that ablest of all our Secretaries of State, and in\r\nthe opinion of President Roosevelt, \"the wisest man he ever knew,\"\r\ntook care, it seems, not to mention the fact to the college\r\nauthorities. When I reproached him with this dereliction, he\r\nlaughingly replied:\r\n\r\n\"Well, I promise not to cheat you the next gift you give us.\"\r\n\r\nAnd by a second gift this lapse was repaired after all, but I took\r\ncare not to entrust the matter directly to him. The Root Fund of\r\nHamilton[50] is now established beyond his power to destroy. Root is a\r\ngreat man, and, as the greatest only are he is, in his simplicity,\r\nsublime. President Roosevelt declared he would crawl on his hands and\r\nknees from the White House to the Capitol if this would insure Root's\r\nnomination to the presidency with a prospect of success. He was\r\nconsidered vulnerable because he had been counsel for corporations\r\nand was too little of the spouter and the demagogue, too much of the\r\nmodest, retiring statesman to split the ears of the groundlings.[51]\r\nThe party foolishly decided not to risk Root.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: It amounts to $250,000.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: At the Meeting in Memory of the Life and Work of Andrew\r\nCarnegie held on April 25, 1920, in the Engineering Societies Building\r\nin New York, Mr. Root made an address in the course of which, speaking\r\nof Mr. Carnegie, he said:\r\n\r\n\"He belonged to that great race of nation-builders who have made the\r\ndevelopment of America the wonder of the world.... He was the\r\nkindliest man I ever knew. Wealth had brought to him no hardening of\r\nthe heart, nor made him forget the dreams of his youth. Kindly,\r\naffectionate, charitable in his judgments, unrestrained in his\r\nsympathies, noble in his impulses, I wish that all the people who\r\nthink of him as a rich man giving away money he did not need could\r\nknow of the hundreds of kindly things he did unknown to the world.\"]\r\n\r\nMy connection with Hampton and Tuskegee Institutes, which promote the\r\nelevation of the colored race we formerly kept in slavery, has been a\r\nsource of satisfaction and pleasure, and to know Booker Washington is\r\na rare privilege. We should all take our hats off to the man who not\r\nonly raised himself from slavery, but helped raise millions of his\r\nrace to a higher stage of civilization. Mr. Washington called upon me\r\na few days after my gift of six hundred thousand dollars was made to\r\nTuskegee and asked if he might be allowed to make one suggestion. I\r\nsaid: \"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have kindly specified that a sum from that fund be set aside for\r\nthe future support of myself and wife during our lives, and we are\r\nvery grateful, but, Mr. Carnegie, the sum is far beyond our needs and\r\nwill seem to my race a fortune. Some might feel that I was no longer a\r\npoor man giving my services without thought of saving money. Would you\r\nhave any objection to changing that clause, striking out the sum, and\r\nsubstituting 'only suitable provision'? I'll trust the trustees. Mrs.\r\nWashington and myself need very little.\"\r\n\r\nI did so, and the deed now stands, but when Mr. Baldwin asked for the\r\noriginal letter to exchange it for the substitute, he told me that the\r\nnoble soul objected. That document addressed to him was to be\r\npreserved forever, and handed down; but he would put it aside and let\r\nthe substitute go on file.\r\n\r\nThis is an indication of the character of the leader of his race. No\r\ntruer, more self-sacrificing hero ever lived: a man compounded of all\r\nthe virtues. It makes one better just to know such pure and noble\r\nsouls--human nature in its highest types is already divine here on\r\nearth. If it be asked which man of our age, or even of the past ages,\r\nhas risen from the lowest to the highest, the answer must be Booker\r\nWashington. He rose from slavery to the leadership of his people--a\r\nmodern Moses and Joshua combined, leading his people both onward and\r\nupward.\r\n\r\nIn connection with these institutions I came in contact with their\r\nofficers and trustees--men like Principal Hollis B. Frissell of\r\nHampton, Robert C. Ogden, George Foster Peabody, V. Everit Macy,\r\nGeorge McAneny and William H. Baldwin--recently lost to us, alas!--men\r\nwho labor for others. It was a blessing to know them intimately. The\r\nCooper Union, the Mechanics and Tradesmen's Society, indeed every\r\ninstitution[52] in which I became interested, revealed many men and\r\nwomen devoting their time and thought, not to \"miserable aims that end\r\nwith self,\" but to high ideals which mean the relief and uplift of\r\ntheir less fortunate brethren.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: The universities, colleges, and educational institutions\r\nto which Mr. Carnegie gave either endowment funds or buildings number\r\nfive hundred. All told his gifts to them amounted to $27,000,000.]\r\n\r\nMy giving of organs to churches came very early in my career, I having\r\npresented to less than a hundred members of the Swedenborgian Church\r\nin Allegheny which my father favored, an organ, after declining to\r\ncontribute to the building of a new church for so few. Applications\r\nfrom other churches soon began to pour in, from the grand Catholic\r\nCathedral of Pittsburgh down to the small church in the country\r\nvillage, and I was kept busy. Every church seemed to need a better\r\norgan than it had, and as the full price for the new instrument was\r\npaid, what the old one brought was clear profit. Some ordered organs\r\nfor very small churches which would almost split the rafters, as was\r\nthe case with the first organ given the Swedenborgians; others had\r\nbought organs before applying but our check to cover the amount was\r\nwelcome. Finally, however, a rigid system of giving was developed. A\r\nprinted schedule requiring answers to many questions has now to be\r\nfilled and returned before action is taken. The department is now\r\nperfectly systematized and works admirably because we graduate the\r\ngift according to the size of the church.\r\n\r\nCharges were made in the rigid Scottish Highlands that I was\r\ndemoralizing Christian worship by giving organs to churches. The very\r\nstrict Presbyterians there still denounce as wicked an attempt \"to\r\nworship God with a kist fu' o' whistles,\" instead of using the human\r\nGod-given voice. After that I decided that I should require a partner\r\nin my sin, and therefore asked each congregation to pay one half of\r\nthe desired new organ. Upon this basis the organ department still\r\noperates and continues to do a thriving business, the demand for\r\nimproved organs still being great. Besides, many new churches are\r\nrequired for increasing populations and for these organs are\r\nessential.\r\n\r\nI see no end to it. In requiring the congregation to pay one half the\r\ncost of better instruments, there is assurance of needed and\r\nreasonable expenditure. Believing from my own experience that it is\r\nsalutary for the congregation to hear sacred music at intervals in the\r\nservice and then slowly to disperse to the strains of the\r\nreverence-compelling organ after such sermons as often show us little\r\nof a Heavenly Father, I feel the money spent for organs is well spent.\r\nSo we continue the organ department.[53]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: The \"organ department\" up to 1919 had given 7689 organs\r\nto as many different churches at a cost of over six million dollars.]\r\n\r\nOf all my work of a philanthropic character, my private pension fund\r\ngives me the highest and noblest return. No satisfaction equals that\r\nof feeling you have been permitted to place in comfortable\r\ncircumstances, in their old age, people whom you have long known to be\r\nkind and good and in every way deserving, but who from no fault of\r\ntheir own, have not sufficient means to live respectably, free from\r\nsolicitude as to their mere maintenance. Modest sums insure this\r\nfreedom. It surprised me to find how numerous were those who needed\r\nsome aid to make the difference between an old age of happiness and\r\none of misery. Some such cases had arisen before my retirement from\r\nbusiness, and I had sweet satisfaction from this source. Not one\r\nperson have I ever placed upon the pension list[54] that did not fully\r\ndeserve assistance. It is a real roll of honor and mutual affection.\r\nAll are worthy. There is no publicity about it. No one knows who is\r\nembraced. Not a word is ever breathed to others.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: This amounted to over $250,000 a year.]\r\n\r\nThis is my favorite and best answer to the question which will never\r\ndown in my thoughts: \"What good am I doing in the world to deserve\r\nall my mercies?\" Well, the dear friends of the pension list give me a\r\nsatisfactory reply, and this always comes to me in need. I have had\r\nfar beyond my just share of life's blessings; therefore I never ask\r\nthe Unknown for anything. We are in the presence of universal law and\r\nshould bow our heads in silence and obey the Judge within, asking\r\nnothing, fearing nothing, just doing our duty right along, seeking no\r\nreward here or hereafter.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, more blessed to give than to receive. These dear good\r\nfriends would do for me and mine as I do for them were positions\r\nreversed. I am sure of this. Many precious acknowledgments have I\r\nreceived. Some venture to tell me they remember me every night in\r\ntheir prayers and ask for me every blessing. Often I cannot refrain\r\nfrom giving expression to my real feelings in return.\r\n\r\n\"Pray, don't,\" I say. \"Don't ask anything more for me. I've got far\r\nbeyond my just share already. Any fair committee sitting upon my case\r\nwould take away more than half the blessings already bestowed.\" These\r\nare not mere words, I feel their truth.\r\n\r\nThe Railroad Pension Fund is of a similar nature. Many of the old boys\r\nof the Pittsburgh Division (or their widows) are taken care of by it.\r\nIt began years ago and grew to its present proportions. It now\r\nbenefits the worthy railroad men who served under me when I was\r\nsuperintendent on the Pennsylvania, or their widows, who need help. I\r\nwas only a boy when I first went among these trainmen and got to know\r\nthem by name. They were very kind to me. Most of the men beneficiaries\r\nof the fund I have known personally. They are dear friends.\r\n\r\nAlthough the four-million-dollar fund I gave for workmen in the mills\r\n(Steel Workers' Pensions) embraces hundreds that I never saw, there\r\nare still a sufficient number upon it that I do remember to give that\r\nfund also a strong hold upon me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE PEACE PALACE AND PITTENCRIEFF\r\n\r\n\r\nPeace, at least as between English-speaking peoples,[55] must have\r\nbeen early in my thoughts. In 1869, when Britain launched the monster\r\nMonarch, then the largest warship known, there was, for some\r\nnow-forgotten reason, talk of how she could easily compel tribute from\r\nour American cities one after the other. Nothing could resist her. I\r\ncabled John Bright, then in the British Cabinet (the cable had\r\nrecently been opened):\r\n\r\n\"First and best service possible for Monarch, bringing home body\r\nPeabody.\"[56]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: \"Let men say what they will, I say that as surely as the\r\nsun in the heavens once shone upon Britain and America united, so\r\nsurely it is one morning to rise, shine upon, and greet again the\r\nReunited States--the British-American Union.\" (Quoted in Alderson's\r\n_Andrew Carnegie, The Man and His Work_, p. 108. New York, 1909.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: George Peabody, the American merchant and\r\nphilanthropist, who died in London in 1869.]\r\n\r\nNo signature was given. Strange to say, this was done, and thus the\r\nMonarch became the messenger of peace, not of destruction. Many years\r\nafterwards I met Mr. Bright at a small dinner party in Birmingham and\r\ntold him I was his young anonymous correspondent. He was surprised\r\nthat no signature was attached and said his heart was in the act. I am\r\nsure it was. He is entitled to all credit.\r\n\r\nHe was the friend of the Republic when she needed friends during the\r\nCivil War. He had always been my favorite living hero in public life\r\nas he had been my father's. Denounced as a wild radical at first, he\r\nkept steadily on until the nation came to his point of view. Always\r\nfor peace he would have avoided the Crimean War, in which Britain\r\nbacked the wrong horse, as Lord Salisbury afterwards acknowledged. It\r\nwas a great privilege that the Bright family accorded me, as a friend,\r\nto place a replica of the Manchester Bright statue in Parliament, in\r\nthe stead of a poor one removed.\r\n\r\nI became interested in the Peace Society of Great Britain upon one of\r\nmy early visits and attended many of its meetings, and in later days I\r\nwas especially drawn to the Parliamentary Union established by Mr.\r\nCremer, the famous working-man's representative in Parliament. Few men\r\nliving can be compared to Mr. Cremer. When he received the Nobel Prize\r\nof £8000 as the one who had done the most that year for peace, he\r\npromptly gave all but £1000, needed for pressing wants, to the\r\nArbitration Committee. It was a noble sacrifice. What is money but\r\ndross to the true hero! Mr. Cremer is paid a few dollars a week by his\r\ntrade to enable him to exist in London as their member of Parliament,\r\nand here was fortune thrown in his lap only to be devoted by him to\r\nthe cause of peace. This is the heroic in its finest form.\r\n\r\nI had the great pleasure of presenting the Committee to President\r\nCleveland at Washington in 1887, who received the members cordially\r\nand assured them of his hearty coöperation. From that day the\r\nabolition of war grew in importance with me until it finally\r\novershadowed all other issues. The surprising action of the first\r\nHague Conference gave me intense joy. Called primarily to consider\r\ndisarmament (which proved a dream), it created the commanding reality\r\nof a permanent tribunal to settle international disputes. I saw in\r\nthis the greatest step toward peace that humanity had ever taken, and\r\ntaken as if by inspiration, without much previous discussion. No\r\nwonder the sublime idea captivated the conference.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Holls, whose death I so deeply deplored, were alive to-day and\r\na delegate to the forthcoming second Conference with his chief, Andrew\r\nD. White, I feel that these two might possibly bring about the\r\ncreation of the needed International Court for the abolition of war.\r\nHe it was who started from The Hague at night for Germany, upon\r\nrequest of his chief, and saw the German Minister of Foreign Affairs,\r\nand the Emperor and finally prevailed upon them to approve of the High\r\nCourt, and not to withdraw their delegates as threatened--a service\r\nfor which Mr. Holls deserves to be enrolled among the greatest\r\nservants of mankind. Alas, death came to him while still in his prime.\r\n\r\nThe day that International Court is established will become one of the\r\nmost memorable days in the world's history.[57] It will ring the knell\r\nof man killing man--the deepest and blackest of crimes. It should be\r\ncelebrated in every land as I believe it will be some day, and that\r\ntime, perchance, not so remote as expected. In that era not a few of\r\nthose hitherto extolled as heroes will have found oblivion because\r\nthey failed to promote peace and good-will instead of war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: \"I submit that the only measure required to-day for the\r\nmaintenance of world peace is an agreement between three or four of\r\nthe leading Civilized Powers (and as many more as desire to join--the\r\nmore the better) pledged to coöperate against disturbers of world\r\npeace, should such arise.\" (Andrew Carnegie, in address at unveiling\r\nof a bust of William Randall Cremer at the Peace Palace of The Hague,\r\nAugust 29, 1913.)]\r\n\r\nWhen Andrew D. White and Mr. Holls, upon their return from The Hague,\r\nsuggested that I offer the funds needed for a Temple of Peace at The\r\nHague, I informed them that I never could be so presumptuous; that if\r\nthe Government of the Netherlands informed me of its desire to have\r\nsuch a temple and hoped I would furnish the means, the request would\r\nbe favorably considered. They demurred, saying this could hardly be\r\nexpected from any Government. Then I said I could never act in the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nFinally the Dutch Government did make application, through its\r\nMinister, Baron Gevers in Washington, and I rejoiced. Still, in\r\nwriting him, I was careful to say that the drafts of his Government\r\nwould be duly honored. I did not send the money. The Government drew\r\nupon me for it, and the draft for a million and a half is kept as a\r\nmemento. It seems to me almost too much that any individual should be\r\npermitted to perform so noble a duty as that of providing means for\r\nthis Temple of Peace--the most holy building in the world because it\r\nhas the holiest end in view. I do not even except St. Peter's, or any\r\nbuilding erected to the glory of God, whom, as Luther says, \"we cannot\r\nserve or aid; He needs no help from us.\" This temple is to bring\r\npeace, which is so greatly needed among His erring creatures. \"The\r\nhighest worship of God is service to man.\" At least, I feel so with\r\nLuther and Franklin.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1907 friends came and asked me to accept the presidency of the\r\nPeace Society of New York, which they had determined to organize, I\r\ndeclined, alleging that I was kept very busy with many affairs, which\r\nwas true; but my conscience troubled me afterwards for declining. If I\r\nwere not willing to sacrifice myself for the cause of peace what\r\nshould I sacrifice for? What was I good for? Fortunately, in a few\r\ndays, the Reverend Lyman Abbott, the Reverend Mr. Lynch, and some\r\nother notable laborers for good causes called to urge my\r\nreconsideration. I divined their errand and frankly told them they\r\nneed not speak. My conscience had been tormenting me for declining and\r\nI would accept the presidency and do my duty. After that came the\r\ngreat national gathering (the following April) when for the first time\r\nin the history of Peace Society meetings, there attended delegates\r\nfrom thirty-five of the states of the Union, besides many foreigners\r\nof distinction.[58]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: Mr. Carnegie does not mention the fact that in December,\r\n1910, he gave to a board of trustees $10,000,000, the revenue of which\r\nwas to be administered for \"the abolition of international war, the\r\nfoulest blot upon our civilization.\" This is known as the Carnegie\r\nEndowment for International Peace. The Honorable Elihu Root is\r\npresident of the board of trustees.]\r\n\r\nMy first decoration then came unexpectedly. The French Government had\r\nmade me Knight Commander of the Legion of Honor, and at the Peace\r\nBanquet in New York, over which I presided, Baron d'Estournelles de\r\nConstant appeared upon the stage and in a compelling speech invested\r\nme with the regalia amid the cheers of the company. It was a great\r\nhonor, indeed, and appreciated by me because given for my services to\r\nthe cause of International Peace. Such honors humble, they do not\r\nexalt; so let them come.[59] They serve also to remind me that I must\r\nstrive harder than ever, and watch every act and word more closely,\r\nthat I may reach just a little nearer the standard the givers--deluded\r\nsouls--mistakenly assume in their speeches, that I have already\r\nattained.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Mr. Carnegie received also the Grand Cross Order of\r\nOrange-Nassau from Holland, the Grand Cross Order of Danebrog from\r\nDenmark, a gold medal from twenty-one American Republics and had\r\ndoctors' degrees from innumerable universities and colleges. He was\r\nalso a member of many institutes, learned societies and clubs--over\r\n190 in number.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo gift I have made or can ever make can possibly approach that of\r\nPittencrieff Glen, Dunfermline. It is saturated with childish\r\nsentiment--all of the purest and sweetest. I must tell that story:\r\n\r\nAmong my earliest recollections are the struggles of Dunfermline to\r\nobtain the rights of the town to part of the Abbey grounds and the\r\nPalace ruins. My Grandfather Morrison began the campaign, or, at\r\nleast, was one of those who did. The struggle was continued by my\r\nUncles Lauder and Morrison, the latter honored by being charged with\r\nhaving incited and led a band of men to tear down a certain wall. The\r\ncitizens won a victory in the highest court and the then Laird ordered\r\nthat thereafter \"no Morrison be admitted to the Glen.\" I, being a\r\nMorrison like my brother-cousin, Dod, was debarred. The Lairds of\r\nPittencrieff for generations had been at variance with the\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe Glen is unique, as far as I know. It adjoins the Abbey and Palace\r\ngrounds, and on the west and north it lies along two of the main\r\nstreets of the town. Its area (between sixty and seventy acres) is\r\nfinely sheltered, its high hills grandly wooded. It always meant\r\nparadise to the child of Dunfermline. It certainly did to me. When I\r\nheard of paradise, I translated the word into Pittencrieff Glen,\r\nbelieving it to be as near to paradise as anything I could think of.\r\nHappy were we if through an open lodge gate, or over the wall or under\r\nthe iron grill over the burn, now and then we caught a glimpse inside.\r\n\r\nAlmost every Sunday Uncle Lauder took \"Dod\" and \"Naig\" for a walk\r\naround the Abbey to a part that overlooked the Glen--the busy crows\r\nfluttering around in the big trees below. Its Laird was to us children\r\nthe embodiment of rank and wealth. The Queen, we knew, lived in\r\nWindsor Castle, but she didn't own Pittencrieff, not she! Hunt of\r\nPittencrieff wouldn't exchange with her or with any one. Of this we\r\nwere sure, because certainly neither of us would. In all my\r\nchildhood's--yes and in my early manhood's--air-castle building (which\r\nwas not small), nothing comparable in grandeur approached\r\nPittencrieff. My Uncle Lauder predicted many things for me when I\r\nbecame a man, but had he foretold that some day I should be rich\r\nenough, and so supremely fortunate as to become Laird of Pittencrieff,\r\nhe might have turned my head. And then to be able to hand it over to\r\nDunfermline as a public park--my paradise of childhood! Not for a\r\ncrown would I barter that privilege.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Ross whispered to me that Colonel Hunt might be induced to\r\nsell, my ears cocked themselves instantly. He wished an extortionate\r\nprice, the doctor thought, and I heard nothing further for some time.\r\nWhen indisposed in London in the autumn of 1902, my mind ran upon the\r\nsubject, and I intended to wire Dr. Ross to come up and see me. One\r\nmorning, Mrs. Carnegie came into my room and asked me to guess who had\r\narrived and I guessed Dr. Ross. Sure enough, there he was. We talked\r\nover Pittencrieff. I suggested that if our mutual friend and\r\nfellow-townsman, Mr. Shaw in Edinburgh (Lord Shaw of Dunfermline) ever\r\nmet Colonel Hunt's agents he could intimate that their client might\r\nsome day regret not closing with me as another purchaser equally\r\nanxious to buy might not be met with, and I might change my mind or\r\npass away. Mr. Shaw told the doctor when he mentioned this that he had\r\nan appointment to meet with Hunt's lawyer on other business the next\r\nmorning and would certainly say so.\r\n\r\nI sailed shortly after for New York and received there one day a cable\r\nfrom Mr. Shaw stating that the Laird would accept forty-five thousand\r\npounds. Should he close? I wired: \"Yes, provided it is under Ross's\r\nconditions\"; and on Christmas Eve, I received Shaw's reply: \"Hail,\r\nLaird of Pittencrieff!\" So I was the happy possessor of the grandest\r\ntitle on earth in my estimation. The King--well, he was only the King.\r\nHe didn't own King Malcolm's tower nor St. Margaret's shrine, nor\r\nPittencrieff Glen. Not he, poor man. I did, and I shall be glad to\r\ncondescendingly show the King those treasures should he ever visit\r\nDunfermline.\r\n\r\nAs the possessor of the Park and the Glen I had a chance to find out\r\nwhat, if anything, money could do for the good of the masses of a\r\ncommunity, if placed in the hands of a body of public-spirited\r\ncitizens. Dr. Ross was taken into my confidence so far as Pittencrieff\r\nPark was concerned, and with his advice certain men intended for a\r\nbody of trustees were agreed upon and invited to Skibo to organize.\r\nThey imagined it was in regard to transferring the Park to the town;\r\nnot even to Dr. Ross was any other subject mentioned. When they heard\r\nthat half a million sterling in bonds, bearing five per cent interest,\r\nwas also to go to them for the benefit of Dunfermline, they were\r\nsurprised.[60]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: Additional gifts, made later, brought this gift up to\r\n$3,750,000.]\r\n\r\nIt is twelve years since the Glen was handed over to the trustees and\r\ncertainly no public park was ever dearer to a people. The children's\r\nyearly gala day, the flower shows and the daily use of the Park by the\r\npeople are surprising. The Glen now attracts people from neighboring\r\ntowns. In numerous ways the trustees have succeeded finely in the\r\ndirection indicated in the trust deed, namely:\r\n\r\n     To bring into the monotonous lives of the toiling masses of\r\n     Dunfermline, more \"of sweetness and light,\" to give to\r\n     them--especially the young--some charm, some happiness, some\r\n     elevating conditions of life which residence elsewhere would\r\n     have denied, that the child of my native town, looking back\r\n     in after years, however far from home it may have roamed,\r\n     will feel that simply by virtue of being such, life has been\r\n     made happier and better. If this be the fruit of your\r\n     labors, you will have succeeded; if not, you will have\r\n     failed.\r\n\r\nTo this paragraph I owe the friendship of Earl Grey, formerly\r\nGovernor-General of Canada. He wrote Dr. Ross:\r\n\r\n\"I must know the man who wrote that document in the 'Times' this\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\nWe met in London and became instantly sympathetic. He is a great soul\r\nwho passes instantly into the heart and stays there. Lord Grey is also\r\nto-day a member (trustee) of the ten-million-dollar fund for the\r\nUnited Kingdom.[61]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: Mr. Carnegie refers to the gift of ten million dollars\r\nto the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust merely in connection with Earl\r\nGrey. His references to his gifts are casual, in that he refers only\r\nto the ones in which he happens for the moment to be interested. Those\r\nhe mentions are merely a part of the whole. He gave to the Church\r\nPeace Union over $2,000,000, to the United Engineering Society\r\n$1,500,000, to the International Bureau of American Republics\r\n$850,000, and to a score or more of research, hospital, and\r\neducational boards sums ranging from $100,000 to $500,000. He gave to\r\nvarious towns and cities over twenty-eight hundred library buildings\r\nat a cost of over $60,000,000. The largest of his gifts he does not\r\nmention at all. This was made in 1911 to the Carnegie Corporation of\r\nNew York and was $125,000,000. The Corporation is the residuary\r\nlegatee under Mr. Carnegie's will and it is not yet known what further\r\nsum may come to it through that instrument. The object of the\r\nCorporation, as defined by Mr. Carnegie himself in a letter to the\r\ntrustees, is:\r\n\r\n\"To promote the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and\r\nunderstanding among the people of the United States by aiding\r\ntechnical schools, institutions of higher learning, libraries,\r\nscientific research, hero funds, useful publications and by such other\r\nagencies and means as shall from time to time be found appropriate\r\ntherefor.\"\r\n\r\nThe Carnegie benefactions, all told, amount to something over\r\n$350,000,000--surely a huge sum to have been brought together and then\r\ndistributed by one man.]\r\n\r\nThus, Pittencrieff Glen is the most soul-satisfying public gift I ever\r\nmade, or ever can make. It is poetic justice that the grandson of\r\nThomas Morrison, radical leader in his day, nephew of Bailie Morrison,\r\nhis son and successor, and above all son of my sainted father and my\r\nmost heroic mother, should arise and dispossess the lairds, should\r\nbecome the agent for conveying the Glen and Park to the people of\r\nDunfermline forever. It is a true romance, which no air-castle can\r\nquite equal or fiction conceive. The hand of destiny seems to hover\r\nover it, and I hear something whispering: \"Not altogether in vain have\r\nyou lived--not altogether in vain.\" This is the crowning mercy of my\r\ncareer! I set it apart from all my other public gifts. Truly the\r\nwhirligig of time brings in some strange revenges.\r\n\r\nIt is now thirteen years since I ceased to accumulate wealth and began\r\nto distribute it. I could never have succeeded in either had I stopped\r\nwith having enough to retire upon, but nothing to retire to. But there\r\nwas the habit and the love of reading, writing and speaking upon\r\noccasion, and also the acquaintance and friendship of educated men\r\nwhich I had made before I gave up business. For some years after\r\nretiring I could not force myself to visit the works. This, alas,\r\nwould recall so many who had gone before. Scarcely one of my early\r\nfriends would remain to give me the hand-clasp of the days of old.\r\nOnly one or two of these old men would call me \"Andy.\"\r\n\r\nDo not let it be thought, however, that my younger partners were\r\nforgotten, or that they have not played a very important part in\r\nsustaining me in the effort of reconciling myself to the new\r\nconditions. Far otherwise! The most soothing influence of all was\r\ntheir prompt organization of the Carnegie Veteran Association, to\r\nexpire only when the last member dies. Our yearly dinner together, in\r\nour own home in New York, is a source of the greatest pleasure,--so\r\ngreat that it lasts from one year to the other. Some of the Veterans\r\ntravel far to be present, and what occurs between us constitutes one\r\nof the dearest joys of my life. I carry with me the affection of \"my\r\nboys.\" I am certain I do. There is no possible mistake about that\r\nbecause my heart goes out to them. This I number among my many\r\nblessings and in many a brooding hour this fact comes to me, and I say\r\nto myself: \"Rather this, minus fortune, than multi-millionairedom\r\nwithout it--yes, a thousand times, yes.\"\r\n\r\nMany friends, great and good men and women, Mrs. Carnegie and I are\r\nfavored to know, but not one whit shall these ever change our joint\r\nlove for the \"boys.\" For to my infinite delight her heart goes out to\r\nthem as does mine. She it was who christened our new New York home\r\nwith the first Veteran dinner. \"The partners first\" was her word. It\r\nwas no mere idle form when they elected Mrs. Carnegie the first\r\nhonorary member, and our daughter the second. Their place in our\r\nhearts is secure. Although I was the senior, still we were \"boys\r\ntogether.\" Perfect trust and common aims, not for self only, but for\r\neach other, and deep affection, moulded us into a brotherhood. We were\r\nfriends first and partners afterwards. Forty-three out of forty-five\r\npartners are thus bound together for life.\r\n\r\nAnother yearly event that brings forth many choice spirits is our\r\nLiterary Dinner, at home, our dear friend Mr. Richard Watson Gilder,\r\neditor of the \"Century,\" being the manager.[62] His devices and\r\nquotations from the writings of the guest of the year, placed upon\r\nthe cards of the guests, are so appropriate, as to cause much\r\nhilarity. Then the speeches of the novitiates give zest to the\r\noccasion. John Morley was the guest of honor when with us in 1895 and\r\na quotation from his works was upon the card at each plate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: \"Yesterday we had a busy day in Toronto. The grand event\r\nwas a dinner at six o'clock where we all spoke, A.C. making a\r\nremarkable address.... I can't tell you how I am enjoying this. Not\r\nonly seeing new places, but the talks with our own party. It is,\r\nindeed, a liberal education. A.C. is truly a 'great' man; that is, a\r\nman of enormous faculty and a great imagination. I don't remember any\r\nfriend who has such a range of poetical quotation, unless it is\r\nStedman. (Not so much _range_ as numerous quotations from Shakespeare,\r\nBurns, Byron, etc.) His views are truly large and prophetic. And,\r\nunless I am mistaken, he has a genuine ethical character. He is not\r\nperfect, but he is most interesting and remarkable; a true democrat;\r\nhis benevolent actions having a root in principle and character. He is\r\nnot accidentally the intimate friend of such high natures as Arnold\r\nand Morley.\" (_Letters of Richard Watson Gilder_, edited by his\r\ndaughter Rosamond Gilder, p. 374. New York, 1916.)]\r\n\r\nOne year Gilder appeared early in the evening of the dinner as he\r\nwished to seat the guests. This had been done, but he came to me\r\nsaying it was well he had looked them over. He had found John\r\nBurroughs and Ernest Thompson Seton were side by side, and as they\r\nwere then engaged in a heated controversy upon the habits of beasts\r\nand birds, in which both had gone too far in their criticisms, they\r\nwere at dagger's points. Gilder said it would never do to seat them\r\ntogether. He had separated them. I said nothing, but slipped into the\r\ndining-room unobserved and replaced the cards as before. Gilder's\r\nsurprise was great when he saw the men next each other, but the result\r\nwas just as I had expected. A reconciliation took place and they\r\nparted good friends. Moral: If you wish to play peace-maker, seat\r\nadversaries next each other where they must begin by being civil.\r\n\r\nBurroughs and Seton both enjoyed the trap I set for them. True it is,\r\nwe only hate those whom we do not know. It certainly is often the way\r\nto peace to invite your adversary to dinner and even beseech him to\r\ncome, taking no refusal. Most quarrels become acute from the parties\r\nnot seeing and communicating with each other and hearing too much of\r\ntheir disagreement from others. They do not fully understand the\r\nother's point of view and all that can be said for it. Wise is he who\r\noffers the hand of reconciliation should a difference with a friend\r\narise. Unhappy he to the end of his days who refuses it. No possible\r\ngain atones for the loss of one who has been a friend even if that\r\nfriend has become somewhat less dear to you than before. He is still\r\none with whom you have been intimate, and as age comes on friends pass\r\nrapidly away and leave you.\r\n\r\nHe is the happy man who feels there is not a human being to whom he\r\ndoes not wish happiness, long life, and deserved success, not one in\r\nwhose path he would cast an obstacle nor to whom he would not do a\r\nservice if in his power. All this he can feel without being called\r\nupon to retain as a friend one who has proved unworthy beyond question\r\nby dishonorable conduct. For such there should be nothing felt but\r\npity, infinite pity. And pity for your own loss also, for true\r\nfriendship can only feed and grow upon the virtues.\r\n\r\n    \"When love begins to sicken and decay\r\n    It useth an enforced ceremony.\"\r\n\r\nThe former geniality may be gone forever, but each can wish the other\r\nnothing but happiness.\r\n\r\nNone of my friends hailed my retirement from business more warmly than\r\nMark Twain. I received from him the following note, at a time when the\r\nnewspapers were talking much about my wealth.\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR AND FRIEND:\r\n\r\n     You seem to be prosperous these days. Could you lend an\r\n     admirer a dollar and a half to buy a hymn-book with? God\r\n     will bless you if you do; I feel it, I know it. So will I.\r\n     If there should be other applications this one not to count.\r\n\r\n     Yours\r\n\r\n     MARK\r\n\r\n     P.S. Don't send the hymn-book, send the money. I want to\r\n     make the selection myself.\r\n\r\n     M.\r\n\r\nWhen he was lying ill in New York I went to see him frequently, and we\r\nhad great times together, for even lying in bed he was as bright as\r\never. One call was to say good-bye, before my sailing for Scotland.\r\nThe Pension Fund for University Professors was announced in New York\r\nsoon after I sailed. A letter about it from Mark, addressed to \"Saint\r\nAndrew,\" reached me in Scotland, from which I quote the following:\r\n\r\n     You can take my halo. If you had told me what you had done\r\n     when at my bedside you would have got it there and then. It\r\n     is pure tin and paid \"the duty\" when it came down.\r\n\r\nThose intimate with Mr. Clemens (Mark Twain) will certify that he was\r\none of the charmers. Joe Jefferson is the only man who can be conceded\r\nhis twin brother in manner and speech, their charm being of the same\r\nkind. \"Uncle Remus\" (Joel Chandler Harris) is another who has charm,\r\nand so has George W. Cable; yes, and Josh Billings also had it. Such\r\npeople brighten the lives of their friends, regardless of themselves.\r\nThey make sunshine wherever they go. In Rip Van Winkle's words: \"All\r\npretty much alike, dem fellers.\" Every one of them is unselfish and\r\nwarm of heart.\r\n\r\nThe public only knows one side of Mr. Clemens--the amusing part.\r\nLittle does it suspect that he was a man of strong convictions upon\r\npolitical and social questions and a moralist of no mean order. For\r\ninstance, upon the capture of Aguinaldo by deception, his pen was the\r\nmost trenchant of all. Junius was weak in comparison.\r\n\r\nThe gathering to celebrate his seventieth birthday was unique. The\r\nliterary element was there in force, but Mark had not forgotten to ask\r\nto have placed near him the multi-millionaire, Mr. H.H. Rogers, one\r\nwho had been his friend in need. Just like Mark. Without exception,\r\nthe leading literary men dwelt in their speeches exclusively upon the\r\nguest's literary work. When my turn came, I referred to this and asked\r\nthem to note that what our friend had done as a man would live as long\r\nas what he had written. Sir Walter Scott and he were linked\r\nindissolubly together. Our friend, like Scott, was ruined by the\r\nmistakes of partners, who had become hopelessly bankrupt. Two courses\r\nlay before him. One the smooth, easy, and short way--the legal path.\r\nSurrender all your property, go through bankruptcy, and start afresh.\r\nThis was all he owed to creditors. The other path, long, thorny, and\r\ndreary, a life struggle, with everything sacrificed. There lay the two\r\npaths and this was his decision:\r\n\r\n\"Not what I owe to my creditors, but what I owe to myself is the\r\nissue.\"\r\n\r\nThere are times in most men's lives that test whether they be dross or\r\npure gold. It is the decision made in the crisis which proves the man.\r\nOur friend entered the fiery furnace a man and emerged a hero. He paid\r\nhis debts to the utmost farthing by lecturing around the world. \"An\r\namusing cuss, Mark Twain,\" is all very well as a popular verdict, but\r\nwhat of Mr. Clemens the man and the hero, for he is both and in the\r\nfront rank, too, with Sir Walter.\r\n\r\nHe had a heroine in his wife. She it was who sustained him and\r\ntraveled the world round with him as his guardian angel, and enabled\r\nhim to conquer as Sir Walter did. This he never failed to tell to his\r\nintimates. Never in my life did three words leave so keen a pang as\r\nthose uttered upon my first call after Mrs. Clemens passed away. I\r\nfortunately found him alone and while my hand was still in his, and\r\nbefore one word had been spoken by either, there came from him, with a\r\nstronger pressure of my hand, these words: \"A ruined home, a ruined\r\nhome.\" The silence was unbroken. I write this years after, but still I\r\nhear the words again and my heart responds.\r\n\r\nOne mercy, denied to our forefathers, comes to us of to-day. If the\r\nJudge within give us a verdict of acquittal as having lived this life\r\nwell, we have no other Judge to fear.\r\n\r\n          \"To thine own self be true,\r\n    And it must follow, as the night the day,\r\n    Thou canst not then be false to any man.\"\r\n\r\nEternal punishment, because of a few years' shortcomings here on\r\nearth, would be the reverse of Godlike. Satan himself would recoil\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nMATHEW ARNOLD AND OTHERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most charming man, John Morley and I agree, that we ever knew was\r\nMatthew Arnold. He had, indeed, \"a charm\"--that is the only word which\r\nexpresses the effect of his presence and his conversation. Even his\r\nlook and grave silences charmed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photograph from Underwood & Underwood, N.Y._\r\n\r\nMATTHEW ARNOLD]\r\n\r\nHe coached with us in 1880, I think, through Southern England--William\r\nBlack and Edwin A. Abbey being of the party. Approaching a pretty\r\nvillage he asked me if the coach might stop there a few minutes. He\r\nexplained that this was the resting-place of his godfather, Bishop\r\nKeble, and he should like to visit his grave. He continued:\r\n\r\n\"Ah, dear, dear Keble! I caused him much sorrow by my views upon\r\ntheological subjects, which caused me sorrow also, but notwithstanding\r\nhe was deeply grieved, dear friend as he was, he traveled to Oxford\r\nand voted for me for Professor of English Poetry.\"\r\n\r\nWe walked to the quiet churchyard together. Matthew Arnold in silent\r\nthought at the grave of Keble made upon me a lasting impression. Later\r\nthe subject of his theological views was referred to. He said they had\r\ncaused sorrow to his best friends.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gladstone once gave expression to his deep disappointment, or to\r\nsomething like displeasure, saying I ought to have been a bishop. No\r\ndoubt my writings prevented my promotion, as well as grieved my\r\nfriends, but I could not help it. I had to express my views.\"\r\n\r\nI remember well the sadness of tone with which these last words\r\nwere spoken, and how very slowly. They came as from the deep. He had\r\nhis message to deliver. Steadily has the age advanced to receive it.\r\nHis teachings pass almost uncensured to-day. If ever there was a\r\nseriously religious man it was Matthew Arnold. No irreverent word ever\r\nescaped his lips. In this he and Gladstone were equally above\r\nreproach, and yet he had in one short sentence slain the supernatural.\r\n\"The case against miracles is closed. They do not happen.\"\r\n\r\nHe and his daughter, now Mrs. Whitridge, were our guests when in New\r\nYork in 1883, and also at our mountain home in the Alleghanies, so\r\nthat I saw a great deal, but not enough, of him. My mother and myself\r\ndrove him to the hall upon his first public appearance in New York.\r\nNever was there a finer audience gathered. The lecture was not a\r\nsuccess, owing solely to his inability to speak well in public. He was\r\nnot heard. When we returned home his first words were:\r\n\r\n\"Well, what have you all to say? Tell me! Will I do as a lecturer?\"\r\n\r\nI was so keenly interested in his success that I did not hesitate to\r\ntell him it would never do for him to go on unless he fitted himself\r\nfor public speaking. He must get an elocutionist to give him lessons\r\nupon two or three points. I urged this so strongly that he consented\r\nto do so. After we all had our say, he turned to my mother, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Now, dear Mrs. Carnegie, they have all given me their opinions, but I\r\nwish to know what you have to say about my first night as a lecturer\r\nin America.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too ministerial, Mr. Arnold, too ministerial,\" was the reply slowly\r\nand softly delivered. And to the last Mr. Arnold would occasionally\r\nrefer to that, saying he felt it hit the nail on the head. When he\r\nreturned to New York from his Western tour, he had so much improved\r\nthat his voice completely filled the Brooklyn Academy of Music. He had\r\ntaken a few lessons from a professor of elocution in Boston, as\r\nadvised, and all went well thereafter.\r\n\r\nHe expressed a desire to hear the noted preacher, Mr. Beecher; and we\r\nstarted for Brooklyn one Sunday morning. Mr. Beecher had been apprized\r\nof our coming so that after the services he might remain to meet Mr.\r\nArnold. When I presented Mr. Arnold he was greeted warmly. Mr. Beecher\r\nexpressed his delight at meeting one in the flesh whom he had long\r\nknown so well in the spirit, and, grasping his hand, he said:\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing you have written, Mr. Arnold, which I have not\r\ncarefully read at least once and a great deal many times, and always\r\nwith profit, always with profit!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, then, I fear, Mr. Beecher,\" replied Arnold, \"you may have found\r\nsome references to yourself which would better have been omitted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, no, those did me the most good of all,\" said the smiling\r\nBeecher, and they both laughed.\r\n\r\nMr. Beecher was never at a loss. After presenting Matthew Arnold to\r\nhim, I had the pleasure of presenting the daughter of Colonel\r\nIngersoll, saying, as I did so:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Beecher, this is the first time Miss Ingersoll has ever been in a\r\nChristian church.\"\r\n\r\nHe held out both hands and grasped hers, and looking straight at her\r\nand speaking slowly, said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, you are the most beautiful heathen I ever saw.\" Those who\r\nremember Miss Ingersoll in her youth will not differ greatly with Mr.\r\nBeecher. Then: \"How's your father, Miss Ingersoll? I hope he's well.\r\nMany a time he and I have stood together on the platform, and wasn't\r\nit lucky for me we were on the same side!\"\r\n\r\nBeecher was, indeed, a great, broad, generous man, who absorbed what\r\nwas good wherever found. Spencer's philosophy, Arnold's insight\r\ntempered with sound sense, Ingersoll's staunch support of high\r\npolitical ends were powers for good in the Republic. Mr. Beecher was\r\ngreat enough to appreciate and hail as helpful friends all of these\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nArnold visited us in Scotland in 1887, and talking one day of sport he\r\nsaid he did not shoot, he could not kill anything that had wings and\r\ncould soar in the clear blue sky; but, he added, he could not give up\r\nfishing--\"the accessories are so delightful.\" He told of his happiness\r\nwhen a certain duke gave him a day's fishing twice or three times a\r\nyear. I forget who the kind duke was, but there was something unsavory\r\nabout him and mention was made of this. He was asked how he came to be\r\nupon intimate terms with such a man.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" he said, \"a duke is always a personage with us, always a\r\npersonage, independent of brains or conduct. We are all snobs.\r\nHundreds of years have made us so, all snobs. We can't help it. It is\r\nin the blood.\"\r\n\r\nThis was smilingly said, and I take it he made some mental\r\nreservations. He was no snob himself, but one who naturally \"smiled at\r\nthe claims of long descent,\" for generally the \"descent\" cannot be\r\nquestioned.\r\n\r\nHe was interested, however, in men of rank and wealth, and I remember\r\nwhen in New York he wished particularly to meet Mr. Vanderbilt. I\r\nventured to say he would not find him different from other men.\r\n\r\n\"No, but it is something to know the richest man in the world,\" he\r\nreplied. \"Certainly the man who makes his own wealth eclipses those\r\nwho inherit rank from others.\"\r\n\r\nI asked him one day why he had never written critically upon\r\nShakespeare and assigned him his place upon the throne among the\r\npoets. He said that thoughts of doing so had arisen, but reflection\r\nalways satisfied him that he was incompetent to write upon, much less\r\nto criticize, Shakespeare. He believed it could not be successfully\r\ndone. Shakespeare was above all, could be measured by no rules of\r\ncriticism; and much as he should have liked to dwell upon his\r\ntranscendent genius, he had always recoiled from touching the subject.\r\nI said that I was prepared for this, after his tribute which stands\r\nto-day unequaled, and I recalled his own lines from his sonnet:\r\n\r\n    SHAKESPEARE\r\n\r\n    Others abide our question. Thou art free.\r\n    We ask and ask--Thou smilest and art still,\r\n    Out-topping knowledge. For the loftiest hill\r\n    Who to the stars uncrowns his majesty,\r\n\r\n    Planting his steadfast footsteps in the sea,\r\n    Making the heaven of heavens his dwelling-place,\r\n    Spares but the cloudy border of his base\r\n    To the foil'd searching of mortality;\r\n\r\n    And thou, who didst the stars and sunbeams know,\r\n    Self-school'd, self-scann'd, self-honour'd, self-secure,\r\n    Didst stand on earth unguess'd at--Better so!\r\n\r\n    All pains the immortal spirit must endure,\r\n    All weakness which impairs, all griefs which bow,\r\n    Find their sole voice in that victorious brow.\r\n\r\nI knew Mr. Shaw (Josh Billings) and wished Mr. Arnold, the apostle of\r\nsweetness and light, to meet that rough diamond--rough, but still a\r\ndiamond. Fortunately one morning Josh came to see me in the Windsor\r\nHotel, where we were then living, and referred to our guest,\r\nexpressing his admiration for him. I replied:\r\n\r\n\"You are going to dine with him to-night. The ladies are going out and\r\nArnold and myself are to dine alone; you complete the trinity.\"\r\n\r\nTo this he demurred, being a modest man, but I was inexorable. No\r\nexcuse would be taken; he must come to oblige me. He did. I sat\r\nbetween them at dinner and enjoyed this meeting of extremes. Mr.\r\nArnold became deeply interested in Mr. Shaw's way of putting things\r\nand liked his Western anecdotes, laughing more heartily than I had\r\never seen him do before. One incident after another was told from the\r\nexperience of the lecturer, for Mr. Shaw had lectured for fifteen\r\nyears in every place of ten thousand inhabitants or more in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nMr. Arnold was desirous of hearing how the lecturer held his\r\naudiences.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, \"you mustn't keep them laughing too long, or they\r\nwill think you are laughing at them. After giving the audience\r\namusement you must become earnest and play the serious rôle. For\r\ninstance, 'There are two things in this life for which no man is ever\r\nprepared. Who will tell me what these are?' Finally some one cries out\r\n'Death.' 'Well, who gives me the other?' Many respond--wealth,\r\nhappiness, strength, marriage, taxes. At last Josh begins, solemnly:\r\n'None of you has given the second. There are two things on earth for\r\nwhich no man is ever prepared, and them's twins,' and the house\r\nshakes.\" Mr. Arnold did also.\r\n\r\n\"Do you keep on inventing new stories?\" was asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, always. You can't lecture year after year unless you find new\r\nstories, and sometimes these fail to crack. I had one nut which I felt\r\nsure would crack and bring down the house, but try as I would it never\r\ndid itself justice, all because I could not find the indispensable\r\nword, just one word. I was sitting before a roaring wood fire one\r\nnight up in Michigan when the word came to me which I knew would crack\r\nlike a whip. I tried it on the boys and it did. It lasted longer than\r\nany one word I used. I began: 'This is a highly critical age. People\r\nwon't believe until they fully understand. Now there's Jonah and the\r\nwhale. They want to know all about it, and it's my opinion that\r\nneither Jonah nor the whale fully understood it. And then they ask\r\nwhat Jonah was doing in the whale's--the whale's society.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Shaw was walking down Broadway one day when accosted by a real\r\nWesterner, who said:\r\n\r\n\"I think you are Josh Billings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sometimes I am called that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have five thousand dollars for you right here in my pocket-book.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here's Delmonico's, come in and tell me all about it.\"\r\n\r\nAfter seating themselves, the stranger said he was part owner in a\r\ngold mine in California, and explained that there had been a dispute\r\nabout its ownership and that the conference of partners broke up in\r\nquarreling. The stranger said he had left, threatening he would take\r\nthe bull by the horns and begin legal proceedings. \"The next morning I\r\nwent to the meeting and told them I had turned over Josh Billings's\r\nalmanac that morning and the lesson for the day was: 'When you take\r\nthe bull by the horns, take him by the tail; you can get a better hold\r\nand let go when you're a mind to.' We laughed and laughed and felt\r\nthat was good sense. We took your advice, settled, and parted good\r\nfriends. Some one moved that five thousand dollars be given Josh, and\r\nas I was coming East they appointed me treasurer and I promised to\r\nhand it over. There it is.\"\r\n\r\nThe evening ended by Mr. Arnold saying:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Shaw, if ever you come to lecture in England, I shall be\r\nglad to welcome and introduce you to your first audience. Any foolish\r\nman called a lord could do you more good than I by introducing you,\r\nbut I should so much like to do it.\"\r\n\r\nImagine Matthew Arnold, the apostle of sweetness and light,\r\nintroducing Josh Billings, the foremost of jesters, to a select London\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nIn after years he never failed to ask after \"our leonine friend, Mr.\r\nShaw.\"\r\n\r\nMeeting Josh at the Windsor one morning after the notable dinner I sat\r\ndown with him in the rotunda and he pulled out a small memorandum\r\nbook, saying as he did so:\r\n\r\n\"Where's Arnold? I wonder what he would say to this. The 'Century'\r\ngives me $100 a week, I agreeing to send them any trifle that occurs\r\nto me. I try to give it something. Here's this from Uncle Zekiel, my\r\nweekly budget: 'Of course the critic is a greater man than the author.\r\nAny fellow who can point out the mistakes another fellow has made is a\r\ndarned sight smarter fellow than the fellow who made them.'\"\r\n\r\nI told Mr. Arnold a Chicago story, or rather a story about Chicago. A\r\nsociety lady of Boston visiting her schoolmate friend in Chicago, who\r\nwas about to be married, was overwhelmed with attention. Asked by a\r\nnoted citizen one evening what had charmed her most in Chicago, she\r\ngraciously replied:\r\n\r\n\"What surprises me most isn't the bustle of business, or your\r\nremarkable development materially, or your grand residences; it is the\r\ndegree of culture and refinement I find here.\" The response promptly\r\ncame:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we are just dizzy on cult out here, you bet.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Arnold was not prepared to enjoy Chicago, which had impressed him\r\nas the headquarters of Philistinism. He was, however, surprised and\r\ngratified at meeting with so much \"culture and refinement.\" Before he\r\nstarted he was curious to know what he should find most interesting. I\r\nlaughingly said that he would probably first be taken to see the most\r\nwonderful sight there, which was said to be the slaughter houses, with\r\nnew machines so perfected that the hog driven in at one end came out\r\nhams at the other before its squeal was out of one's ears. Then after\r\na pause he asked reflectively:\r\n\r\n\"But why should one go to slaughter houses, why should one hear hogs\r\nsqueal?\" I could give no reason, so the matter rested.\r\n\r\nMr. Arnold's Old Testament favorite was certainly Isaiah: at least his\r\nfrequent quotations from that great poet, as he called him, led one to\r\nthis conclusion. I found in my tour around the world that the sacred\r\nbooks of other religions had been stripped of the dross that had\r\nnecessarily accumulated around their legends. I remembered Mr. Arnold\r\nsaying that the Scriptures should be so dealt with. The gems from\r\nConfucius and others which delight the world have been selected with\r\nmuch care and appear as \"collects.\" The disciple has not the\r\nobjectionable accretions of the ignorant past presented to him.\r\n\r\nThe more one thinks over the matter, the stronger one's opinion\r\nbecomes that the Christian will have to follow the Eastern example and\r\nwinnow the wheat from the chaff--worse than chaff, sometimes the\r\npositively pernicious and even poisonous refuse. Burns, in the\r\n\"Cotter's Saturday Night,\" pictures the good man taking down the big\r\nBible for the evening service:\r\n\r\n    \"He wales a portion with judicious care.\"\r\n\r\nWe should have those portions selected and use the selections only. In\r\nthis, and much besides, the man whom I am so thankful for having known\r\nand am so favored as to call friend, has proved the true teacher in\r\nadvance of his age, the greatest poetic teacher in the domain of \"the\r\nfuture and its viewless things.\"\r\n\r\nI took Arnold down from our summer home at Cresson in the Alleghanies\r\nto see black, smoky Pittsburgh. In the path from the Edgar Thomson\r\nSteel Works to the railway station there are two flights of steps to\r\nthe bridge across the railway, the second rather steep. When we had\r\nascended about three quarters of it he suddenly stopped to gain\r\nbreath. Leaning upon the rail and putting his hand upon his heart, he\r\nsaid to me:\r\n\r\n\"Ah, this will some day do for me, as it did for my father.\"\r\n\r\nI did not know then of the weakness of his heart, but I never forgot\r\nthis incident, and when not long after the sad news came of his sudden\r\ndeath, after exertion in England endeavoring to evade an obstacle, it\r\ncame back to me with a great pang that our friend had foretold his\r\nfate. Our loss was great. To no man I have known could Burns's epitaph\r\nupon Tam Samson be more appropriately applied:\r\n\r\n    \"Tam Samson's weel-worn clay here lies:\r\n    Ye canting zealots, spare him!\r\n    If honest worth in heaven rise,\r\n    Ye'll mend or ye win near him.\"\r\n\r\nThe name of a dear man comes to me just here, Dr. Oliver Wendell\r\nHolmes, of Boston, everybody's doctor, whose only ailment toward the\r\nend was being eighty years of age. He was a boy to the last. When\r\nMatthew Arnold died a few friends could not resist taking steps toward\r\na suitable memorial to his memory. These friends quietly provided the\r\nnecessary sum, as no public appeal could be thought of. No one could\r\nbe permitted to contribute to such a fund except such as had a right\r\nto the privilege, for privilege it was felt to be. Double, triple the\r\nsum could readily have been obtained. I had the great satisfaction of\r\nbeing permitted to join the select few and to give the matter a little\r\nattention upon our side of the Atlantic. Of course I never thought of\r\nmentioning the matter to dear Dr. Holmes--not that he was not one of\r\nthe elect, but that no author or professional man should be asked to\r\ncontribute money to funds which, with rare exceptions, are best\r\nemployed when used for themselves. One morning, however, I received a\r\nnote from the doctor, saying that it had been whispered to him that\r\nthere was such a movement on foot, and that I had been mentioned in\r\nconnection with it, and if he were judged worthy to have his name upon\r\nthe roll of honor, he would be gratified. Since he had heard of it he\r\ncould not rest without writing to me, and he should like to hear in\r\nreply. That he was thought worthy goes without saying.\r\n\r\nThis is the kind of memorial any man might wish. I venture to say that\r\nthere was not one who contributed to it who was not grateful to the\r\nkind fates for giving him the opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nBRITISH POLITICAL LEADERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn London, Lord Rosebery, then in Gladstone's Cabinet and a rising\r\nstatesman, was good enough to invite me to dine with him to meet Mr.\r\nGladstone, and I am indebted to him for meeting the world's first\r\ncitizen. This was, I think, in 1885, for my \"Triumphant Democracy\"[63]\r\nappeared in 1886, and I remember giving Mr. Gladstone, upon that\r\noccasion, some startling figures which I had prepared for it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: _Triumphant Democracy, or Fifty Years' March of the\r\nRepublic._ London and New York, 1886.]\r\n\r\nI never did what I thought right in a social matter with greater\r\nself-denial, than when later the first invitation came from Mr.\r\nGladstone to dine with him. I was engaged to dine elsewhere and sorely\r\ntempted to plead that an invitation from the real ruler of Great\r\nBritain should be considered as much of a command as that of the\r\nornamental dignitary. But I kept my engagement and missed the man I\r\nmost wished to meet. The privilege came later, fortunately, when\r\nsubsequent visits to him at Hawarden were made.\r\n\r\nLord Rosebery opened the first library I ever gave, that of\r\nDunfermline, and he has recently (1905) opened the latest given by\r\nme--one away over in Stornoway. When he last visited New York I drove\r\nhim along the Riverside Drive, and he declared that no city in the\r\nworld possessed such an attraction. He was a man of brilliant parts,\r\nbut his resolutions were\r\n\r\n    \"Sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought.\"\r\n\r\nHad he been born to labor and entered the House of Commons in youth,\r\ninstead of being dropped without effort into the gilded upper chamber,\r\nhe might have acquired in the rough-and-tumble of life the tougher\r\nskin, for he was highly sensitive and lacked tenacity of purpose\r\nessential to command in political life. He was a charming speaker--a\r\neulogist with the lightest touch and the most graceful style upon\r\ncertain themes of any speaker of his day. [Since these lines were\r\nwritten he has become, perhaps, the foremost eulogist of our race. He\r\nhas achieved a high place. All honor to him!]\r\n\r\nOne morning I called by appointment upon him. After greetings he took\r\nup an envelope which I saw as I entered had been carefully laid on his\r\ndesk, and handed it to me, saying:\r\n\r\n\"I wish you to dismiss your secretary.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a big order, Your Lordship. He is indispensable, and a\r\nScotsman,\" I replied. \"What is the matter with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"This isn't your handwriting; it is his. What do you think of a man\r\nwho spells Rosebery with two _r's_?\"\r\n\r\nI said if I were sensitive on that point life would not be endurable\r\nfor me. \"I receive many letters daily when at home and I am sure that\r\ntwenty to thirty per cent of them mis-spell my name, ranging from\r\n'Karnaghie' to 'Carnagay.'\"\r\n\r\nBut he was in earnest. Just such little matters gave him great\r\nannoyance. Men of action should learn to laugh at and enjoy these\r\nsmall things, or they themselves may become \"small.\" A charming\r\npersonality withal, but shy, sensitive, capricious, and reserved,\r\nqualities which a few years in the Commons would probably have\r\nmodified.\r\n\r\nWhen he was, as a Liberal, surprising the House of Lords and creating\r\nsome stir, I ventured to let off a little of my own democracy upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Stand for Parliament boldly. Throw off your hereditary rank,\r\ndeclaring you scorn to accept a privilege which is not the right of\r\nevery citizen. Thus make yourself the real leader of the people, which\r\nyou never can be while a peer. You are young, brilliant, captivating,\r\nwith the gift of charming speech. No question of your being Prime\r\nMinister if you take the plunge.\"\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, although apparently interested, he said very quietly:\r\n\r\n\"But the House of Commons couldn't admit me as a peer.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I should hope. If I were in your place, and rejected, I\r\nwould stand again for the next vacancy and force the issue. Insist\r\nthat one having renounced his hereditary privileges becomes elevated\r\nto citizenship and is eligible for any position to which he is\r\nelected. Victory is certain. That's playing the part of a Cromwell.\r\nDemocracy worships a precedent-breaker or a precedent-maker.\"\r\n\r\nWe dropped the subject. Telling Morley of this afterward, I shall\r\nnever forget his comment:\r\n\r\n\"My friend, Cromwell doesn't reside at Number 38 Berkeley Square.\"\r\nSlowly, solemnly spoken, but conclusive.\r\n\r\nFine fellow, Rosebery, only he was handicapped by being born a peer.\r\nOn the other hand, Morley, rising from the ranks, his father a surgeon\r\nhard-pressed to keep his son at college, is still \"Honest John,\"\r\nunaffected in the slightest degree by the so-called elevation to the\r\npeerage and the Legion of Honor, both given for merit. The same with\r\n\"Bob\" Reid, M.P., who became Earl Loreburn and Lord High Chancellor,\r\nLord Haldane, his successor as Chancellor; Asquith, Prime Minister,\r\nLloyd George, and others. Not even the rulers of our Republic to-day\r\nare more democratic or more thorough men of the people.\r\n\r\nWhen the world's foremost citizen passed away, the question was, Who\r\nis to succeed Gladstone; who can succeed him? The younger members of\r\nthe Cabinet agreed to leave the decision to Morley. Harcourt or\r\nCampbell-Bannerman? There was only one impediment in the path of the\r\nformer, but that was fatal--inability to control his temper. The issue\r\nhad unfortunately aroused him to such outbursts as really unfitted him\r\nfor leadership, and so the man of calm, sober, unclouded judgment was\r\nconsidered indispensable.\r\n\r\nI was warmly attached to Harcourt, who in turn was a devoted admirer\r\nof our Republic, as became the husband of Motley's daughter. Our\r\ncensus and our printed reports, which I took care that he should\r\nreceive, interested him deeply. Of course, the elevation\r\nof the representative of my native town of Dunfermline\r\n(Campbell-Bannerman)[64] gave me unalloyed pleasure, the more so since\r\nin returning thanks from the Town House to the people assembled he\r\nused these words:\r\n\r\n\"I owe my election to my Chairman, Bailie Morrison.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: Campbell-Bannerman was chosen leader of the Liberal\r\nParty in December, 1898.]\r\n\r\nThe Bailie, Dunfermline's leading radical, was my uncle. We were\r\nradical families in those days and are so still, both Carnegies and\r\nMorrisons, and intense admirers of the Great Republic, like that one\r\nwho extolled Washington and his colleagues as \"men who knew and dared\r\nproclaim the royalty of man\"--a proclamation worth while. There is\r\nnothing more certain than that the English-speaking race in orderly,\r\nlawful development will soon establish the golden rule of citizenship\r\nthrough evolution, never revolution:\r\n\r\n    \"The rank is but the guinea's stamp,\r\n    The man's the gowd for a' that.\"\r\n\r\nThis feeling already prevails in all the British colonies. The dear\r\nold Motherland hen has ducks for chickens which give her much anxiety\r\nbreasting the waves, while she, alarmed, screams wildly from the\r\nshore; but she will learn to swim also by and by.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1905 Mrs. Carnegie and I attended the ceremony of\r\ngiving the Freedom of Dunfermline to our friend, Dr. John Ross,\r\nchairman of the Carnegie Dunfermline Trust, foremost and most zealous\r\nworker for the good of the town. Provost Macbeth in his speech\r\ninformed the audience that the honor was seldom conferred, that there\r\nwere only three living burgesses--one their member of Parliament, H.\r\nCampbell-Bannerman, then Prime Minister; the Earl of Elgin of\r\nDunfermline, ex-Viceroy of India, then Colonial Secretary; and the\r\nthird myself. This seemed great company for me, so entirely out of the\r\nrunning was I as regards official station.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Elgin is the descendant of The Bruce. Their family vault\r\nis in Dunfermline Abbey, where his great ancestor lies under the Abbey\r\nbell. It has been noted how Secretary Stanton selected General Grant\r\nas the one man in the party who could not possibly be the commander.\r\nOne would be very apt to make a similar mistake about the Earl. When\r\nthe Scottish Universities were to be reformed the Earl was second on\r\nthe committee. When the Conservative Government formed its Committee\r\nupon the Boer War, the Earl, a Liberal, was appointed chairman. When\r\nthe decision of the House of Lords brought dire confusion upon the\r\nUnited Free Church of Scotland, Lord Elgin was called upon as the\r\nChairman of Committee to settle the matter. Parliament embodied his\r\nreport in a bill, and again he was placed at the head to apply it.\r\nWhen trustees for the Universities of Scotland Fund were to be\r\nselected, I told Prime Minister Balfour I thought the Earl of Elgin as\r\na Dunfermline magnate could be induced to take the chairmanship. He\r\nsaid I could not get a better man in Great Britain. So it has proved.\r\nJohn Morley said to me one day afterwards, but before he had, as a\r\nmember of the Dunfermline Trust, experience of the chairman:\r\n\r\n\"I used to think Elgin about the most problematical public man in high\r\nposition I had ever met, but I now know him one of the ablest. Deeds,\r\nnot words; judgment, not talk.\"\r\n\r\nSuch the descendant of The Bruce to-day, the embodiment of modest\r\nworth and wisdom combined.\r\n\r\nOnce started upon a Freedom-getting career, there seemed no end to\r\nthese honors.[65] With headquarters in London in 1906, I received six\r\nFreedoms in six consecutive days, and two the week following, going\r\nout by morning train and returning in the evening. It might be thought\r\nthat the ceremony would become monotonous, but this was not so, the\r\nconditions being different in each case. I met remarkable men in the\r\nmayors and provosts and the leading citizens connected with municipal\r\naffairs, and each community had its own individual stamp and its\r\nproblems, successes, and failures. There was generally one greatly\r\ndesired improvement overshadowing all other questions engrossing the\r\nattention of the people. Each was a little world in itself. The City\r\nCouncil is a Cabinet in miniature and the Mayor the Prime Minister.\r\nDomestic politics keep the people agog. Foreign relations are not\r\nwanting. There are inter-city questions with neighboring communities,\r\njoint water or gas or electrical undertakings of mighty import,\r\nconferences deciding for or against alliances or separations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: Mr. Carnegie had received no less than fifty-four\r\nFreedoms of cities in Great Britain and Ireland. This was a\r\nrecord--Mr. Gladstone coming second with seventeen.]\r\n\r\nIn no department is the contrast greater between the old world and the\r\nnew than in municipal government. In the former the families reside\r\nfor generations in the place of birth with increasing devotion to the\r\ntown and all its surroundings. A father achieving the mayorship\r\nstimulates the son to aspire to it. That invaluable asset, city pride,\r\nis created, culminating in romantic attachment to native places.\r\nCouncilorships are sought that each in his day and generation may be\r\nof some service to the town. To the best citizens this is a creditable\r\nobject of ambition. Few, indeed, look beyond it--membership in\r\nParliament being practically reserved for men of fortune, involving as\r\nit does residence in London without compensation. This latter,\r\nhowever, is soon to be changed and Britain follow the universal\r\npractice of paying legislators for service rendered. [In 1908; since\r\nrealized; four hundred pounds is now paid.]\r\n\r\nAfter this she will probably follow the rest of the world by having\r\nParliament meet in the daytime, its members fresh and ready for the\r\nday's work, instead of giving all day to professional work and then\r\nwith exhausted brains undertaking the work of governing the country\r\nafter dinner. Cavendish, the authority on whist, being asked if a man\r\ncould possibly finesse a knave, second round, third player, replied,\r\nafter reflecting, \"Yes, he might _after dinner_.\"\r\n\r\nThe best people are on the councils of British towns, incorruptible,\r\npublic-spirited men, proud of and devoted to their homes. In the\r\nUnited States progress is being made in this direction, but we are\r\nhere still far behind Britain. Nevertheless, people tend to settle\r\npermanently in places as the country becomes thickly populated. We\r\nshall develop the local patriot who is anxious to leave the place of\r\nhis birth a little better than he found it. It is only one generation\r\nsince the provostship of Scotch towns was generally reserved for one\r\nof the local landlords belonging to the upper classes. That \"the\r\nBriton dearly loves a lord\" is still true, but the love is rapidly\r\ndisappearing.\r\n\r\nIn Eastbourne, Kings-Lynn, Salisbury, Ilkeston, and many other ancient\r\ntowns, I found the mayor had risen from the ranks, and had generally\r\nworked with his hands. The majority of the council were also of this\r\ntype. All gave their time gratuitously. It was a source of much\r\npleasure to me to know the provosts and leaders in council of so many\r\ntowns in Scotland and England, not forgetting Ireland where my Freedom\r\ntour was equally attractive. Nothing could excel the reception\r\naccorded me in Cork, Waterford, and Limerick. It was surprising to see\r\nthe welcome on flags expressed in the same Gaelic words, _Cead mille\r\nfailthe_ (meaning \"a hundred thousand welcomes\") as used by the\r\ntenants of Skibo.\r\n\r\nNothing could have given me such insight into local public life and\r\npatriotism in Britain as Freedom-taking, which otherwise might have\r\nbecome irksome. I felt myself so much at home among the city chiefs\r\nthat the embarrassment of flags and crowds and people at the windows\r\nalong our route was easily met as part of the duty of the day, and\r\neven the address of the chief magistrate usually furnished new phases\r\nof life upon which I could dwell. The lady mayoresses were delightful\r\nin all their pride and glory.\r\n\r\nMy conclusion is that the United Kingdom is better served by the\r\nleading citizens of her municipalities, elected by popular vote, than\r\nany other country far and away can possibly be; and that all is sound\r\nto the core in that important branch of government. Parliament itself\r\ncould readily be constituted of a delegation of members from the town\r\ncouncils without impairing its efficiency. Perhaps when the sufficient\r\npayment of members is established, many of these will be found at\r\nWestminster and that to the advantage of the Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nGLADSTONE AND MORLEY\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone paid my \"American Four-in-Hand in Britain\" quite a\r\ncompliment when Mrs. Carnegie and I were his guests at Hawarden in\r\nApril, 1892. He suggested one day that I should spend the morning with\r\nhim in his new library, while he arranged his books (which no one\r\nexcept himself was ever allowed to touch), and we could converse. In\r\nprowling about the shelves I found a unique volume and called out to\r\nmy host, then on top of a library ladder far from me handling heavy\r\nvolumes:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gladstone, I find here a book 'Dunfermline Worthies,' by a friend\r\nof my father's. I knew some of the worthies when a child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he replied, \"and if you will pass your hand three or four books\r\nto the left I think you will find another book by a Dunfermline man.\"\r\n\r\nI did so and saw my book \"An American Four-in-Hand in Britain.\" Ere I\r\nhad done so, however, I heard that organ voice orating in full swing\r\nfrom the top of the ladder:\r\n\r\n\"What Mecca is to the Mohammedan, Benares to the Hindoo, Jerusalem to\r\nthe Christian, all that Dunfermline is to me.\"\r\n\r\nMy ears heard the voice some moments before my brain realized that\r\nthese were my own words called forth by the first glimpse caught of\r\nDunfermline as we approached it from the south.[66]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: The whole paragraph is as follows: \"How beautiful is\r\nDunfermline seen from the Ferry Hills, its grand old Abbey towering\r\nover all, seeming to hallow the city, and to lend a charm and dignity\r\nto the lowliest tenement! Nor is there in all broad Scotland, nor in\r\nmany places elsewhere that I know of, a more varied and delightful\r\nview than that obtained from the Park upon a fine day. What Benares is\r\nto the Hindoo, Mecca to the Mohammedan, Jerusalem to the Christian,\r\nall that Dunfermline is to me.\" (_An American Four-in-Hand in\r\nBritain_, p. 282.)]\r\n\r\n\"How on earth did you come to get this book?\" I asked. \"I had not the\r\nhonor of knowing you when it was written and could not have sent you a\r\ncopy.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" he replied, \"I had not then the pleasure of your acquaintance,\r\nbut some one, I think Rosebery, told me of the book and I sent for it\r\nand read it with delight. That tribute to Dunfermline struck me as so\r\nextraordinary it lingered with me. I could never forget it.\"\r\n\r\nThis incident occurred eight years after the \"American Four-in-Hand\"\r\nwas written, and adds another to the many proofs of Mr. Gladstone's\r\nwonderful memory. Perhaps as a vain author I may be pardoned for\r\nconfessing my grateful appreciation of his no less wonderful judgment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photograph from Underwood & Underwood, N.Y._\r\n\r\nWILLIAM E. GLADSTONE]\r\n\r\nThe politician who figures publicly as \"reader of the lesson\" on\r\nSundays, is apt to be regarded suspiciously. I confess that until I\r\nhad known Mr. Gladstone well, I had found the thought arising now and\r\nthen that the wary old gentleman might feel at least that these\r\nappearances cost him no votes. But all this vanished as I learned his\r\ntrue character. He was devout and sincere if ever man was. Yes, even\r\nwhen he records in his diary (referred to by Morley in his \"Life of\r\nGladstone\") that, while addressing the House of Commons on the budget\r\nfor several hours with great acceptance, he was \"conscious of being\r\nsustained by the Divine Power above.\" Try as one may, who can deny\r\nthat to one of such abounding faith this belief in the support of the\r\nUnknown Power must really have proved a sustaining influence,\r\nalthough it may shock others to think that any mortal being could be\r\nso bold as to imagine that the Creator of the Universe would concern\r\nhimself about Mr. Gladstone's budget, prepared for a little speck of\r\nthis little speck of earth? It seems almost sacrilegious, yet to Mr.\r\nGladstone we know it was the reverse--a religious belief such as has\r\nno doubt often enabled men to accomplish wonders as direct agents of\r\nGod and doing His work.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the Queen's Jubilee in June, 1887, Mr. Blaine and I\r\nwere to dine at Lord Wolverton's in Piccadilly, to meet Mr. and Mrs.\r\nGladstone--Mr. Blaine's first introduction to him. We started in a cab\r\nfrom the Metropole Hotel in good time, but the crowds were so dense\r\nthat the cab had to be abandoned in the middle of St. James's Street.\r\nReaching the pavement, Mr. Blaine following, I found a policeman and\r\nexplained to him who my companion was, where we were going, and asked\r\nhim if he could not undertake to get us there. He did so, pushing his\r\nway through the masses with all the authority of his office and we\r\nfollowed. But it was nine o'clock before we reached Lord Wolverton's.\r\nWe separated after eleven.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone explained that he and Mrs. Gladstone had been able to\r\nreach the house by coming through Hyde Park and around the back way.\r\nThey expected to get back to their residence, then in Carlton Terrace,\r\nin the same way. Mr. Blaine and I thought we should enjoy the streets\r\nand take our chances of getting back to the hotel by pushing through\r\nthe crowds. We were doing this successfully and were moving slowly\r\nwith the current past the Reform Club when I heard a word or two\r\nspoken by a voice close to the building on my right. I said to Mr.\r\nBlaine:\r\n\r\n\"That is Mr. Gladstone's voice.\"\r\n\r\nHe said: \"It is impossible. We have just left him returning to his\r\nresidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care; I recognize voices better than faces, and I am sure\r\nthat is Gladstone's.\"\r\n\r\nFinally I prevailed upon him to return a few steps. We got close to\r\nthe side of the house and moved back. I came to a muffled figure and\r\nwhispered:\r\n\r\n\"What does 'Gravity' out of its bed at midnight?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone was discovered. I told him I recognized his voice\r\nwhispering to his companion.\r\n\r\n\"And so,\" I said, \"the real ruler comes out to see the illuminations\r\nprepared for the nominal ruler!\"\r\n\r\nHe replied: \"Young man, I think it is time you were in bed.\"\r\n\r\nWe remained a few minutes with him, he being careful not to remove\r\nfrom his head and face the cloak that covered them. It was then past\r\nmidnight and he was eighty, but, boylike, after he got Mrs. Gladstone\r\nsafely home he had determined to see the show.\r\n\r\nThe conversation at the dinner between Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Blaine\r\nturned upon the differences in Parliamentary procedure between Britain\r\nand America. During the evening Mr. Gladstone cross-examined Mr.\r\nBlaine very thoroughly upon the mode of procedure of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of which Mr. Blaine had been the Speaker. I saw the\r\n\"previous question,\" and summary rules with us for restricting\r\nneedless debate made a deep impression upon Mr. Gladstone. At\r\nintervals the conversation took a wider range.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone was interested in more subjects than perhaps any other\r\nman in Britain. When I was last with him in Scotland, at Mr.\r\nArmistead's, his mind was as clear and vigorous as ever, his interest\r\nin affairs equally strong. The topic which then interested him most,\r\nand about which he plied me with questions, was the tall steel\r\nbuildings in our country, of which he had been reading. What puzzled\r\nhim was how it could be that the masonry of a fifth floor or sixth\r\nstory was often finished before the third or fourth. This I explained,\r\nmuch to his satisfaction. In getting to the bottom of things he was\r\nindefatigable.\r\n\r\nMr. Morley (although a lord he still remains as an author plain John\r\nMorley) became one of our British friends quite early as editor of the\r\n\"Fortnightly Review,\" which published my first contribution to a\r\nBritish periodical.[67] The friendship has widened and deepened in our\r\nold age until we mutually confess we are very close friends to each\r\nother.[68] We usually exchange short notes (sometimes long ones) on\r\nSunday afternoons as the spirit moves us. We are not alike; far from\r\nit. We are drawn together because opposites are mutually beneficial to\r\neach other. I am optimistic; all my ducks being swans. He is\r\npessimistic, looking out soberly, even darkly, upon the real dangers\r\nahead, and sometimes imagining vain things. He is inclined to see\r\n\"an officer in every bush.\" The world seems bright to me, and earth\r\nis often a real heaven--so happy I am and so thankful to the kind\r\nfates. Morley is seldom if ever wild about anything; his judgment is\r\nalways deliberate and his eyes are ever seeing the spots on the sun.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: _An American Four-in-Hand in Britain._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: \"Mr. Carnegie had proved his originality, fullness of\r\nmind, and bold strength of character, as much or more in the\r\ndistribution of wealth as he had shown skill and foresight in its\r\nacquisition. We had become known to one another more than twenty years\r\nbefore through Matthew Arnold. His extraordinary freshness of spirit\r\neasily carried Arnold, Herbert Spencer, myself, and afterwards many\r\nothers, high over an occasional crudity or haste in judgment such as\r\nbefalls the best of us in ardent hours. People with a genius for\r\npicking up pins made as much as they liked of this: it was wiser to do\r\njustice to his spacious feel for the great objects of the world--for\r\nknowledge and its spread, invention, light, improvement of social\r\nrelations, equal chances to the talents, the passion for peace. These\r\nare glorious things; a touch of exaggeration in expression is easy to\r\nset right.... A man of high and wide and well-earned mark in his\r\ngeneration.\" (John, Viscount Morley, in _Recollections_, vol. II, pp.\r\n110, 112. New York, 1919.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photograph from Underwood & Underwood, N.Y._\r\n\r\nVISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN]\r\n\r\nI told him the story of the pessimist whom nothing ever pleased, and\r\nthe optimist whom nothing ever displeased, being congratulated by the\r\nangels upon their having obtained entrance to heaven. The pessimist\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, very good place, but somehow or other this halo don't fit my\r\nhead exactly.\"\r\n\r\nThe optimist retorted by telling the story of a man being carried down\r\nto purgatory and the Devil laying his victim up against a bank while\r\nhe got a drink at a spring--temperature very high. An old friend\r\naccosted him:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Jim, how's this? No remedy possible; you're a gone coon sure.\"\r\n\r\nThe reply came: \"Hush, it might be worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's that, when you are being carried down to the bottomless pit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush\"--pointing to his Satanic Majesty--\"he might take a notion to\r\nmake me carry him.\"\r\n\r\nMorley, like myself, was very fond of music and reveled in the morning\r\nhour during which the organ was being played at Skibo. He was\r\nattracted by the oratorios as also Arthur Balfour. I remember they got\r\ntickets together for an oratorio at the Crystal Palace. Both are sane\r\nbut philosophic, and not very far apart as philosophers, I understand;\r\nbut some recent productions of Balfour send him far afield\r\nspeculatively--a field which Morley never attempts. He keeps his foot\r\non the firm ground and only treads where the way is cleared. No\r\ndanger of his being \"lost in the woods\" while searching for the path.\r\n\r\nMorley's most astonishing announcement of recent days was in his\r\naddress to the editors of the world, assembled in London. He informed\r\nthem in effect that a few lines from Burns had done more to form and\r\nmaintain the present improved political and social conditions of the\r\npeople than all the millions of editorials ever written. This followed\r\na remark that there were now and then a few written or spoken words\r\nwhich were in themselves events; they accomplished what they\r\ndescribed. Tom Paine's \"Rights of Man\" was mentioned as such.\r\n\r\nUpon his arrival at Skibo after this address we talked it over. I\r\nreferred to his tribute to Burns and his six lines, and he replied\r\nthat he didn't need to tell me what lines these were.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said, \"I know them by heart.\"\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent address, unveiling a statue of Burns in the park at\r\nMontrose, I repeated the lines I supposed he referred to, and he\r\napproved them. He and I, strange to say, had received the Freedom of\r\nMontrose together years before, so we are fellow-freemen.\r\n\r\nAt last I induced Morley to visit us in America, and he made a tour\r\nthrough a great part of our country in 1904. We tried to have him meet\r\ndistinguished men like himself. One day Senator Elihu Root called at\r\nmy request and Morley had a long interview with him. After the Senator\r\nleft Morley remarked to me that he had enjoyed his companion greatly,\r\nas being the most satisfactory American statesman he had yet met. He\r\nwas not mistaken. For sound judgment and wide knowledge of our public\r\naffairs Elihu Root has no superior.\r\n\r\nMorley left us to pay a visit to President Roosevelt at the White\r\nHouse, and spent several fruitful days in company with that\r\nextraordinary man. Later, Morley's remark was:\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've seen two wonders in America, Roosevelt and Niagara.\"\r\n\r\nThat was clever and true to life--a great pair of roaring, tumbling,\r\ndashing and splashing wonders, knowing no rest, but both doing their\r\nappointed work, such as it is.\r\n\r\nMorley was the best person to have the Acton library and my gift of it\r\nto him came about in this way. When Mr. Gladstone told me the position\r\nLord Acton was in, I agreed, at his suggestion, to buy Acton's library\r\nand allow it to remain for his use during life. Unfortunately, he did\r\nnot live long to enjoy it--only a few years--and then I had the\r\nlibrary upon my hands. I decided that Morley could make the best use\r\nof it for himself and would certainly leave it eventually to the\r\nproper institution. I began to tell him that I owned it when he\r\ninterrupted me, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Well, I must tell you I have known this from the day you bought it.\r\nMr. Gladstone couldn't keep the secret, being so overjoyed that Lord\r\nActon had it secure for life.\"\r\n\r\nHere were he and I in close intimacy, and yet never had one mentioned\r\nthe situation to the other; but it was a surprise to me that Morley\r\nwas not surprised. This incident proved the closeness of the bond\r\nbetween Gladstone and Morley--the only man he could not resist sharing\r\nhis happiness with regarding earthly affairs. Yet on theological\r\nsubjects they were far apart where Acton and Gladstone were akin.\r\n\r\nThe year after I gave the fund for the Scottish universities Morley\r\nwent to Balmoral as minister in attendance upon His Majesty, and wired\r\nthat he must see me before we sailed. We met and he informed me His\r\nMajesty was deeply impressed with the gift to the universities and the\r\nothers I had made to my native land, and wished him to ascertain\r\nwhether there was anything in his power to bestow which I would\r\nappreciate.\r\n\r\nI asked: \"What did you say?\"\r\n\r\nMorley replied: \"I do not think so.\"\r\n\r\nI said: \"You are quite right, except that if His Majesty would write\r\nme a note expressing his satisfaction with what I had done, as he has\r\nto you, this would be deeply appreciated and handed down to my\r\ndescendants as something they would all be proud of.\"\r\n\r\nThis was done. The King's autograph note I have already transcribed\r\nelsewhere in these pages.\r\n\r\nThat Skibo has proved the best of all health resorts for Morley is\r\nindeed fortunate, for he comes to us several times each summer and is\r\none of the family, Lady Morley accompanying him. He is as fond of the\r\nyacht as I am myself, and, fortunately again, it is the best medicine\r\nfor both of us. Morley is, and must always remain, \"Honest John.\" No\r\nprevarication with him, no nonsense, firm as a rock upon all questions\r\nand in all emergencies; yet always looking around, fore and aft, right\r\nand left, with a big heart not often revealed in all its tenderness,\r\nbut at rare intervals and upon fit occasion leaving no doubt of its\r\npresence and power. And after that silence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. CARNEGIE WITH VISCOUNT MORLEY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CARNEGIE FAMILY AT SKIBO]\r\n\r\nChamberlain and Morley were fast friends as advanced radicals, and I\r\noften met and conferred with them when in Britain. When the Home Rule\r\nissue was raised, much interest was aroused in Britain over our\r\nAmerican Federal system. I was appealed to freely and delivered\r\npublic addresses in several cities, explaining and extolling our\r\nunion, many in one, the freest government of the parts producing the\r\nstrongest government of the whole. I sent Mr. Chamberlain Miss Anna L.\r\nDawes's \"How We Are Governed,\" at his request for information, and had\r\nconversations with Morley, Gladstone, and many others upon the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nI had to write Mr. Morley that I did not approve of the first Home\r\nRule Bill for reasons which I gave. When I met Mr. Gladstone he\r\nexpressed his regret at this and a full talk ensued. I objected to the\r\nexclusion of the Irish members from Parliament as being a practical\r\nseparation. I said we should never have allowed the Southern States to\r\ncease sending representatives to Washington.\r\n\r\n\"What would you have done if they refused?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Employed all the resources of civilization--first, stopped the\r\nmails,\" I replied.\r\n\r\nHe paused and repeated:\r\n\r\n\"Stop the mails.\" He felt the paralysis this involved and was silent,\r\nand changed the subject.\r\n\r\nIn answer to questions as to what I should do, I always pointed out\r\nthat America had many legislatures, but only one Congress. Britain\r\nshould follow her example, one Parliament and local legislatures (not\r\nparliaments) for Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. These should be made\r\nstates like New York and Virginia. But as Britain has no Supreme\r\nCourt, as we have, to decide upon laws passed, not only by state\r\nlegislatures but by Congress, the judicial being the final authority\r\nand not the political, Britain should have Parliament as the one\r\nnational final authority over Irish measures. Therefore, the acts of\r\nthe local legislature of Ireland should lie for three months'\r\ncontinuous session upon the table of the House of Commons, subject to\r\nadverse action of the House, but becoming operative unless\r\ndisapproved. The provision would be a dead letter unless improper\r\nlegislation were enacted, but if there were improper legislation, then\r\nit would be salutary. The clause, I said, was needed to assure timid\r\npeople that no secession could arise.\r\n\r\nUrging this view upon Mr. Morley afterwards, he told me this had been\r\nproposed to Parnell, but rejected. Mr. Gladstone might then have said:\r\n\"Very well, this provision is not needed for myself and others who\r\nthink with me, but it is needed to enable us to carry Britain with us.\r\nI am now unable to take up the question. The responsibility is yours.\"\r\n\r\nOne morning at Hawarden Mrs. Gladstone said:\r\n\r\n\"William tells me he has such extraordinary conversations with you.\"\r\n\r\nThese he had, no doubt. He had not often, if ever, heard the breezy\r\ntalk of a genuine republican and did not understand my inability to\r\nconceive of different hereditary ranks. It seemed strange to me that\r\nmen should deliberately abandon the name given them by their parents,\r\nand that name the parents' name. Especially amusing were the new\r\ntitles which required the old hereditary nobles much effort to refrain\r\nfrom smiling at as they greeted the newly made peer who had perhaps\r\nbought his title for ten thousand pounds, more or less, given to the\r\nparty fund.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine was with us in London and I told Mr. Gladstone he had\r\nexpressed to me his wonder and pain at seeing him in his old age hat\r\nin hand, cold day as it was, at a garden party doing homage to titled\r\nnobodies. Union of Church and State was touched upon, and also my\r\n\"Look Ahead,\" which foretells the reunion of our race owing to the\r\ninability of the British Islands to expand. I had held that the\r\ndisestablishment of the English Church was inevitable, because among\r\nother reasons it was an anomaly. No other part of the race had it. All\r\nreligions were fostered, none favored, in every other English-speaking\r\nstate. Mr. Gladstone asked:\r\n\r\n\"How long do you give our Established Church to live?\"\r\n\r\nMy reply was I could not fix a date; he had had more experience than I\r\nin disestablishing churches. He nodded and smiled.\r\n\r\nWhen I had enlarged upon a certain relative decrease of population in\r\nBritain that must come as compared with other countries of larger\r\narea, he asked:\r\n\r\n\"What future do you forecast for her?\"\r\n\r\nI referred to Greece among ancient nations and said that it was,\r\nperhaps, not accident that Chaucer, Shakespeare, Spenser, Milton,\r\nBurns, Scott, Stevenson, Bacon, Cromwell, Wallace, Bruce, Hume, Watt,\r\nSpencer, Darwin, and other celebrities had arisen here. Genius did not\r\ndepend upon material resources. Long after Britain could not figure\r\nprominently as an industrial nation, not by her decline, but through\r\nthe greater growth of others, she might in my opinion become the\r\nmodern Greece and achieve among nations moral ascendancy.\r\n\r\nHe caught at the words, repeating them musingly:\r\n\r\n\"Moral ascendancy, moral ascendancy, I like that, I like that.\"\r\n\r\nI had never before so thoroughly enjoyed a conference with a man. I\r\nvisited him again at Hawarden, but my last visit to him was at Lord\r\nRandall's at Cannes the winter of 1897 when he was suffering keenly.\r\nHe had still the old charm and was especially attentive to my\r\nsister-in-law, Lucy, who saw him then for the first time and was\r\ndeeply impressed. As we drove off, she murmured, \"A sick eagle! A sick\r\neagle!\" Nothing could better describe this wan and worn leader of men\r\nas he appeared to me that day. He was not only a great, but a truly\r\ngood man, stirred by the purest impulses, a high, imperious soul\r\nalways looking upward. He had, indeed, earned the title: \"Foremost\r\nCitizen of the World.\"\r\n\r\nIn Britain, in 1881, I had entered into business relations with Samuel\r\nStorey, M.P., a very able man, a stern radical, and a genuine\r\nrepublican. We purchased several British newspapers and began a\r\ncampaign of political progress upon radical lines. Passmore Edwards\r\nand some others joined us, but the result was not encouraging. Harmony\r\ndid not prevail among my British friends and finally I decided to\r\nwithdraw, which I was fortunately able to do without loss.[69]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: Mr. Carnegie acquired no less than eighteen British\r\nnewspapers with the idea of promoting radical views. The political\r\nresults were disappointing, but with his genius for making money the\r\npecuniary results were more than satisfactory.]\r\n\r\nMy third literary venture, \"Triumphant Democracy,\"[70] had its origin\r\nin realizing how little the best-informed foreigner, or even Briton,\r\nknew of America, and how distorted that little was. It was prodigious\r\nwhat these eminent Englishmen did not then know about the Republic. My\r\nfirst talk with Mr. Gladstone in 1882 can never be forgotten. When I\r\nhad occasion to say that the majority of the English-speaking race was\r\nnow republican and it was a minority of monarchists who were upon the\r\ndefensive, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Why, how is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Gladstone,\" I said, \"the Republic holds sway over a larger\r\nnumber of English-speaking people than the population of Great Britain\r\nand all her colonies even if the English-speaking colonies were\r\nnumbered twice over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! how is that? What is your population?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sixty-six millions, and yours is not much more than half.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes, surprising!\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: _Triumphant Democracy, or Fifty Years' March of the\r\nRepublic._ London, 1886; New York, 1888.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the wealth of the nations, it was equally surprising\r\nfor him to learn that the census of 1880 proved the hundred-year-old\r\nRepublic could purchase Great Britain and Ireland and all their\r\nrealized capital and investments and then pay off Britain's debt, and\r\nyet not exhaust her fortune. But the most startling statement of all\r\nwas that which I was able to make when the question of Free Trade was\r\ntouched upon. I pointed out that America was now the greatest\r\nmanufacturing nation in the world. [At a later date I remember Lord\r\nChancellor Haldane fell into the same error, calling Britain the\r\ngreatest manufacturing country in the world, and thanked me for\r\nputting him right.] I quoted Mulhall's figures: British manufactures\r\nin 1880, eight hundred and sixteen millions sterling; American\r\nmanufactures eleven hundred and twenty-six millions sterling.[71] His\r\none word was:\r\n\r\n\"Incredible!\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: The estimated value of manufactures in Great Britain in\r\n1900 was five billions of dollars as compared to thirteen billions for\r\nthe United States. In 1914 the United States had gone to over\r\ntwenty-four billions.]\r\n\r\nOther startling statements followed and he asked:\r\n\r\n\"Why does not some writer take up this subject and present the facts\r\nin a simple and direct form to the world?\"\r\n\r\nI was then, as a matter of fact, gathering material for \"Triumphant\r\nDemocracy,\" in which I intended to perform the very service which he\r\nindicated, as I informed him.\r\n\r\n\"Round the World\" and the \"American Four-in-Hand\" gave me not the\r\nslightest effort but the preparation of \"Triumphant Democracy,\" which\r\nI began in 1882, was altogether another matter. It required steady,\r\nlaborious work. Figures had to be examined and arranged, but as I went\r\nforward the study became fascinating. For some months I seemed to have\r\nmy head filled with statistics. The hours passed away unheeded. It was\r\nevening when I supposed it was midday. The second serious illness of\r\nmy life dates from the strain brought upon me by this work, for I had\r\nto attend to business as well. I shall think twice before I trust\r\nmyself again with anything so fascinating as figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nHERBERT SPENCER AND HIS DISCIPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nHerbert Spencer, with his friend Mr. Lott and myself, were fellow\r\ntravelers on the Servia from Liverpool to New York in 1882. I bore a\r\nnote of introduction to him from Mr. Morley, but I had met the\r\nphilosopher in London before that. I was one of his disciples. As an\r\nolder traveler, I took Mr. Lott and him in charge. We sat at the same\r\ntable during the voyage.\r\n\r\nOne day the conversation fell upon the impression made upon us by\r\ngreat men at first meeting. Did they, or did they not, prove to be as\r\nwe had imagined them? Each gave his experience. Mine was that nothing\r\ncould be more different than the being imagined and that being beheld\r\nin the flesh.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Mr. Spencer, \"in my case, for instance, was this so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"you more than any. I had imagined my teacher, the\r\ngreat calm philosopher brooding, Buddha-like, over all things,\r\nunmoved; never did I dream of seeing him excited over the question of\r\nCheshire or Cheddar cheese.\" The day before he had peevishly pushed\r\naway the former when presented by the steward, exclaiming \"Cheddar,\r\nCheddar, not Cheshire; I said _Cheddar_.\" There was a roar in which\r\nnone joined more heartily than the sage himself. He refers to this\r\nincident of the voyage in his Autobiography.[72]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: _An Autobiography_, by Herbert Spencer, vol. I, p. 424.\r\nNew York, 1904.]\r\n\r\nSpencer liked stories and was a good laugher. American stories seemed\r\nto please him more than others, and of those I was able to tell him\r\nnot a few, which were usually followed by explosive laughter. He was\r\nanxious to learn about our Western Territories, which were then\r\nattracting attention in Europe, and a story I told him about Texas\r\nstruck him as amusing. When a returning disappointed emigrant from\r\nthat State was asked about the then barren country, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Stranger, all that I have to say about Texas is that if I owned Texas\r\nand h--l, I would sell Texas.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a change from those early days! Texas has now over four millions\r\nof population and is said to have the soil to produce more cotton than\r\nthe whole world did in 1882.\r\n\r\nThe walk up to the house, when I had the philosopher out at\r\nPittsburgh, reminded me of another American story of the visitor who\r\nstarted to come up the garden walk. When he opened the gate a big dog\r\nfrom the house rushed down upon him. He retreated and closed the\r\ngarden gate just in time, the host calling out:\r\n\r\n\"He won't touch you, you know barking dogs never bite.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" exclaimed the visitor, tremblingly, \"I know that and you know\r\nit, but does the dog know it?\"\r\n\r\nOne day my eldest nephew was seen to open the door quietly and peep in\r\nwhere we were seated. His mother afterwards asked him why he had done\r\nso and the boy of eleven replied:\r\n\r\n\"Mamma, I wanted to see the man who wrote in a book that there was no\r\nuse studying grammar.\"\r\n\r\nSpencer was greatly pleased when he heard the story and often referred\r\nto it. He had faith in that nephew.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HERBERT SPENCER AT SEVENTY-EIGHT]\r\n\r\nSpeaking to him one day about his having signed a remonstrance against\r\na tunnel between Calais and Dover as having surprised me, he explained\r\nthat for himself he was as anxious to have the tunnel as any one\r\nand that he did not believe in any of the objections raised against\r\nit, but signed the remonstrance because he knew his countrymen were\r\nsuch fools that the military and naval element in Britain could\r\nstampede the masses, frighten them, and stimulate militarism. An\r\nincreased army and navy would then be demanded. He referred to a scare\r\nwhich had once arisen and involved the outlay of many millions in\r\nfortifications which had proved useless.\r\n\r\nOne day we were sitting in our rooms in the Grand Hotel looking out\r\nover Trafalgar Square. The Life Guards passed and the following took\r\nplace:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Spencer, I never see men dressed up like Merry Andrews without\r\nbeing saddened and indignant that in the nineteenth century the most\r\ncivilized race, as we consider ourselves, still finds men willing to\r\nadopt as a profession--until lately the only profession for\r\ngentlemen--the study of the surest means of killing other men.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Spencer said: \"I feel just so myself, but I will tell you how I\r\ncurb my indignation. Whenever I feel it rising I am calmed by this\r\nstory of Emerson's: He had been hooted and hustled from the platform\r\nin Faneuil Hall for daring to speak against slavery. He describes\r\nhimself walking home in violent anger, until opening his garden gate\r\nand looking up through the branches of the tall elms that grew between\r\nthe gate and his modest home, he saw the stars shining through. They\r\nsaid to him: 'What, so hot, my little sir?'\" I laughed and he laughed,\r\nand I thanked him for that story. Not seldom I have to repeat to\r\nmyself, \"What, so hot, my little sir?\" and it suffices.\r\n\r\nMr. Spencer's visit to America had its climax in the banquet given\r\nfor him at Delmonico's. I drove him to it and saw the great man there\r\nin a funk. He could think of nothing but the address he was to\r\ndeliver.[73] I believe he had rarely before spoken in public. His\r\ngreat fear was that he should be unable to say anything that would be\r\nof advantage to the American people, who had been the first to\r\nappreciate his works. He may have attended many banquets, but never\r\none comprised of more distinguished people than this one. It was a\r\nremarkable gathering. The tributes paid Spencer by the ablest men were\r\nunique. The climax was reached when Henry Ward Beecher, concluding his\r\naddress, turned round and addressed Mr. Spencer in these words:\r\n\r\n\"To my father and my mother I owe my physical being; to you, sir, I\r\nowe my intellectual being. At a critical moment you provided the safe\r\npaths through the bogs and morasses; you were my teacher.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: \"An occasion, on which more, perhaps, than any other in\r\nmy life, I ought to have been in good condition, bodily and mentally,\r\ncame when I was in a condition worse than I had been for six and\r\ntwenty years. 'Wretched night; no sleep at all; kept in my room all\r\nday' says my diary, and I entertained 'great fear I should collapse.'\r\nWhen the hour came for making my appearance at Delmonico's, where the\r\ndinner was given, I got my friends to secrete me in an anteroom until\r\nthe last moment, so that I might avoid all excitements of\r\nintroductions and congratulations; and as Mr. Evarts, who presided,\r\nhanded me on the dais, I begged him to limit his conversation with me\r\nas much as possible, and to expect very meagre responses. The event\r\nproved that, trying though the tax was, there did not result the\r\ndisaster I feared; and when Mr. Evarts had duly uttered the\r\ncompliments of the occasion, I was able to get through my prepared\r\nspeech without difficulty, though not with much effect.\" (Spencer's\r\n_Autobiography_, vol. II, p. 478.)]\r\n\r\nThese words were spoken in slow, solemn tones. I do not remember ever\r\nhaving noticed more depth of feeling; evidently they came from a\r\ngrateful debtor. Mr. Spencer was touched by the words. They gave rise\r\nto considerable remark, and shortly afterwards Mr. Beecher preached a\r\ncourse of sermons, giving his views upon Evolution. The conclusion of\r\nthe series was anxiously looked for, because his acknowledgment of\r\ndebt to Spencer as his teacher had created alarm in church circles. In\r\nthe concluding article, as in his speech, if I remember rightly, Mr.\r\nBeecher said that, although he believed in evolution (Darwinism) up to\r\na certain point, yet when man had reached his highest human level his\r\nCreator then invested him (and man alone of all living things) with\r\nthe Holy Spirit, thereby bringing him into the circle of the godlike.\r\nThus he answered his critics.\r\n\r\nMr. Spencer took intense interest in mechanical devices. When he\r\nvisited our works with me the new appliances impressed him, and in\r\nafter years he sometimes referred to these and said his estimate of\r\nAmerican invention and push had been fully realized. He was naturally\r\npleased with the deference and attention paid him in America.\r\n\r\nI seldom if ever visited England without going to see him, even after\r\nhe had removed to Brighton that he might live looking out upon the\r\nsea, which appealed to and soothed him. I never met a man who seemed\r\nto weigh so carefully every action, every word--even the pettiest--and\r\nso completely to find guidance through his own conscience. He was no\r\nscoffer in religious matters. In the domain of theology, however, he\r\nhad little regard for decorum. It was to him a very faulty system\r\nhindering true growth, and the idea of rewards and punishments struck\r\nhim as an appeal to very low natures indeed. Still he never went to\r\nsuch lengths as Tennyson did upon an occasion when some of the old\r\nideas were under discussion. Knowles[74] told me that Tennyson lost\r\ncontrol of himself. Knowles said he was greatly disappointed with the\r\nson's life of the poet as giving no true picture of his father in his\r\nrevolt against stern theology.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: James Knowles, founder of _Nineteenth Century_.]\r\n\r\nSpencer was always the calm philosopher. I believe that from childhood\r\nto old age--when the race was run--he never was guilty of an immoral\r\nact or did an injustice to any human being. He was certainly one of\r\nthe most conscientious men in all his doings that ever was born. Few\r\nmen have wished to know another man more strongly than I to know\r\nHerbert Spencer, for seldom has one been more deeply indebted than I\r\nto him and to Darwin.\r\n\r\nReaction against the theology of past days comes to many who have been\r\nsurrounded in youth by church people entirely satisfied that the truth\r\nand faith indispensable to future happiness were derived only through\r\nstrictest Calvinistic creeds. The thoughtful youth is naturally\r\ncarried along and disposed to concur in this. He cannot but think, up\r\nto a certain period of development, that what is believed by the best\r\nand the highest educated around him--those to whom he looks for\r\nexample and instruction--must be true. He resists doubt as inspired by\r\nthe Evil One seeking his soul, and sure to get it unless faith comes\r\nto the rescue. Unfortunately he soon finds that faith is not exactly\r\nat his beck and call. Original sin he thinks must be at the root of\r\nthis inability to see as he wishes to see, to believe as he wishes to\r\nbelieve. It seems clear to him that already he is little better than\r\none of the lost. Of the elect he surely cannot be, for these must be\r\nministers, elders, and strictly orthodox men.\r\n\r\nThe young man is soon in chronic rebellion, trying to assume godliness\r\nwith the others, acquiescing outwardly in the creed and all its\r\nteachings, and yet at heart totally unable to reconcile his outward\r\naccordance with his inward doubt. If there be intellect and virtue in\r\nthe man but one result is possible; that is, Carlyle's position after\r\nhis terrible struggle when after weeks of torment he came forth: \"If\r\nit be incredible, in God's name, then, let it be discredited.\" With\r\nthat the load of doubt and fear fell from him forever.\r\n\r\nWhen I, along with three or four of my boon companions, was in this\r\nstage of doubt about theology, including the supernatural element, and\r\nindeed the whole scheme of salvation through vicarious atonement and\r\nall the fabric built upon it, I came fortunately upon Darwin's and\r\nSpencer's works \"The Data of Ethics,\" \"First Principles,\" \"Social\r\nStatics,\" \"The Descent of Man.\" Reaching the pages which explain how\r\nman has absorbed such mental foods as were favorable to him, retaining\r\nwhat was salutary, rejecting what was deleterious, I remember that\r\nlight came as in a flood and all was clear. Not only had I got rid of\r\ntheology and the supernatural, but I had found the truth of evolution.\r\n\"All is well since all grows better\" became my motto, my true source\r\nof comfort. Man was not created with an instinct for his own\r\ndegradation, but from the lower he had risen to the higher forms. Nor\r\nis there any conceivable end to his march to perfection. His face is\r\nturned to the light; he stands in the sun and looks upward.\r\n\r\nHumanity is an organism, inherently rejecting all that is deleterious,\r\nthat is, wrong, and absorbing after trial what is beneficial, that is,\r\nright. If so disposed, the Architect of the Universe, we must assume,\r\nmight have made the world and man perfect, free from evil and from\r\npain, as angels in heaven are thought to be; but although this was not\r\ndone, man has been given the power of advancement rather than of\r\nretrogression. The Old and New Testaments remain, like other sacred\r\nwritings of other lands, of value as records of the past and for such\r\ngood lessons as they inculcate. Like the ancient writers of the Bible\r\nour thoughts should rest upon this life and our duties here. \"To\r\nperform the duties of this world well, troubling not about another, is\r\nthe prime wisdom,\" says Confucius, great sage and teacher. The next\r\nworld and its duties we shall consider when we are placed in it.\r\n\r\nI am as a speck of dust in the sun, and not even so much, in this\r\nsolemn, mysterious, unknowable universe. I shrink back. One truth I\r\nsee. Franklin was right. \"The highest worship of God is service to\r\nMan.\" All this, however, does not prevent everlasting hope of\r\nimmortality. It would be no greater miracle to be born to a future\r\nlife than to have been born to live in this present life. The one has\r\nbeen created, why not the other? Therefore there is reason to hope for\r\nimmortality. Let us hope.[75]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: \"A.C. is really a tremendous personality--dramatic,\r\nwilful, generous, whimsical, at times almost cruel in pressing his own\r\nconviction upon others, and then again tender, affectionate,\r\nemotional, always imaginative, unusual and wide-visioned in his views.\r\nHe is well worth Boswellizing, but I am urging him to be 'his own\r\nBoswell.'... He is inconsistent in many ways, but with a passion for\r\nlofty views; the brotherhood of man, peace among nations, religious\r\npurity--I mean the purification of religion from gross\r\nsuperstition--the substitution for a Westminster-Catechism God, of a\r\nRighteous, a Just God.\" (_Letters of Richard Watson Gilder_, p. 375.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nBLAINE AND HARRISON\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile one is known by the company he keeps, it is equally true that\r\none is known by the stories he tells. Mr. Blaine was one of the best\r\nstory-tellers I ever met. His was a bright sunny nature with a witty,\r\npointed story for every occasion.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine's address at Yorktown (I had accompanied him there) was\r\ngreatly admired. It directed special attention to the cordial\r\nfriendship which had grown up between the two branches of the\r\nEnglish-speaking race, and ended with the hope that the prevailing\r\npeace and good-will between the two nations would exist for many\r\ncenturies to come. When he read this to me, I remember that the word\r\n\"many\" jarred, and I said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Secretary, might I suggest the change of one word? I don't like\r\n'many'; why not 'all' the centuries to come?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good, that is perfect!\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it was given in the address: \"for _all_ the centuries to come.\"\r\n\r\nWe had a beautiful night returning from Yorktown, and, sitting in the\r\nstern of the ship in the moonlight, the military band playing forward,\r\nwe spoke of the effect of music. Mr. Blaine said that his favorite\r\njust then was the \"Sweet By and By,\" which he had heard played last by\r\nthe same band at President Garfield's funeral, and he thought upon\r\nthat occasion he was more deeply moved by sweet sounds than he had\r\never been in his life. He requested that it should be the last piece\r\nplayed that night. Both he and Gladstone were fond of simple music.\r\nThey could enjoy Beethoven and the classic masters, but Wagner was as\r\nyet a sealed book to them.\r\n\r\nIn answer to my inquiry as to the most successful speech he ever heard\r\nin Congress, he replied it was that of the German, ex-Governor Ritter\r\nof Pennsylvania. The first bill appropriating money for inland _fresh_\r\nwaters was under consideration. The house was divided. Strict\r\nconstructionists held this to be unconstitutional; only harbors upon\r\nthe salt sea were under the Federal Government. The contest was keen\r\nand the result doubtful, when to the astonishment of the House,\r\nGovernor Ritter slowly arose for the first time. Silence at once\r\nreigned. What was the old German ex-Governor going to say--he who had\r\nnever said anything at all? Only this:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Speaker, I don't know much particulars about de constitution, but\r\nI know dis; I wouldn't gif a d----d cent for a constitution dat didn't\r\nwash in fresh water as well as in salt.\" The House burst into an\r\nuproar of uncontrollable laughter, and the bill passed.\r\n\r\nSo came about this new departure and one of the most beneficent ways\r\nof spending government money, and of employing army and navy\r\nengineers. Little of the money spent by the Government yields so great\r\na return. So expands our flexible constitution to meet the new wants\r\nof an expanding population. Let who will make the constitution if we\r\nof to-day are permitted to interpret it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photograph from Underwood & Underwood, N.Y._\r\n\r\nJAMES G. BLAINE]\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine's best story, if one can be selected from so many that were\r\nexcellent, I think was the following:\r\n\r\nIn the days of slavery and the underground railroads, there lived on\r\nthe banks of the Ohio River near Gallipolis, a noted Democrat named\r\nJudge French, who said to some anti-slavery friends that he should\r\nlike them to bring to his office the first runaway negro that crossed\r\nthe river, bound northward by the underground. He couldn't understand\r\nwhy they wished to run away. This was done, and the following\r\nconversation took place:\r\n\r\n_Judge:_ \"So you have run away from Kentucky. Bad master, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n_Slave:_ \"Oh, no, Judge; very good, kind massa.\"\r\n\r\n_Judge:_ \"He worked you too hard?\"\r\n\r\n_Slave:_ \"No, sah, never overworked myself all my life.\"\r\n\r\n_Judge, hesitatingly:_ \"He did not give you enough to eat?\"\r\n\r\n_Slave:_ \"Not enough to eat down in Kaintuck? Oh, Lor', plenty to\r\neat.\"\r\n\r\n_Judge:_ \"He did not clothe you well?\"\r\n\r\n_Slave:_ \"Good enough clothes for me, Judge.\"\r\n\r\n_Judge:_ \"You hadn't a comfortable home?\"\r\n\r\n_Slave:_ \"Oh, Lor', makes me cry to think of my pretty little cabin\r\ndown dar in old Kaintuck.\"\r\n\r\n_Judge, after a pause:_ \"You had a good, kind master, you were not\r\noverworked, plenty to eat, good clothes, fine home. I don't see why\r\nthe devil you wished to run away.\"\r\n\r\n_Slave:_ \"Well, Judge, I lef de situation down dar open. You kin go\r\nrite down and git it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Judge had seen a great light.\r\n\r\n    \"Freedom has a thousand charms to show,\r\n    That slaves, howe'er contented, never know.\"\r\n\r\nThat the colored people in such numbers risked all for liberty is the\r\nbest possible proof that they will steadily approach and finally reach\r\nthe full stature of citizenship in the Republic.\r\n\r\nI never saw Mr. Blaine so happy as while with us at Cluny. He was a\r\nboy again and we were a rollicking party together. He had never fished\r\nwith a fly. I took him out on Loch Laggan and he began awkwardly, as\r\nall do, but he soon caught the swing. I shall never forget his first\r\ncapture:\r\n\r\n\"My friend, you have taught me a new pleasure in life. There are a\r\nhundred fishing lochs in Maine, and I'll spend my holidays in future\r\nupon them trout-fishing.\"\r\n\r\nAt Cluny there is no night in June and we danced on the lawn in the\r\nbright twilight until late. Mrs. Blaine, Miss Dodge, Mr. Blaine, and\r\nother guests were trying to do the Scotch reel, and \"whooping\" like\r\nHighlanders. We were gay revelers during those two weeks. One night\r\nafterwards, at a dinner in our home in New York, chiefly made up of\r\nour Cluny visitors, Mr. Blaine told the company that he had discovered\r\nat Cluny what a real holiday was. \"It is when the merest trifles\r\nbecome the most serious events of life.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison's nomination for the presidency in 1888 came to Mr.\r\nBlaine while on a coaching trip with us. Mr. and Mrs. Blaine, Miss\r\nMargaret Blaine, Senator and Mrs. Hale, Miss Dodge, and Walter\r\nDamrosch were on the coach with us from London to Cluny Castle. In\r\napproaching Linlithgow from Edinburgh, we found the provost and\r\nmagistrates in their gorgeous robes at the hotel to receive us. I was\r\nwith them when Mr. Blaine came into the room with a cablegram in his\r\nhand which he showed to me, asking what it meant. It read: \"Use\r\ncipher.\" It was from Senator Elkins at the Chicago Convention. Mr.\r\nBlaine had cabled the previous day, declining to accept the nomination\r\nfor the presidency unless Secretary Sherman of Ohio agreed, and\r\nSenator Elkins no doubt wished to be certain that he was in\r\ncorrespondence with Mr. Blaine and not with some interloper.\r\n\r\nI said to Mr. Blaine that the Senator had called to see me before\r\nsailing, and suggested we should have cipher words for the prominent\r\ncandidates. I gave him a few and kept a copy upon a slip, which I put\r\nin my pocket-book. I looked and fortunately found it. Blaine was\r\n\"Victor\"; Harrison, \"Trump\"; Phelps of New Jersey, \"Star\"; and so on.\r\nI wired \"Trump\" and \"Star.\"[76] This was in the evening.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: \"A code had been agreed upon between his friends in the\r\nUnited States and himself, and when a deadlock or a long contest\r\nseemed inevitable, the following dispatch was sent from Mr. Carnegie's\r\nestate in Scotland, where Blaine was staying, to a prominent\r\nRepublican leader:\r\n\r\n\"'June 25. Too late victor immovable take trump and star.'\r\nWHIP. Interpreted, it reads: 'Too late. Blaine immovable.\r\nTake Harrison and Phelps. CARNEGIE.'\" (_James G. Blaine_, by\r\nEdward Stanwood, p. 308. Boston, 1905.)]\r\n\r\nWe retired for the night, and next day the whole party was paraded by\r\nthe city authorities in their robes up the main street to the palace\r\ngrounds which were finely decorated with flags. Speeches of welcome\r\nwere made and replied to. Mr. Blaine was called upon by the people,\r\nand responded in a short address. Just then a cablegram was handed to\r\nhim: \"Harrison and Morton nominated.\" Phelps had declined. So passed\r\nforever Mr. Blaine's chance of holding the highest of all political\r\noffices--the elected of the majority of the English-speaking race. But\r\nhe was once fairly elected to the presidency and done out of New York\r\nState, as was at last clearly proven, the perpetrators having been\r\npunished for an attempted repetition of the same fraud at a subsequent\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine, as Secretary of State in Harrison's Cabinet, was a decided\r\nsuccess and the Pan-American Congress his most brilliant triumph. My\r\nonly political appointment came at this time and was that of a United\r\nStates delegate to the Congress. It gave me a most interesting view of\r\nthe South American Republics and their various problems. We sat down\r\ntogether, representatives of all the republics but Brazil. One morning\r\nthe announcement was made that a new constitution had been ratified.\r\nBrazil had become a member of the sisterhood, making seventeen\r\nrepublics in all--now twenty-one. There was great applause and cordial\r\ngreeting of the representatives of Brazil thus suddenly elevated. I\r\nfound the South American representatives rather suspicious of their\r\nbig brother's intentions. A sensitive spirit of independence was\r\nmanifest, which it became our duty to recognize. In this I think we\r\nsucceeded, but it will behoove subsequent governments to scrupulously\r\nrespect the national feeling of our Southern neighbors. It is not\r\ncontrol, but friendly coöperation upon terms of perfect equality we\r\nshould seek.\r\n\r\nI sat next to Manuel Quintana who afterwards became President of\r\nArgentina. He took a deep interest in the proceedings, and one day\r\nbecame rather critical upon a trifling issue, which led to an excited\r\ncolloquy between him and Chairman Blaine. I believe it had its origin\r\nin a false translation from one language to another. I rose, slipped\r\nbehind the chairman on the platform, whispering to him as I passed\r\nthat if an adjournment was moved I was certain the differences could\r\nbe adjusted. He nodded assent. I returned to my seat and moved\r\nadjournment, and during the interval all was satisfactorily arranged.\r\nPassing the delegates, as we were about to leave the hall, an incident\r\noccurred which comes back to me as I write. A delegate threw one arm\r\naround me and with the other hand patting me on the breast, exclaimed:\r\n\"Mr. Carnegie, you have more here than here\"--pointing to his pocket.\r\nOur Southern brethren are so lovingly demonstrative. Warm climes and\r\nwarm hearts.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 President Harrison went with me from Washington to Pittsburgh,\r\nas I have already stated, to open the Carnegie Hall and Library, which\r\nI had presented to Allegheny City. We traveled over the Baltimore and\r\nOhio Railroad by daylight, and enjoyed the trip, the president being\r\nespecially pleased with the scenery. Reaching Pittsburgh at dark, the\r\nflaming coke ovens and dense pillars of smoke and fire amazed him. The\r\nwell-known description of Pittsburgh, seen from the hilltops, as \"H--l\r\nwith the lid off,\" seemed to him most appropriate. He was the first\r\nPresident who ever visited Pittsburgh. President Harrison, his\r\ngrandfather, had, however, passed from steamboat to canal-boat there,\r\non his way to Washington after election.\r\n\r\nThe opening ceremony was largely attended owing to the presence of the\r\nPresident and all passed off well. Next morning the President wished\r\nto see our steel works, and he was escorted there, receiving a cordial\r\nwelcome from the workmen. I called up each successive manager of\r\ndepartment as we passed and presented him. Finally, when Mr. Schwab\r\nwas presented, the President turned to me and said,\r\n\r\n\"How is this, Mr. Carnegie? You present only boys to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. President, but do you notice what kind of boys they are?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, hustlers, every one of them,\" was his comment.\r\n\r\nHe was right. No such young men could have been found for such work\r\nelsewhere in this world. They had been promoted to partnership without\r\ncost or risk. If the profits did not pay for their shares, no\r\nresponsibility remained upon the young men. A giving thus to\r\n\"partners\" is very different from paying wages to \"employees\" in\r\ncorporations.\r\n\r\nThe President's visit, not to Pittsburgh, but to Allegheny over the\r\nriver, had one beneficial result. Members of the City Council of\r\nPittsburgh reminded me that I had first offered Pittsburgh money for a\r\nlibrary and hall, which it declined, and that then Allegheny City had\r\nasked if I would give them to her, which I did. The President visiting\r\nAllegheny to open the library and hall there, and the ignoring of\r\nPittsburgh, was too much. Her authorities came to me again the morning\r\nafter the Allegheny City opening, asking if I would renew my offer to\r\nPittsburgh. If so, the city would accept and agree to expend upon\r\nmaintenance a larger percentage than I had previously asked. I was\r\nonly too happy to do this and, instead of two hundred and fifty\r\nthousand, I offered a million dollars. My ideas had expanded. Thus was\r\nstarted the Carnegie Institute.\r\n\r\nPittsburgh's leading citizens are spending freely upon artistic\r\nthings. This center of manufacturing has had its permanent orchestra\r\nfor some years--Boston and Chicago being the only other cities in\r\nAmerica that can boast of one. A naturalist club and a school of\r\npainting have sprung up. The success of Library, Art Gallery, Museum,\r\nand Music Hall--a noble quartet in an immense building--is one of the\r\nchief satisfactions of my life. This is my monument, because here I\r\nlived my early life and made my start, and I am to-day in heart a\r\ndevoted son of dear old smoky Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nHerbert Spencer heard, while with us in Pittsburgh, some account of\r\nthe rejection of my first offer of a library to Pittsburgh. When the\r\nsecond offer was made, he wrote me that he did not understand how I\r\ncould renew it; he never could have done so; they did not deserve it.\r\nI wrote the philosopher that if I had made the first offer to\r\nPittsburgh that I might receive her thanks and gratitude, I deserved\r\nthe personal arrows shot at me and the accusations made that only my\r\nown glorification and a monument to my memory were sought. I should\r\nthen probably have felt as he did. But, as it was the good of the\r\npeople of Pittsburgh I had in view, among whom I had made my fortune,\r\nthe unfounded suspicions of some natures only quickened my desire to\r\nwork their good by planting in their midst a potent influence for\r\nhigher things. This the Institute, thank the kind fates, has done.\r\nPittsburgh has played her part nobly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON DIPLOMACY\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison had been a soldier and as President was a little\r\ndisposed to fight. His attitude gave some of his friends concern. He\r\nwas opposed to arbitrating the Behring Sea question when Lord\r\nSalisbury, at the dictation of Canada, had to repudiate the Blaine\r\nagreement for its settlement, and was disposed to proceed to extreme\r\nmeasures. But calmer counsels prevailed. He was determined also to\r\nuphold the Force Bill against the South.\r\n\r\nWhen the quarrel arose with Chili, there was a time when it seemed\r\nalmost impossible to keep the President from taking action which would\r\nhave resulted in war. He had great personal provocation because the\r\nChilian authorities had been most indiscreet in their statements in\r\nregard to his action. I went to Washington to see whether I could not\r\ndo something toward reconciling the belligerents, because, having been\r\na member of the first Pan-American Conference, I had become acquainted\r\nwith the representatives from our southern sister-republics and was on\r\ngood terms with them.\r\n\r\nAs luck would have it, I was just entering the Shoreham Hotel when I\r\nsaw Senator Henderson of Missouri, who had been my fellow-delegate to\r\nthe Conference. He stopped and greeted me, and looking across the\r\nstreet he said:\r\n\r\n\"There's the President beckoning to you.\"\r\n\r\nI crossed the street.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Carnegie, when did you arrive?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just arrived, Mr. President; I was entering the hotel.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you here for?\"\r\n\r\n\"To have a talk with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, come along and talk as we walk.\"\r\n\r\nThe President took my arm and we promenaded the streets of Washington\r\nin the dusk for more than an hour, during which time the discussion\r\nwas lively. I told him that he had appointed me a delegate to the\r\nPan-American Conference, that he had assured the South-American\r\ndelegates when they parted that he had given a military review in\r\ntheir honor to show them, not that we had an army, but rather that we\r\nhad none and needed none, that we were the big brother in the family\r\nof republics, and that all disputes, if any arose, would be settled by\r\npeaceful arbitration. I was therefore surprised and grieved to find\r\nthat he was now apparently taking a different course, threatening to\r\nresort to war in a paltry dispute with little Chili.\r\n\r\n\"You're a New Yorker and think of nothing but business and dollars.\r\nThat is the way with New Yorkers; they care nothing for the dignity\r\nand honor of the Republic,\" said his Excellency.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, I am one of the men in the United States who would\r\nprofit most by war; it might throw millions into my pockets as the\r\nlargest manufacturer of steel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is probably true in your case; I had forgotten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, if I were going to fight, I would take some one of my\r\nsize.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, would you let any nation insult and dishonor you because of its\r\nsize?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, no man can dishonor me except myself. Honor wounds\r\nmust be self-inflicted.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see our sailors were attacked on shore and two of them killed,\r\nand you would stand that?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, I do not think the United States dishonored every time\r\na row among drunken sailors takes place; besides, these were not\r\nAmerican sailors at all; they were foreigners, as you see by their\r\nnames. I would be disposed to cashier the captain of that ship for\r\nallowing the sailors to go on shore when there was rioting in the town\r\nand the public peace had been already disturbed.\"\r\n\r\nThe discussion continued until we had finally reached the door of the\r\nWhite House in the dark. The President told me he had an engagement to\r\ndine out that night, but invited me to dine with him the next evening,\r\nwhen, as he said, there would be only the family and we could talk.\r\n\r\n\"I am greatly honored and shall be with you to-morrow evening,\" I\r\nsaid. And so we parted.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I went over to see Mr. Blaine, then Secretary of\r\nState. He rose from his seat and held out both hands.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, why weren't you dining with us last night? When the President\r\ntold Mrs. Blaine that you were in town, she said: 'Just think, Mr.\r\nCarnegie is in town and I had a vacant seat here he could have\r\noccupied.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Blaine, I think it is rather fortunate that I have not seen\r\nyou,\" I replied; and I then told him what had occurred with the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"it really was fortunate. The President might have\r\nthought you and I were in collusion.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Elkins, of West Virginia, a bosom friend of Mr. Blaine, and\r\nalso a very good friend of the President, happened to come in, and he\r\nsaid he had seen the President, who told him that he had had a talk\r\nwith me upon the Chilian affair last evening and that I had come down\r\nhot upon the subject.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. President,\" said Senator Elkins, \"it is not probable that\r\nMr. Carnegie would speak as plainly to you as he would to me. He feels\r\nvery keenly, but he would naturally be somewhat reserved in talking to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThe President replied: \"I didn't see the slightest indication of\r\nreserve, I assure you.\"\r\n\r\nThe matter was adjusted, thanks to the peace policy characteristic of\r\nMr. Blaine. More than once he kept the United States out of foreign\r\ntrouble as I personally knew. The reputation that he had of being an\r\naggressive American really enabled that great man to make concessions\r\nwhich, made by another, might not have been readily accepted by the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nI had a long and friendly talk with the President that evening at\r\ndinner, but he was not looking at all well. I ventured to say to him\r\nhe needed a rest. By all means he should get away. He said he had\r\nintended going off on a revenue cutter for a few days, but Judge\r\nBradley of the Supreme Court had died and he must find a worthy\r\nsuccessor. I said there was one I could not recommend because we had\r\nfished together and were such intimate friends that we could not judge\r\neach other disinterestedly, but he might inquire about him--Mr.\r\nShiras, of Pittsburgh. He did so and appointed him. Mr. Shiras\r\nreceived the strong support of the best elements everywhere. Neither\r\nmy recommendation, nor that of any one else, would have weighed with\r\nPresident Harrison one particle in making the appointment if he had\r\nnot found Mr. Shiras the very man he wanted.\r\n\r\nIn the Behring Sea dispute the President was incensed at Lord\r\nSalisbury's repudiation of the stipulations for settling the question\r\nwhich had been agreed to. The President had determined to reject the\r\ncounter-proposition to submit it to arbitration. Mr. Blaine was with\r\nthe President in this and naturally indignant that his plan, which\r\nSalisbury had extolled through his Ambassador, had been discarded. I\r\nfound both of them in no compromising mood. The President was much the\r\nmore excited of the two, however. Talking it over with Mr. Blaine\r\nalone, I explained to him that Salisbury was powerless. Against\r\nCanada's protest he could not force acceptance of the stipulations to\r\nwhich he had hastily agreed. There was another element. He had a\r\ndispute with Newfoundland on hand, which the latter was insisting must\r\nbe settled to her advantage. No Government in Britain could add\r\nCanadian dissatisfaction to that of Newfoundland. Salisbury had done\r\nthe best he could. After a while Blaine was convinced of this and\r\nsucceeded in bringing the President into line.\r\n\r\nThe Behring Sea troubles brought about some rather amusing situations.\r\nOne day Sir John Macdonald, Canadian Premier, and his party reached\r\nWashington and asked Mr. Blaine to arrange an interview with the\r\nPresident upon this subject. Mr. Blaine replied that he would see the\r\nPresident and inform Sir John the next morning.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Mr. Blaine, telling me the story in Washington just\r\nafter the incident occurred, \"I knew very well that the President\r\ncould not meet Sir John and his friends officially, and when they\r\ncalled I told them so.\" Sir John said that Canada was independent, \"as\r\nsovereign as the State of New York was in the Union.\" Mr. Blaine\r\nreplied he was afraid that if he ever obtained an interview as Premier\r\nof Canada with the State authorities of New York he would soon hear\r\nsomething on the subject from Washington; and so would the New York\r\nState authorities.\r\n\r\nIt was because the President and Mr. Blaine were convinced that the\r\nBritish Government at home could not fulfill the stipulations agreed\r\nupon that they accepted Salisbury's proposal for arbitration,\r\nbelieving he had done his best. That was a very sore disappointment to\r\nMr. Blaine. He had suggested that Britain and America should each\r\nplace two small vessels on Behring Sea with equal rights to board or\r\narrest fishing vessels under either flag--in fact, a joint police\r\nforce. To give Salisbury due credit, he cabled the British Ambassador,\r\nSir Julian Pauncefote, to congratulate Mr. Blaine upon this \"brilliant\r\nsuggestion.\" It would have given equal rights to each and under either\r\nor both flags for the first time in history--a just and brotherly\r\ncompact. Sir Julian had shown this cable to Mr. Blaine. I mention this\r\nhere to suggest that able and willing statesmen, anxious to coöperate,\r\nare sometimes unable to do so.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine was indeed a great statesman, a man of wide views, sound\r\njudgment, and always for peace. Upon war with Chili, upon the Force\r\nBill, and the Behring Sea question, he was calm, wise, and\r\npeace-pursuing. Especially was he favorable to drawing closer and\r\ncloser to our own English-speaking race. For France he had gratitude\r\nunbounded for the part she had played in our Revolutionary War, but\r\nthis did not cause him to lose his head.\r\n\r\nOne night at dinner in London Mr. Blaine was at close quarters for a\r\nmoment. The Clayton-Bulwer Treaty came up. A leading statesman present\r\nsaid that the impression they had was that Mr. Blaine had always been\r\ninimical to the Mother country. Mr. Blaine disclaimed this, and justly\r\nso, as far as I knew his sentiments. His correspondence upon the\r\nClayton-Bulwer Treaty was instanced. Mr. Blaine replied:\r\n\r\n\"When I became Secretary of State and had to take up that subject I\r\nwas surprised to find that your Secretary for Foreign Affairs was\r\nalways informing us what Her Majesty 'expected,' while our Secretary\r\nof State was telling you what our President 'ventured to hope.' When I\r\nreceived a dispatch telling us what Her Majesty expected, I replied,\r\ntelling you what our President 'expected.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you admit you changed the character of the correspondence?\" was\r\nshot at him.\r\n\r\nQuick as a flash came the response: \"Not more than conditions had\r\nchanged. The United States had passed the stage of 'venturing to hope'\r\nwith any power that 'expects.' I only followed your example, and\r\nshould ever Her Majesty 'venture to hope,' the President will always\r\nbe found doing the same. I am afraid that as long as you 'expect' the\r\nUnited States will also 'expect' in return.\"\r\n\r\nOne night there was a dinner, where Mr. Joseph Chamberlain and Sir\r\nCharles Tennant, President of the Scotland Steel Company, were guests.\r\nDuring the evening the former said that his friend Carnegie was a good\r\nfellow and they all delighted to see him succeeding, but he didn't\r\nknow why the United States should give him protection worth a million\r\nsterling per year or more, for condescending to manufacture steel\r\nrails.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Blaine, \"we don't look at it in that light. I am\r\ninterested in railroads, and we formerly used to pay you for steel\r\nrails ninety dollars per ton for every ton we got--nothing less. Now,\r\njust before I sailed from home our people made a large contract with\r\nour friend Carnegie at thirty dollars per ton. I am somewhat under\r\nthe impression that if Carnegie and others had not risked their\r\ncapital in developing their manufacture on our side of the Atlantic,\r\nwe would still be paying you ninety dollars per ton to-day.\"\r\n\r\nHere Sir Charles broke in: \"You may be sure you would. Ninety dollars\r\nwas our agreed-upon price for you foreigners.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine smilingly remarked: \"Mr. Chamberlain, I don't think you\r\nhave made a very good case against our friend Carnegie.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he replied; \"how could I, with Sir Charles giving me away like\r\nthat?\"--and there was general laughter.\r\n\r\nBlaine was a rare raconteur and his talk had this great merit: never\r\ndid I hear him tell a story or speak a word unsuitable for any, even\r\nthe most fastidious company to hear. He was as quick as a steel trap,\r\na delightful companion, and he would have made an excellent and yet\r\nsafe President. I found him truly conservative, and strong for peace\r\nupon all international questions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKIBO CASTLE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nHAY AND McKINLEY\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Hay was our frequent guest in England and Scotland, and was on\r\nthe eve of coming to us at Skibo in 1898 when called home by President\r\nMcKinley to become Secretary of State. Few have made such a record in\r\nthat office. He inspired men with absolute confidence in his\r\nsincerity, and his aspirations were always high. War he detested, and\r\nmeant what he said when he pronounced it \"the most ferocious and yet\r\nthe most futile folly of man.\"\r\n\r\nThe Philippines annexation was a burning question when I met him and\r\nHenry White (Secretary of Legation and later Ambassador to France) in\r\nLondon, on my way to New York. It gratified me to find our views were\r\nsimilar upon that proposed serious departure from our traditional\r\npolicy of avoiding distant and disconnected possessions and keeping\r\nour empire within the continent, especially keeping it out of the\r\nvortex of militarism. Hay, White, and I clasped hands together in\r\nHay's office in London, and agreed upon this. Before that he had\r\nwritten me the following note:\r\n\r\n     _London, August 22, 1898_\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR CARNEGIE:\r\n\r\n     I thank you for the Skibo grouse and also for your kind\r\n     letter. It is a solemn and absorbing thing to hear so many\r\n     kind and unmerited words as I have heard and read this last\r\n     week. It seems to me another man they are talking about,\r\n     while I am expected to do the work. I wish a little of the\r\n     kindness could be saved till I leave office finally.\r\n\r\n     I have read with the keenest interest your article in the\r\n     \"North American.\"[77] I am not allowed to say in my present\r\n     fix how much I agree with you. The only question on my mind\r\n     is how far it is now _possible_ for us to withdraw from the\r\n     Philippines. I am rather thankful it is not given to me to\r\n     solve that momentous question.[78]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: The reference is to an article by Mr. Carnegie in the\r\n_North American Review_, August, 1898, entitled: \"Distant\r\nPossessions--The Parting of the Ways.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: Published in Thayer, _Life and Letters of John Hay_,\r\nvol. II, p. 175. Boston and New York, 1915.]\r\n\r\nIt was a strange fate that placed upon him the very task he had\r\ncongratulated himself was never to be his.\r\n\r\nHe stood alone at first as friendly to China in the Boxer troubles and\r\nsucceeded in securing for her fair terms of peace. His regard for\r\nBritain, as part of our own race, was deep, and here the President was\r\nthoroughly with him, and grateful beyond measure to Britain for\r\nstanding against other European powers disposed to favor Spain in the\r\nCuban War.\r\n\r\nThe Hay-Pauncefote Treaty concerning the Panama Canal seemed to many\r\nof us unsatisfactory. Senator Elkins told me my objections, given in\r\nthe \"New York Tribune,\" reached him the day he was to speak upon it,\r\nand were useful. Visiting Washington soon after the article appeared,\r\nI went with Senator Hanna to the White House early in the morning and\r\nfound the President much exercised over the Senate's amendment to the\r\ntreaty. I had no doubt of Britain's prompt acquiescence in the\r\nSenate's requirements, and said so. Anything in reason she would give,\r\nsince it was we who had to furnish the funds for the work from which\r\nshe would be, next to ourselves, the greatest gainer.\r\n\r\nSenator Hanna asked if I had seen \"John,\" as he and President McKinley\r\nalways called Mr. Hay. I said I had not. Then he asked me to go over\r\nand cheer him up, for he was disconsolate about the amendments. I did\r\nso. I pointed out to Mr. Hay that the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty had been\r\namended by the Senate and scarcely any one knew this now and no one\r\ncared. The Hay-Pauncefote Treaty would be executed as amended and no\r\none would care a fig whether it was in its original form or not. He\r\ndoubted this and thought Britain would be indisposed to recede. A\r\nshort time after this, dining with him, he said I had proved a true\r\nprophet and all was well.\r\n\r\nOf course it was. Britain had practically told us she wished the canal\r\nbuilt and would act in any way desired. The canal is now as it should\r\nbe--that is, all American, with no international complications\r\npossible. It was perhaps not worth building at that time, but it was\r\nbetter to spend three or four hundred millions upon it than in\r\nbuilding sea monsters of destruction to fight imaginary foes. One may\r\nbe a loss and there an end; the other might be a source of war, for\r\n\r\n    \"Oft the sight of means to do ill deeds\r\n    Make deeds ill done.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hay's _bête noire_ was the Senate. Upon this, and this only, was\r\nhe disregardful of the proprieties. When it presumed to alter one\r\nword, substituting \"treaty\" for \"agreement,\" which occurred in one\r\nplace only in the proposed Arbitration Treaty of 1905, he became\r\nunduly excited. I believe this was owing in great degree to poor\r\nhealth, for it was clear by that time to intimate friends that his\r\nhealth was seriously impaired.\r\n\r\nThe last time I saw him was at lunch at his house, when the\r\nArbitration Treaty, as amended by the Senate, was under the\r\nconsideration of President Roosevelt. The arbitrationists, headed by\r\nex-Secretary of State Foster, urged the President's acceptance of the\r\namended treaty. We thought he was favorable to this, but from my\r\nsubsequent talk with Secretary Hay, I saw that the President's\r\nagreeing would be keenly felt. I should not be surprised if\r\nRoosevelt's rejection of the treaty was resolved upon chiefly to\r\nsoothe his dear friend John Hay in his illness. I am sure I felt that\r\nI could be brought to do, only with the greatest difficulty, anything\r\nthat would annoy that noble soul. But upon this point Hay was\r\nobdurate; no surrender to the Senate. Leaving his house I said to Mrs.\r\nCarnegie that I doubted if ever we should meet our friend again. We\r\nnever did.\r\n\r\nThe Carnegie Institution of Washington, of which Hay was the chairman\r\nand a trustee from the start, received his endorsement and close\r\nattention, and much were we indebted to him for wise counsel. As a\r\nstatesman he made his reputation in shorter time and with a surer\r\ntouch than any one I know of. And it may be doubted if any public man\r\never had more deeply attached friends. One of his notes I have long\r\nkept. It would have been the most flattering of any to my literary\r\nvanity but for my knowledge of his most lovable nature and undue\r\nwarmth for his friends. The world is poorer to me to-day as I write,\r\nsince he has left it.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish War was the result of a wave of passion started by the\r\nreports of the horrors of the Cuban Revolution. President McKinley\r\ntried hard to avoid it. When the Spanish Minister left Washington, the\r\nFrench Ambassador became Spain's agent, and peaceful negotiations were\r\ncontinued. Spain offered autonomy for Cuba. The President replied that\r\nhe did not know exactly what \"autonomy\" meant. What he wished for Cuba\r\nwas the rights that Canada possessed. He understood these. A cable was\r\nshown to the President by the French Minister stating that Spain\r\ngranted this and he, dear man, supposed all was settled. So it was,\r\napparently.\r\n\r\nSpeaker Reed usually came to see me Sunday mornings when in New York,\r\nand it was immediately after my return from Europe that year that he\r\ncalled and said he had never lost control of the House before. For one\r\nmoment he thought of leaving the chair and going on the floor to\r\naddress the House and try to quiet it. In vain it was explained that\r\nthe President had received from Spain the guarantee of self-government\r\nfor Cuba. Alas! it was too late, too late!\r\n\r\n\"What is Spain doing over here, anyhow?\" was the imperious inquiry of\r\nCongress. A sufficient number of Republicans had agreed to vote with\r\nthe Democrats in Congress for war. A whirlwind of passion swept over\r\nthe House, intensified, no doubt, by the unfortunate explosion of the\r\nwarship Maine in Havana Harbor, supposed by some to be Spanish work.\r\nThe supposition gave Spain far too much credit for skill and activity.\r\n\r\nWar was declared--the Senate being shocked by Senator Proctor's\r\nstatement of the concentration camps he had seen in Cuba. The country\r\nresponded to the cry, \"What is Spain doing over here anyhow?\"\r\nPresident McKinley and his peace policy were left high and dry, and\r\nnothing remained for him but to go with the country. The Government\r\nthen announced that war was not undertaken for territorial\r\naggrandizement, and Cuba was promised independence--a promise\r\nfaithfully kept. We should not fail to remember this, for it is the\r\none cheering feature of the war.\r\n\r\nThe possession of the Philippines left a stain. They were not only\r\nterritorial acquisition; they were dragged from reluctant Spain and\r\ntwenty million dollars paid for them. The Filipinos had been our\r\nallies in fighting Spain. The Cabinet, under the lead of the\r\nPresident, had agreed that only a coaling station in the Philippines\r\nshould be asked for, and it is said such were the instructions given\r\nby cable at first to the Peace Commissioners at Paris. President\r\nMcKinley then made a tour through the West and, of course, was cheered\r\nwhen he spoke of the flag and Dewey's victory. He returned, impressed\r\nwith the idea that withdrawal would be unpopular, and reversed his\r\nformer policy. I was told by one of his Cabinet that every member was\r\nopposed to the reversal. A senator told me Judge Day, one of the Peace\r\nCommissioners, wrote a remonstrance from Paris, which if ever\r\npublished, would rank next to Washington's Farewell Address, so fine\r\nwas it.\r\n\r\nAt this stage an important member of the Cabinet, my friend Cornelius\r\nN. Bliss, called and asked me to visit Washington and see the\r\nPresident on the subject. He said:\r\n\r\n\"You have influence with him. None of us have been able to move him\r\nsince he returned from the West.\"\r\n\r\nI went to Washington and had an interview with him. But he was\r\nobdurate. Withdrawal would create a revolution at home, he said.\r\nFinally, by persuading his secretaries that he had to bend to the\r\nblast, and always holding that it would be only a temporary occupation\r\nand that a way out would be found, the Cabinet yielded.\r\n\r\nHe sent for President Schurman, of Cornell University, who had opposed\r\nannexation and made him chairman of the committee to visit the\r\nFilipinos; and later for Judge Taft, who had been prominent against\r\nsuch a violation of American policy, to go as Governor. When the Judge\r\nstated that it seemed strange to send for one, who had publicly\r\ndenounced annexation, the President said that was the very reason why\r\nhe wished him for the place. This was all very well, but to refrain\r\nfrom annexing and to relinquish territory once purchased are different\r\npropositions. This was soon seen.\r\n\r\nMr. Bryan had it in his power at one time to defeat in the Senate this\r\nfeature of the Treaty of Peace with Spain. I went to Washington to try\r\nto effect this, and remained there until the vote was taken. I was\r\ntold that when Mr. Bryan was in Washington he had advised his friends\r\nthat it would be good party policy to allow the treaty to pass. This\r\nwould discredit the Republican Party before the people; that \"paying\r\ntwenty millions for a revolution\" would defeat any party. There were\r\nseven staunch Bryan men anxious to vote against Philippine annexation.\r\n\r\nMr. Bryan had called to see me in New York upon the subject, because\r\nmy opposition to the purchase had been so pronounced, and I now wired\r\nhim at Omaha explaining the situation and begging him to wire me that\r\nhis friends could use their own judgment. His reply was what I have\r\nstated--better have the Republicans pass it and let it then go before\r\nthe people. I thought it unworthy of him to subordinate such an issue,\r\nfraught with deplorable consequences, to mere party politics. It\r\nrequired the casting vote of the Speaker to carry the measure. One\r\nword from Mr. Bryan would have saved the country from the disaster. I\r\ncould not be cordial to him for years afterwards. He had seemed to me\r\na man who was willing to sacrifice his country and his personal\r\nconvictions for party advantage.\r\n\r\nWhen I called upon President McKinley immediately after the vote, I\r\ncondoled with him upon being dependent for support upon his leading\r\nopponent. I explained just how his victory had been won and suggested\r\nthat he should send his grateful acknowledgments to Mr. Bryan. A\r\nColonial possession thousands of miles away was a novel problem to\r\nPresident McKinley, and indeed to all American statesmen. Nothing did\r\nthey know of the troubles and dangers it would involve. Here the\r\nRepublic made its first grievous international mistake--a mistake\r\nwhich dragged it into the vortex of international militarism and a\r\ngreat navy. What a change has come over statesmen since!\r\n\r\nAt supper with President Roosevelt at the White House a few weeks ago\r\n(1907), he said:\r\n\r\n\"If you wish to see the two men in the United States who are the most\r\nanxious to get out of the Philippines, here they are,\" pointing to\r\nSecretary Taft and himself.\r\n\r\n\"Then why don't you?\" I responded. \"The American people would be glad\r\nindeed.\"\r\n\r\nBut both the President and Judge Taft believed our duty required us to\r\nprepare the Islands for self-government first. This is the policy of\r\n\"Don't go into the water until you learn to swim.\" But the plunge has\r\nto be and will be taken some day.\r\n\r\nIt was urged that if we did not occupy the Philippines, Germany would.\r\nIt never occurred to the urgers that this would mean Britain agreeing\r\nthat Germany should establish a naval base at Macao, a short sail from\r\nBritain's naval base in the East. Britain would as soon permit her to\r\nestablish a base at Kingston, Ireland, eighty miles from Liverpool. I\r\nwas surprised to hear men--men like Judge Taft, although he was\r\nopposed at first to the annexation--give this reason when we were\r\ndiscussing the question after the fatal step had been taken. But we\r\nknow little of foreign relations. We have hitherto been a consolidated\r\ncountry. It will be a sad day if we ever become anything otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nMEETING THE GERMAN EMPEROR\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first Rectorial Address to the students of St. Andrews University\r\nattracted the attention of the German Emperor, who sent word to me in\r\nNew York by Herr Ballin that he had read every word of it. He also\r\nsent me by him a copy of his address upon his eldest son's\r\nconsecration. Invitations to meet him followed; but it was not until\r\nJune, 1907, that I could leave, owing to other engagements. Mrs.\r\nCarnegie and I went to Kiel. Mr. Tower, our American Ambassador to\r\nGermany, and Mrs. Tower met us there and were very kind in their\r\nattentions. Through them we met many of the distinguished public men\r\nduring our three days' stay there.\r\n\r\nThe first morning, Mr. Tower took me to register on the Emperor's\r\nyacht. I had no expectation of seeing the Emperor, but he happened to\r\ncome on deck, and seeing Mr. Tower he asked what had brought him on\r\nthe yacht so early. Mr. Tower explained he had brought me over to\r\nregister, and that Mr. Carnegie was on board. He asked:\r\n\r\n\"Why not present him now? I wish to see him.\"\r\n\r\nI was talking to the admirals who were assembling for a conference,\r\nand did not see Mr. Tower and the Emperor approaching from behind. A\r\ntouch on my shoulder and I turned around.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Carnegie, the Emperor.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a moment before I realized that the Emperor was before me. I\r\nraised both hands, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"This has happened just as I could have wished, with no ceremony, and\r\nthe Man of Destiny dropped from the clouds.\"\r\n\r\nThen I continued: \"Your Majesty, I have traveled two nights to accept\r\nyour generous invitation, and never did so before to meet a crowned\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\nThen the Emperor, smiling--and such a captivating smile:\r\n\r\n\"Oh! yes, yes, I have read your books. You do not like kings.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Your Majesty, I do not like kings, but I do like a man behind a\r\nking when I find him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! there is one king you like, I know, a Scottish king, Robert the\r\nBruce. He was my hero in my youth. I was brought up on him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Your Majesty, so was I, and he lies buried in Dunfermline Abbey,\r\nin my native town. When a boy, I used to walk often around the\r\ntowering square monument on the Abbey--one word on each block in big\r\nstone letters 'King Robert the Bruce'--with all the fervor of a\r\nCatholic counting his beads. But Bruce was much more than a king, Your\r\nMajesty, he was the leader of his people. And not the first; Wallace\r\nthe man of the people comes first. Your Majesty, I now own King\r\nMalcolm's tower in Dunfermline[79]--he from whom you derive your\r\nprecious heritage of Scottish blood. Perhaps you know the fine old\r\nballad, 'Sir Patrick Spens.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: In the deed of trust conveying Pittencrieff Park and\r\nGlen to Dunfermline an unspecified reservation of property was made.\r\nThe \"with certain exceptions\" related to King Malcolm's Tower. For\r\nreasons best known to himself Mr. Carnegie retained the ownership of\r\nthis relic of the past.]\r\n\r\n    \"'The King sits in Dunfermline tower\r\n    Drinking the bluid red wine.'\r\n\r\nI should like to escort you some day to the tower of your Scottish\r\nancestor, that you may do homage to his memory.\" He exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"That would be very fine. The Scotch are much quicker and cleverer\r\nthan the Germans. The Germans are too slow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty, where anything Scotch is concerned, I must decline to\r\naccept you as an impartial judge.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed and waved adieu, calling out:\r\n\r\n\"You are to dine with me this evening\"--and excusing himself went to\r\ngreet the arriving admirals.\r\n\r\nAbout sixty were present at the dinner and we had a pleasant time,\r\nindeed. His Majesty, opposite whom I sat, was good enough to raise his\r\nglass and invite me to drink with him. After he had done so with Mr.\r\nTower, our Ambassador, who sat at his right, he asked across the\r\ntable--heard by those near--whether I had told Prince von Bülow, next\r\nwhom I sat, that his (the Emperor's) hero, Bruce, rested in my native\r\ntown of Dunfermline, and his ancestor's tower in Pittencrieff Glen,\r\nwas in my possession.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I replied; \"with Your Majesty I am led into such frivolities,\r\nbut my intercourse with your Lord High Chancellor, I assure you, will\r\nalways be of a serious import.\"\r\n\r\nWe dined with Mrs. Goelet upon her yacht, one evening, and His Majesty\r\nbeing present, I told him President Roosevelt had said recently to me\r\nthat he wished custom permitted him to leave the country so he could\r\nrun over and see him (the Emperor). He thought a substantial talk\r\nwould result in something good being accomplished. I believed that\r\nalso. The Emperor agreed and said he wished greatly to see him and\r\nhoped he would some day come to Germany. I suggested that he (the\r\nEmperor) was free from constitutional barriers and could sail over\r\nand see the President.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but my country needs me here! How can I leave?\"\r\n\r\nI replied:\r\n\r\n\"Before leaving home one year, when I went to our mills to bid the\r\nofficials good-bye and expressed regret at leaving them all hard at\r\nwork, sweltering in the hot sun, but that I found I had now every year\r\nto rest and yet no matter how tired I might be one half-hour on the\r\nbow of the steamer, cutting the Atlantic waves, gave me perfect\r\nrelief, my clever manager, Captain Jones, retorted: 'And, oh, Lord!\r\nthink of the relief we all get.' It might be the same with your\r\npeople, Your Majesty.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed heartily over and over again. It opened a new train of\r\nthought. He repeated his desire to meet President Roosevelt, and I\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Your Majesty, when you two do get together, I think I shall\r\nhave to be with you. You and he, I fear, might get into mischief.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed and said:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I see! You wish to drive us together. Well, I agree if you make\r\nRoosevelt first horse, I shall follow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, no, Your Majesty, I know horse-flesh better than to attempt to\r\ndrive two such gay colts tandem. You never get proper purchase on the\r\nfirst horse. I must yoke you both in the shafts, neck and neck, so I\r\ncan hold you in.\"\r\n\r\nI never met a man who enjoyed stories more keenly than the Emperor. He\r\nis fine company, and I believe an earnest man, anxious for the peace\r\nand progress of the world. Suffice it to say he insists that he is,\r\nand always has been, for peace. [1907.] He cherishes the fact that he\r\nhas reigned for twenty-four years and has never shed human blood. He\r\nconsiders that the German navy is too small to affect the British and\r\nwas never intended to be a rival. Nevertheless, it is in my opinion\r\nvery unwise, because unnecessary, to enlarge it. Prince von Bülow\r\nholds these sentiments and I believe the peace of the world has little\r\nto fear from Germany. Her interests are all favorable to peace,\r\nindustrial development being her aim; and in this desirable field she\r\nis certainly making great strides.\r\n\r\nI sent the Emperor by his Ambassador, Baron von Sternberg, the book,\r\n\"The Roosevelt Policy,\"[80] to which I had written an introduction\r\nthat pleased the President, and I rejoice in having received from him\r\na fine bronze of himself with a valued letter. He is not only an\r\nEmperor, but something much higher--a man anxious to improve existing\r\nconditions, untiring in his efforts to promote temperance, prevent\r\ndueling, and, I believe, to secure International Peace.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: _The Roosevelt Policy: Speeches, Letters and State\r\nPapers relating to Corporate Wealth and closely Allied Topics._ New\r\nYork, 1908.]\r\n\r\nI have for some time been haunted with the feeling that the Emperor\r\nwas indeed a Man of Destiny. My interviews with him have strengthened\r\nthat feeling. I have great hopes of him in the future doing something\r\nreally great and good. He may yet have a part to play that will give\r\nhim a place among the immortals. He has ruled Germany in peace for\r\ntwenty-seven years, but something beyond even this record is due from\r\none who has the power to establish peace among civilized nations\r\nthrough positive action. Maintaining peace in his own land is not\r\nsufficient from one whose invitation to other leading civilized\r\nnations to combine and establish arbitration of all international\r\ndisputes would be gladly responded to. Whether he is to pass into\r\nhistory as only the preserver of internal peace at home or is to\r\nrise to his appointed mission as the Apostle of Peace among leading\r\ncivilized nations, the future has still to reveal.\r\n\r\nThe year before last (1912) I stood before him in the grand palace in\r\nBerlin and presented the American address of congratulation upon his\r\npeaceful reign of twenty-five years, his hand unstained by human\r\nblood. As I approached to hand to him the casket containing the\r\naddress, he recognized me and with outstretched arms, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Carnegie, twenty-five years of peace, and we hope for many more.\"\r\n\r\nI could not help responding:\r\n\r\n\"And in this noblest of all missions you are our chief ally.\"\r\n\r\nHe had hitherto sat silent and motionless, taking the successive\r\naddresses from one officer and handing them to another to be placed\r\nupon the table. The chief subject under discussion had been World\r\nPeace, which he could have, and in my opinion, would have secured, had\r\nhe not been surrounded by the military caste which inevitably gathers\r\nabout one born to the throne--a caste which usually becomes as\r\npermanent as the potentate himself, and which has so far in Germany\r\nproved its power of control whenever the war issue has been presented.\r\nUntil militarism is subordinated, there can be no World Peace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs I read this to-day [1914], what a change! The world convulsed by\r\nwar as never before! Men slaying each other like wild beasts! I dare\r\nnot relinquish all hope. In recent days I see another ruler coming\r\nforward upon the world stage, who may prove himself the immortal one.\r\nThe man who vindicated his country's honor in the Panama Canal toll\r\ndispute is now President. He has the indomitable will of genius, and\r\ntrue hope which we are told,\r\n\r\n    \"Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.\"\r\n\r\nNothing is impossible to genius! Watch President Wilson! He has Scotch\r\nblood in his veins.\r\n\r\n[Here the manuscript ends abruptly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANDREW CARNEGIE AT SKIBO\r\n\r\n(1914)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY AND INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nMR.
