BENTLEY, WILSON, and FLEY\r\n  Bangor House, Shoe Lane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEMOIRS OF THE REIGN OF KING GEORGE THE THIRD, by Horace Walpole\r\n(Earl of Orford), now for the first time submitted to the Public, are\r\nprinted from a manuscript copy contained in the box of papers which\r\ncame into the possession of the late Earl of Waldegrave, under the\r\ncircumstances stated in the Preface to “The Memoires of the Last Twelve\r\nYears of the Reign of George the Second.” This manuscript was placed by\r\nLord Waldegrave in the hands of the late Lord Holland at the same time\r\nwith “the Memoires” last mentioned, and hopes were long entertained\r\nthat it would have had the advantage of the editorial care which gave\r\nso much additional interest to that work; but from the date of Lord\r\nHolland’s return to office, in 1830, the little leisure he could find\r\nfor literary pursuits was diverted from these volumes by engagements of\r\na more pressing character; and it appeared at his death that he had\r\nnever even commenced the task which he was of all persons eminently\r\nqualified to execute. Under these circumstances Lord Euston (now Duke\r\nof Grafton) on whom the property of the manuscript had devolved, as\r\nLord Waldegrave’s executor, became very desirous that the publication\r\nshould no longer be deferred; and happening to consult me on the\r\nsubject, my interest was so much excited by a cursory perusal, that I\r\nacceded to the request made to me to prepare the Work for the press.\r\nIn this I was further encouraged by the assurance I received of the\r\nzealous co-operation and assistance of the late Mr. John Allen, whose\r\nknowledge of the early years of George the Third’s reign was surpassed\r\nby none of his contemporaries (excepting, perhaps, Lord Holland),\r\nand whose participation in all the studies, and I might almost add\r\nidentification with the literary pursuits of that nobleman, would have\r\ngiven me many of the advantages I should have derived from himself, had\r\nhe been still living. I had several conversations with Mr. Allen on the\r\nplan to be pursued in editing the Work, and his hints on the characters\r\nof the individuals described in it were of essential service to me; but\r\nunhappily, before my labours had commenced in earnest, he was taken\r\nill, and in a few days followed his friend and patron to the grave.\r\nFew of the associates of his latter days valued him more than myself,\r\nor more deeply regretted his loss; and in revising these pages, my mind\r\nhas often recurred with melancholy yet grateful satisfaction to the\r\nmany agreeable and most instructive hours I have passed in his and Lord\r\nHolland’s society at a house which has acquired an European celebrity\r\nas the great point of intellectual and moral reunion among the most\r\ndistinguished political and literary men of the present century.\r\n\r\nThese Memoirs comprise the first twelve years of the reign of George\r\nthe Third, and close the historical works of Horace Walpole. “On their\r\nmerits,” to use the words of Lord Holland,[1] “it would be improper\r\nto enlarge in this place. That they contain much curious and original\r\ninformation, will not be disputed.” In common with the Memoires of\r\nGeorge the Second, “they treat of a part of our annals most imperfectly\r\nknown to us,” with the decided advantage of the period being one marked\r\nby events of deeper interest and more congenial in their character\r\nand bearings with those which have since engaged, and still occupy\r\nour attention. The contests between Whigs and Jacobites may not be\r\nundeserving our curiosity; yet they sink into insignificance when\r\ncompared with the origin and progress of the American discontents,\r\nin which may be traced the first indistinct rudiments of the great\r\nantagonistic principles and social revolutions of our own time.\r\nThe Parliamentary struggles, too, in the case of General Warrants,\r\nare important, not less on account of the stores of constitutional\r\nknowledge they elicited, than from the spirit of free inquiry into\r\nthe Prerogatives of the Crown on the one hand and the Privileges of\r\nthe People on the other, which necessarily sprang out of them. Nor\r\nis it an uninstructive lesson to observe the efforts made by George\r\nthe Third to break up the political parties which had embarrassed the\r\nreign of his predecessor. These topics are among the most prominent\r\nin the History of England during the Eighteenth Century, and they\r\nconstitute the staple of the present Work. Some of the best debates\r\non the Stamp Act, and on the proceedings against Mr. Wilkes, are\r\nhere reported with a vivacity and apparent correctness which may be\r\nsought in vain elsewhere; and we meet throughout the Work the same\r\nabundance of anecdote, and the same graphic description of men and\r\nmanners, that characterise the Memoires of George the Second. It\r\ngives even more copious details of the negotiations between political\r\nparties, especially those incidental to the fall of Lord Rockingham’s\r\nAdministration; the gradual alienation of that nobleman and his\r\nfriends from the Duke of Grafton; and the other divisions among the\r\nWhig party, which ended in the long enjoyment of power by their\r\nopponents. The records of these transactions do not, it is true, form\r\nthe most dignified department of the historian, but political history\r\nis necessarily incomplete without them; and here Walpole is on his\r\nown ground. Unlike most of the writers who have minutely chronicled\r\ntheir times, he can neither be charged with obtaining mere imperfect\r\nor occasional glances into the councils of men in power, nor with\r\nsuffering himself to be shackled by a sense of official restraint, not\r\nto say responsibility. He possessed entirely the secret of affairs,\r\nat least as long as Conway remained Minister; and so unreservedly\r\ndiscloses what he knew, that he might not untruly boast, as he does\r\nelsewhere, “that the failings of some of his nearest friends are as\r\nlittle concealed as those of other persons.”[2]\r\n\r\nI have little to add concerning my own share in these Memoirs. They\r\nare printed exactly as the Author left them, except that it has been\r\nthought right to suppress a few passages of an indecent tendency; and\r\nfollowing the example of Lord Holland, “two or three passages affecting\r\nthe private characters of private persons, and in no ways connected\r\nwith any political event, or illustrative of any great public\r\ncharacter, have been omitted.”[3]\r\n\r\nThe notes that occur without any distinguishing mark were left by the\r\nAuthor. It will be perceived that they seldom extend beyond a brief\r\nstatement of the rank or relationship of the individuals noticed in the\r\ntext. All the other notes are mine.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a wish generally expressed after the publication\r\nof the “Memoires of the Last Twelve Years of the Reign of George the\r\nSecond,” for additional information respecting many of the characters\r\ndescribed in that work, I have enlarged on the meagre notices left\r\nby Walpole, and endeavoured to correct his errors--taking, as my\r\nmodel, the annotations of Lord Dover and Mr. Wright on the Author’s\r\ncorrespondence. My references to those popular works will be found to\r\nhave been frequent, and I can venture to add my testimony to their\r\nimpartiality and correctness.[4] I may have unconsciously borrowed\r\nfrom them, where we are treating of the same individuals; but I have\r\nendeavoured, as much as possible, to steer an independent course, and\r\nthe subject is sufficiently wide to admit of it. I have also carefully\r\nconsulted all the contemporary authorities within my reach, and, in\r\nmore than one instance, have received valuable communications from\r\npersons who either lived near the times described by Walpole, or were\r\nactually acquainted with him. My sole object, however, has been to\r\ncontribute to the information of readers hitherto little conversant\r\nwith the events and characters of the period under our notice. More\r\ndetailed criticism on particular transactions, and some biographical\r\nsketches, too long for insertion in the notes, will be given in the\r\nAppendix to the Fourth Volume; but I have no pretensions to encroach on\r\nthe province of the historian--especially since the publication of the\r\nlast volume of Lord Mahon’s History of George the Third, and the recent\r\narticle on Lord Chatham in the Edinburgh Review, both of which have\r\nappeared since this Work went to the press.\r\n\r\nIt was at first expected that this Work would be comprised in three\r\nvolumes, but a more careful examination of the manuscript having proved\r\na fourth to be indispensable, it is thought best not to delay the\r\npublication of the two volumes already printed, and to reserve the two\r\nconcluding volumes until early in the Spring.\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge much kindness from various friends in the\r\nprosecution of my inquiries. Sir Edward Colebrooke, in particular,\r\nhas favoured me with the loan of the manuscript autobiography of his\r\ngrandfather, Sir George Colebrooke, M. P., Chairman of the East India\r\nCompany, an active politician, who lived on confidential terms with\r\nthe Duke of Newcastle, Lord Rockingham, and Mr. Charles Townshend; and\r\nI am indebted to Sir George Larpent for the perusal of the papers of\r\nhis father, when Secretary to Lord Hertford, during the embassy of the\r\nlatter at Paris.\r\n\r\n            DENIS LE MARCHANT.\r\n\r\n  7, HARLEY STREET,\r\n      _December 4, 1844_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A.

It was no ambition, or spirit of faction, that engaged\r\nme in them again. Inconstancy, or weariness of retirement, were as\r\nlittle the motives of my return to action. I am going to set forth\r\nthe true causes; and if I am obliged to make more frequent mention of\r\nmyself than I should wish to do, it will be from the necessity I am\r\nunder of unfolding the secret springs of many events in which I was\r\nunwillingly a considerable actor. It is to gratify no vanity that I\r\nrelate them: my portion was not brilliant. And though my counsels might\r\nhave been more serviceable to my country and to my friends, if they had\r\nbeen more followed, they were calculated to produce neither glory nor\r\nprofit to myself, and were much oftener neglected than listened to. Nor\r\nshould they be remembered here, if many miscarriages had not accrued\r\nfrom the neglect of them, as was felt and confessed by those to whom\r\nthey had been suggested.\r\n\r\nHow far I have been in the right or in the wrong, I leave to the\r\njudgment of posterity, who shall be impartially informed; and who may\r\ndraw some benefit from the knowledge of what I have seen; though few\r\npersons, I believe, profit much from history. Times seldom resemble one\r\nanother enough to be very applicable; and if they do, the characters\r\nof the actors are very different. They, too, who read history most,\r\nare seldom performers in the political drama. Yet they who have\r\nperformed any part in it, are at least able to give the best account\r\nof it, though still an imperfect one. No man is acquainted with the\r\nwhole plot; as no man knows all the secret springs of the actions of\r\nothers. His passions and prejudices warp his judgment, and cast a mist\r\nbefore the most penetrating sagacity. Yet, partial as the narratives\r\nof the actors must be, they will certainly approach nearer to truth\r\nthan those of spectators, who, beholding nothing but events, pretend\r\nto account for them from causes which they can but suppose, and which\r\nfrequently never existed. It is this assistance to history which I now\r\noffer, and by which I may explain some passages, which might otherwise\r\nnever be cleared up.\r\n\r\nI have a new reason for repeating here, what I have said in former\r\npages, that these are memoirs, not history. The inequality, and perhaps\r\neven the contradictory opinions which may appear in them from being\r\nwritten at different periods, forbid this work to aim at the regular\r\nmarch of history. As I knew men more, I may have altered my sentiments\r\nof them;--they themselves may have changed. If I had any personal\r\ncauses for changing my opinion, I have told them fairly, that the\r\nfault may be imputed to my passions, rather than to those I speak of.\r\nThe actions of the persons must determine whether they altered, or I\r\nwas prejudiced. But, though this dissonance may cast unequal colours\r\non my work, I choose to leave it as I wrote it, having at each period\r\nspoken truth as it appeared to me. I might have made it more uniform\r\nby correction; but the natural colouring would have been lost; and I\r\nshould rather have composed than written a history. As it stands an\r\noriginal sketch, it is at least a picture of my own mind and opinions.\r\nThat sketch may be valuable to a few, who study human nature even in a\r\nsingle character.\r\n\r\nBut I will make no farther apology for a work which I am sensible has\r\nmany faults; which I again declare I do not give as a history; and to\r\nwhich, if it has not merits sufficient to atone for its blemishes,\r\nI desire no quarter may be given. Remember, reader, I offer you no\r\nmore than the memoirs of men who had many faults, written by a man\r\nwho had many himself; and who writes to inform you, not to engross\r\nyour admiration. Had he given you a perfect history, and a flattering\r\npicture of himself, his work would have been a romance, and he an\r\nimpostor. He lived with a contempt of hypocrisy; and writes as he lived.\r\n\r\nGeorge the Second, contradicting the silly presages drawn from\r\nparallels, which had furnished opposition with names of unfortunate\r\nPrinces, who were the second of their name, as Edward, Richard,\r\nCharles, and James, terminated his career with glory both to himself\r\nand his people. He died, crowned with years and honours, and respected\r\nfrom success; which with the multitude is the same as being beloved. He\r\nleft a successor in the vigour of youth, ready to take the reins, and a\r\nministry universally applauded, united, and unembarrassed by opponents.\r\n\r\nNo British monarch had ascended the throne with so many advantages\r\nas George the Third. Being the first of his line born in England,\r\nthe prejudice against his family as foreigners ceased in his\r\nperson--Hanover was no longer the native soil of our Princes;\r\nconsequently, attachment to the Electorate was not likely to govern our\r\ncouncils, as it had done in the last two reigns. This circumstance,\r\ntoo, of his birth, shifted the unpopularity of foreign extraction from\r\nthe House of Brunswick to the Stuarts. In the flower and bloom of\r\nyouth, George had a handsome, open, and honest countenance; and with\r\nthe favour that attends the outward accomplishments of his age, he had\r\nnone of the vices that fall under the censure of those who are past\r\nenjoying them themselves.\r\n\r\nThe moment of his accession was fortunate beyond example. The\r\nextinction of parties had not waited for, but preceded the dawn of his\r\nreign. Thus it was not a race of factions running to offer themselves,\r\nas is common, to a new Prince, bidding for his favour, and ready each\r\nto be disgusted, if their antagonists were received with more grace;\r\nbut a natural devolution of duty from all men to the uncontroverted\r\nheir of the Crown, who had no occasion to court the love of his\r\nsubjects, nor could fear interrupting established harmony, but by\r\nmaking any change in a system so well compacted. The administration\r\nwas firm, in good harmony with one another, and headed by the most\r\nsuccessful genius that ever presided over our councils. Conquest had\r\ncrowned our arms with wonderful circumstances of glory and fortune; and\r\nthe young King seemed to have the option of extending our victories and\r\nacquisitions, or of giving peace to the world, by finding himself in a\r\nsituation so favourable, that neither his ambition nor moderation could\r\nhave been equitably reprehended. The designs and offences of France\r\nwould have justified a fuller measure of revenge; moderation could want\r\nno excuse.\r\n\r\nA passionate, domineering woman, and a Favourite, without talents, soon\r\ndrew a cloud over this shining prospect.\r\n\r\nWithout anticipating events too hastily, let it suffice to say, that\r\nthe measure of war was pushed, without even a desire that it should be\r\nsuccessful; and that, although successful, it was unnaturally checked\r\nby a peace, too precipitate, too indigested, and too shameful, to merit\r\nthe coldest eulogy of moderation.\r\n\r\nThe first moment of the new reign afforded a symptom of the Prince’s\r\ncharacter; of that cool dissimulation in which he had been so well\r\ninitiated by his mother, and which comprehended almost the whole of\r\nwhat she had taught him. Princess Amalie, as soon as she was certain\r\nof her father’s death, sent an account of it to the Prince of Wales;\r\nbut he had already been apprised of it. He was riding, and received\r\na note from a German valet-de-chambre, attendant on the late King,\r\nwith a private mark agreed upon between them, which certified him of\r\nthe event. Without surprise or emotion, without dropping a word that\r\nindicated what had happened, he said his horse was lame, and turned\r\nback to Kew. At dismounting he said to the groom, “I have said this\r\nhorse is lame; I forbid you to say the contrary.”\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt was the first who arrived at Kensington, and went to Princess\r\nAmalie for her orders. She told him nobody could give him better\r\ncounsel than his own. He asked if he ought not to go to the Prince? she\r\nreplied, she could not advise him; but thought it would be right. He\r\nwent. I mention these little circumstances, because they show from Mr.\r\nPitt’s uncertainty, that he was possessed with none of the confidence\r\nand ardour of a man who thinks himself a favourite.\r\n\r\nFrom Kew the new King went directly to Carleton House, which belonged\r\nto the Princess Dowager; ordering his servants and the Privy Council to\r\nwait for him at Saville House, then his own residence; and adjoining\r\nto Leicester House, where the Princess usually lived. The Duke of\r\nCumberland went to Leicester House, and waited two hours; but was\r\nsent for, as soon as the King knew it, to Carleton House, where he\r\ndetermined to stay, and avoid the parade and acclamation of passing\r\nthrough the streets: at the same time dismissing the guards, and\r\nordering them to attend the body of his grandfather.\r\n\r\nTo the Duke of Cumberland he marked great kindness, and told him it\r\nhad not been common in their family to live well together; but he\r\nwas determined to live well with all his family. And he carried this\r\nattention so far, as to take notice to the Duke after council, that\r\nhis friend Mr. Fox looked in great health. And again, when the Privy\r\nCouncil had made their address to his Majesty by the mouth of the\r\nArchbishop, it not being thought decent that the compliment on the\r\ndeath of his father should be uttered by the Duke, the King remarked\r\nit, and expressed an apprehension that they had put a slight upon his\r\nuncle. Nor would he suffer the name of his brother, the Duke of York,\r\nto be mentioned in the public prayers, because it must have taken place\r\nof that of the Duke of Cumberland.\r\n\r\nAt that first council the King spoke to nobody in particular but his\r\nformer governor, Lord Waldegrave. His speech to them he made with\r\ndignity and propriety. In whatever related to his predecessor, he\r\nbehaved with singular attention and decency, refusing at first to give\r\nthe word to the guard; and then only renewing what the late King had\r\ngiven. He sent to Princess Amalie to know where her father’s will was\r\ndeposited. She said, one copy had been entrusted to her eight or nine\r\nyears before; but thinking the King had forgotten it, she had lately\r\nput him in mind of it. He had replied, “Did not she know, that when\r\na new will was made, it cancelled all preceding?” No curiosity, no\r\neagerness, no haste was expressed by the new King on that head; nor the\r\nsmallest impediment thrown in the way of his grandfather’s intentions.\r\nA Gentleman[5] of the Bedchamber was immediately dismissed, who refused\r\nto sit up with the body, as is usual. Wilmot[6] and Ranby,[7] the late\r\nKing’s physician and surgeon, acquainted the King with two requests of\r\ntheir master, which were punctually complied with. They were, that his\r\nbody might be embalmed as soon as possible, and a double quantity of\r\nperfumes used; and that the side of the late Queen’s coffin, left loose\r\non purpose, might be taken away, and his body laid close to hers.\r\n\r\nIn his first council the King named his brother the Duke of York,\r\nand Lord Bute,[8] of the Cabinet. As no notice was taken of Lord\r\nHuntingdon, it indicated an uncertainty, whether he, who had been\r\nMaster of the Horse to the King when Prince, or Lord Gower, who had\r\nheld that office under the late King, should fill the post. To the\r\nSpeaker of the House of Commons the King said, it should not be his\r\nfault if that assembly did not go upon business earlier in the day than\r\nthey had done of late: a flattering speech to an old man attached to\r\nold forms.\r\n\r\nThe King’s speech to his council afforded matter of remark, and gave\r\nearly specimen of who was to be the confidential minister, and what\r\nmeasures were to be pursued: for it was drawn by Lord Bute, and\r\ncommunicated to none of the King’s servants. It talked _of a bloody\r\nand expensive war, and of obtaining an honourable and lasting peace_.\r\nThus was it delivered; but Mr. Pitt went to Lord Bute that evening, and\r\nafter an altercation of three hours, prevailed that in the printed copy\r\nthe words should be changed to _an expensive but just and necessary\r\nwar_; and that after the words _honourable peace_ should be inserted,\r\n_in concert with our allies_. Lord Mansfield and others counselled\r\nthese palliatives too; but it was two o’clock of the following\r\nafternoon before the King would yield to the alteration. Whether,\r\nthat the private Junto could not digest the correction, or whether to\r\ngive an idea of his Majesty’s firmness, I know not: but great pains\r\nwere taken to imprint an idea of the latter, as characteristic of\r\nthe new reign; and it was sedulously whispered by the creatures of\r\nthe Favourite and the mother, that it was the plan to retain all the\r\nlate King’s ministers, but that his Majesty would not be governed by\r\nthem, as his grandfather had been. In confirmation of part of this\r\nadvertisement, the King told the Duke of Newcastle and Mr. Pitt, that\r\nhe knew their attachment to the Crown, and should expect theirs, and\r\nthe assistance of all honest men.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt was too quicksighted not to perceive what would be the\r\ncomplexion of the new reign. His favourite war was already struck\r\nat. He himself had for some time been on the coldest terms with Lord\r\nBute; for possession of power, and reversion of power, could not\r\nfail to make two natures so haughty, incompatible. It was said, and\r\nI believe with truth, that an outset so unpromising to his darling\r\nmeasures, made Mr. Pitt propose to the Duke of Newcastle a firm union\r\nagainst the Favourite; but the Duke loved intrigues and new allies too\r\nwell to embrace it. And from that refusal has been dated Mr. Pitt’s\r\nanimosity to Newcastle; though the part the latter took more openly\r\nand more hostilely against him afterwards was sufficient cause for\r\nthat resentment. Whether these two men, so powerful in parliament and\r\nin the nation, could have balanced the headlong affection that attends\r\nevery new young Prince, is uncertain,--I think they could. A war so\r\ntriumphant had captivated the whole country. The Favourite was unknown,\r\nungracious, and a Scot: his connexion with the Princess, an object of\r\nscandal. He had no declared party; and what he had, was insignificant.\r\nNor would he probably have dared to stem such a body of force as would\r\nhave appeared against him. At least the union of Pitt and Newcastle\r\nwould have checked the torrent, which soon carried everything in favour\r\nof Prerogative. Newcastle’s time-serving undermined Mr. Pitt, was\r\ndestructive to himself, threw away all the advantages of the war, and\r\nbrought the country to the brink of ruin.\r\n\r\nYet this veteran, so busy, so selfish, and still so fond of power,\r\nfor a few days acted the part he ought to have adopted in earnest. He\r\nwaited on the King, pleaded his age, and begged to be excused from\r\nentering on a new reign. The King told him he could not part with him.\r\nFortified with this gracious and comfortable command, he next consulted\r\nhis friends. It was not their interest to point out to him the ridicule\r\nof thinking to rule in the Cabinet of a third George, almost a boy.\r\nFour days more determined the Duke to take a new court-lease of\r\nfolly.[9]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Devonshire,[10] though greatly younger, might not have\r\nbeen without difficulties too, if he had pleased to remember them. He\r\nhad been ill-treated in the late reign by the Prince and the Princess\r\nDowager, hated the Favourite, and had declared he would quit, whenever\r\nthe new reign should commence; but he thought better of it.\r\n\r\nThe Princess, whose ambition yielded to none, was desirous to figure in\r\nthe new era, and demanded to be declared _Princess-Mother_. Precedents\r\nwere searched for in vain; and she missed even this shadow of\r\ncompensation for the loss of the appellation of _Queen_--a loss which\r\nshe showed a little afterwards she could not digest.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Bute seemed to act with more moderation. His credit was\r\nmanifest; but he allotted himself no ministerial office, contenting\r\nhimself for the present with the post of Groom of the Stole, which\r\nhe had filled under the Prince, and for which room was prepared, by\r\nremoving the Earl of Rochford[11] with a large pension. Lord Bute’s\r\nagents gave out, that he would upon no account interfere or break with\r\nMr. Pitt. The latter, however, did not trust to these vague assurances,\r\nbut endeavoured to maintain the preceding system: talked to the King of\r\nthe Duke of Newcastle as first minister, and as wishing him to continue\r\nso; and said he had never chosen any other channel for his addresses or\r\ndemands to the late King--an intimation that he would make none through\r\nLord Bute. For himself, he had meddled with nothing but the war, and he\r\nwished his Majesty to give some mark that he approved the measures of\r\nthe late reign.\r\n\r\nThe other ministers were not less attentive to their own views. The\r\nDuke of Bedford[12] insisted on returning to the Government of Ireland,\r\nand that Lord Gower[13] should remain Master of the Horse; but the\r\nlatter point was accommodated by the removal of Sir Thomas Robinson\r\n(with a pension) from the Great Wardrobe, which was bestowed on Lord\r\nGower; and Lord Huntingdon continued in the post he had enjoyed under\r\nthe Prince. Mr. Mackenzie, the Favourite’s brother, was destined to\r\nbe Master of the Robes, but was forced to give way to the Duke of\r\nNewcastle, who obtained it for Mr. Brudenel;[14] for though bent on\r\nmaking his court, his Grace as often marred his own policy as promoted\r\nit.\r\n\r\nYet this seeming union of Pitt and Newcastle, on which the influence\r\nof the former in some measure depended, disgusted the City. They said,\r\nthat Mr. Pitt had temporized with Newcastle before from necessity, but\r\nnow it was matter of election. Yet by the intervention of Mr. Pitt’s\r\nagents, the City of London recommended to the King to be advised by\r\nhis grandfather’s ministers; and they even hinted at the loss the King\r\nof Prussia would suffer by the death of his uncle. Their attachment\r\nto their idol did not stop there. The first stone of the new bridge\r\nat Blackfriars was laid by the Lord Mayor a few days after the King’s\r\naccession, and on it was engraved so bombast an inscription in honour\r\nof Mr. Pitt, and drawn up in such bad Latin, that it furnished ample\r\nmatter of ridicule to his enemies.\r\n\r\nThe Favourite, though traversed in his views by the power of these two\r\npredominant men, had not patience to be wholly a cypher, but gave many\r\nlesser and indirect marks of his designs. A separate standard was to be\r\nerected. Lord George Sackville had leave to pay his duty to the King,\r\nand was well received; which gave such offence to Mr. Pitt, that Lord\r\nGeorge was privately instructed to discontinue his attendance. Lady\r\nMary Stuart,[15] daughter of the Favourite, and Lady Susan Stuart,[16]\r\ndaughter of the Earl of Galloway, a notorious and intemperate Jacobite,\r\nwere named of the Bedchamber to the Lady Augusta, the King’s eldest\r\nsister; and Sir Henry Erskine[17] was restored to his rank, and\r\ngratified with an old regiment. The Earl of Litchfield, Sir Walter\r\nBagot, and the principal Jacobites, went to Court, which George Selwyn,\r\na celebrated wit, accounted for, from the number of Stuarts that were\r\nnow at St. James’s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  Countenance shown to Tories.--Effect of Tory Politics on the\r\n    Nation.--Plan to carry the Prerogative to an unusual height.--\r\n    Unpopularity and Seclusion of the Princess of Wales.--Difficulty\r\n    of access to the King.--Manœuvres of his Mother.--Character of\r\n    Lord Bute, and his Schemes to conciliate the King.--Archbishop\r\n    Secker.--Character of George III.--Intended Duel between the\r\n    Earl of Albemarle and General Townshend.--Cause of the Quarrel.--\r\n    The King’s Speech.--Pitt and Beckford.--Increase of the Court\r\n    Establishment.--The Dukes of Richmond and Grafton.--Interview\r\n    between Lord Bute and the Duke of Richmond.--Advice to the latter\r\n    by the Duke of Cumberland.--The King’s Revenue.--The Princess\r\n    Dowager’s Passion for Money.--The Earl of Lichfield.--Viscount\r\n    Middleton.--Partiality to the Tories.--Inconsistency of the Duke\r\n    of Newcastle.--Irish Disputes.--The King of Prussia’s Victory\r\n    over Marshal Daun.--Mauduit’s Pamphlet on the German War.--Ways\r\n    and Means for the ensuing Year.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe countenance shown to the Tories, and to their citadel, the\r\nUniversity of Oxford, was at first supposed by those who stood at\r\ndistance from the penetralia, the measure of Mr. Pitt, as consonant to\r\nhis known desire of uniting, that was, breaking all parties. But the\r\nTories, who were qualified for nothing above a secret, could not keep\r\neven that. They came to Court, it is true; but they came with all their\r\nold prejudices. They abjured their ancient master, but retained their\r\nprinciples; and seemed to have exchanged nothing but their badge, _the\r\nWhite Rose_ for _the White Horse_. _Prerogative_ became a fashionable\r\nword; and the language of the times was altered, before the Favourite\r\ndared to make any variation in the Ministry.\r\n\r\nThese steps did not pass unnoticed: nor was the nation without\r\njealousy, even in the first dawn of the reign. Papers were stuck up\r\nat the Royal Exchange and in Westminster-hall, with these words, _no\r\nPetticoat Government, no Scotch Favourite_. An intemperance which\r\nproceeded so far afterwards, that, as the King passed in his chair to\r\nvisit his mother in an evening, the mob asked him if he was going to\r\nsuck? The Princess herself was obliged to discontinue frequenting the\r\ntheatres, so gross and insulting were the apostrophes with which she\r\nwas saluted from the galleries.\r\n\r\nThe views of the Court were so fully manifested afterwards, that no\r\ndoubt can be entertained but a plan had been early formed of carrying\r\nthe prerogative to very unusual heights. The Princess was ardently fond\r\nof power, and all its appanages of observance, rank and wealth. The\r\ndeepest secrecy and dissimulation guarded every avenue of her passions;\r\nand close retirement was adapted to these purposes. She could not\r\nappear in public (after the arrival of the Queen) as the first woman\r\nof the kingdom: her unpopularity made her pride tremble; and privacy\r\nshrouded such hours as were not calculated to draw esteem; and it\r\ncontracted her expenses. After the King’s marriage she appeared seldom\r\nor never at St. James’s, nor deigned to accompany the ceremony of the\r\ncoronation. The attendance of her ladies was dispensed with except\r\non drawing-room days; and by degrees even her maids of honour and\r\nwomen of the bedchamber were removed from her palace, where she lived\r\nin a solitude that would have passed for the perfection of Christian\r\nhumility in the ages of monkish ignorance. Jealousy of her credit over\r\nher son made her impose almost as strict laws of retirement on him. He\r\nwas accessible to none of his Court but at the stated hours of business\r\nand ceremony: nor was any man but the Favourite, and the creatures with\r\nwhom he had garrisoned the palace, allowed to converse with the King.\r\nAffection had no share in this management.\r\n\r\nThe Princess, who was never supposed to disclose her mind with\r\nfreedom,[18] but on the single topic of her own children, had often\r\nmentioned her eldest son with contempt; and during the life of her\r\nhusband, had given in to all his partiality for the Duke of York.\r\nWhen her views of governing by her husband were cut off, she applied\r\nto the untutored inexperience of his heir: and the first step towards\r\nthe influence she meditated, was by filling his mind with suspicions\r\nand ill impressions of all mankind. His uncle, the Duke of Cumberland,\r\nwas made another instrument. The young Prince had a great appetite:\r\nhe was asked if he wished to be as gross as his uncle? Every vice,\r\nevery condescension was imputed to the Duke, that the Prince might be\r\nstimulated to avoid them.\r\n\r\nThe Favourite, who had notions of honour, and was ostentatious,\r\nendeavoured to give a loftier cast to the disposition of his pupil,\r\nthough not to the disparagement of the vassalage in which he was to\r\nbe kept. Lord Bute had a little reading,[19] and affected learning.\r\nMen of genius, the arts and artists were to be countenanced. The arts\r\nmight amuse the young King’s solitary hours: authors might defend the\r\nmeasures of government, and were sure to pay for their pensions with\r\nincense, both to their passive and active protectors. The pedantry\r\nand artifice of these shallow views served but to produce ridicule.\r\nAugustus fell asleep over drawings and medals, which were pushed before\r\nhim every evening; and Mæcenas had so little knowledge, and so little\r\ntaste, that his own letters grew a proverb for want of orthography;\r\nand the scribblers he countenanced, were too destitute of talents to\r\nraise his character or their own. The coins of the King were the worst\r\nthat had appeared for above a century; and the revenues of the Crown\r\nwere so soon squandered in purchasing dependents, that architecture,\r\nthe darling art of Lord Bute, was contracted from the erection of\r\na new palace, to altering a single door-case in the drawing-room at\r\nSt. James’s. Yet, his emissaries the Scotch were indefatigable in\r\ncoining popular sayings and sentences for the King. It was given out\r\nthat he would suffer no money to be spent on elections. Circumstances\r\nthat recoiled with force, when every one of those aphorisms were\r\ncontradicted by practice.\r\n\r\nBut the chief engine to conciliate favour was the King’s piety. The\r\nPrincess, no doubt, intended it should be real, for she lived in dread\r\nof a mistress. But mankind was not inclined to think that her morals\r\ncould have imprinted much devotion on the mind of her son: nor was any\r\nman the dupe of those professions but Secker, the Archbishop, who for\r\nthe first days of the reign flattered himself with the idea of becoming\r\nfirst minister in a Court that hoisted the standard of religion. He\r\nwas unwearied in attendance at St. James’s,[20] and in presenting\r\nbodies of clergy; and his assiduity was so bustling and assuming, that\r\nhaving pushed aside the Duke of Cumberland to get at the King, his\r\nRoyal Highness reprimanded him with a bitter taunt. The prelate soon\r\ndiscovered his mistake. Nor were the Princess or the Favourite inclined\r\nto trust the King in the hands of a Churchman, whom they knew so well,\r\nand whose sanctity was as equivocal as their own.\r\n\r\nAs far as could be discerned of the King’s natural disposition, it was\r\nhumane and benevolent. If flowing courtesy to all men was the habit\r\nof his dissimulation, at least, it was so suited to his temper, that\r\nno gust of passion, no words of bitterness were ever known to break\r\nfrom him. He accepted services with grace and appearance of feeling:\r\nand if he forgot them with an unrestrained facility, yet he never\r\nmarked his displeasure with harshness. Silence served him to bear with\r\nunwelcome ministers, or to part with them. His childhood was tinctured\r\nwith obstinacy: it was adopted at the beginning of his reign, and\r\ncalled firmness; but did not prove to be his complexion. In truth, it\r\nwould be difficult to draw his character in positive colours. He had\r\nneither passions nor activity. He resigned himself obsequiously to the\r\ngovernment of his mother and Lord Bute: learned, and even entered with\r\nart into the lessons they inspired, but added nothing of his own. When\r\nthe task was done, he relapsed into indifference and indolence, till\r\nroused to the next day’s part.[21]\r\n\r\nThe first gust of faction that threatened the new era, was an\r\nintended duel between the Earl of Albemarle[22] and General George\r\nTownshend.[23] A pamphlet was published against the latter,[24]\r\nreflecting bitterly on the vanity with which he had assumed a principal\r\nshare in the conquest of Quebec, though the honour of signing the\r\ncapitulation had only fallen to him by the death of Wolfe and the\r\nwounds of Monckton; an honour so little merited, that he had done his\r\nutmost to traverse Wolfe’s plans. The pamphlet, too, set forth the\r\njustice of taking such freedom with a man whose ill-nature had seized\r\nevery opportunity of ridiculing those he disliked by exhibiting their\r\npersonal defects in caricatures, which he had been the first to apply\r\nto politics. His uncle the Duke of Newcastle, the Duke of Cumberland,\r\nand Mr. Fox, had been the chief objects of those buffoon satires. The\r\npamphlet was certainly written under the direction of the last, and\r\ncould not fail to be agreeable to the partizans of the second. It\r\nwounded so deeply, that Townshend, in the first blindness of his rage,\r\nconcluded it came from the person he hated most and had most offended:\r\nthat was the Duke of Cumberland: and as Lord Albemarle was the first\r\nfavourite of his Royal Highness, thither Townshend addressed his\r\nresentment, though no man was less an author than the Earl. A challenge\r\npassed, was accepted, and prevented in time by Townshend’s want of\r\ncaution.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of November the Parliament met. Many Tories, though they\r\nhad received no formal invitation, appeared at the Cockpit to hear the\r\nKing’s speech read. It was composed, as usual, by Lord Hardwicke, was\r\nlong and dull, and had received additions from Pitt. On the Address\r\nBeckford proposed to push the war with more vigour, the end of the last\r\ncampaign having, he said, been languid. Pitt fired at this reproach\r\nfrom his friend, though certainly not levelled at him, and asked\r\nBeckford what new species of extravagance he wished for? The Address\r\nfrom Oxford had other objects in view. They boasted openly of their\r\nattachment to Monarchy. As all places were already filled with Whigs,\r\nthe Court was forced to increase the establishment, in order to admit\r\ntheir devotees. The King’s Bedchamber received six or eight additional\r\nGrooms and seven Gentlemen. Most of the late King’s were continued; the\r\nKing’s own were joined with them; the rest were taken from the Tories.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Richmond,[25] haughty and young, was offended that his\r\ncousin, Colonel Keppel,[26] was removed from Gentleman of the Horse,\r\nwhich the King destined for one of his own servants. The Duke asked\r\nan audience; but began it with objecting to the distinction paid to\r\nSir Henry Erskine.[27] This so much disgusted, that the King would not\r\nhear the Duke on the subject of Keppel. On cooler thoughts, Lord Bute\r\nwas sent to the Duke, to offer him to be of the King’s Bedchamber.\r\nHe accepted it, on condition that Keppel should remain Gentleman of\r\nthe Horse, which was likewise granted. But this pacification lasted\r\nfew days. Lord Fitzmaurice,[28] a favourite of Lord Bute, was made\r\nEquerry to the King; though inferior in military rank to Lord George\r\nLenox[29] and Charles Fitzroy,[30] brothers of the Dukes of Richmond\r\nand Grafton. The latter[31] had been of the Bedchamber to the King,\r\nwhen Prince, but had quitted it, from dislike of Court attendance, and\r\ndisgusted with the haughty stateliness affected by Lord Bute. Richmond\r\nand Grafton were much of an age; each regarded himself as Prince of\r\nthe Blood; and emulation soon created a sort of rivalship between\r\nthem. The Duke of Richmond’s figure was noble, and his countenance\r\nsingularly handsome. The Duke of Grafton was low, but manly, and with\r\nmuch grace in his address. The passions of both were strong, but of the\r\nfirst, ardent; of the latter, slow and inflexible. His temper was not\r\nhappy; but the Duke of Richmond’s, which was thought worse, because\r\nmore impetuous, was pliant, and uncommonly easy and accommodating\r\nin his family and society. Both were thought avaricious; but the\r\nlatter very unjustly, generally approaching nearer to the opposite\r\nextreme of profusion. His parts, too, were quicker and more subtle\r\nthan Grafton’s and more capable of application, though his elocution\r\nwas much inferior. The Duke of Grafton had a grace and dignity in his\r\nutterance that commanded attention, and dazzled in lieu of matter; and\r\nhis temper being shy and reserved, he was supposed to be endued with\r\nmore steadiness than his subsequent conduct displayed. Neither of them\r\nwanted obstinacy; but their obstinacy not flowing from system, it was\r\nin both a torrent more impetuous in its course than in its duration.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Grafton made a decent representation to the King, on the\r\nwrong done to his brother, and demanded rank for him. The other Duke\r\ncarried a violent memorial, and commented on it in a manner, which some\r\nyears afterwards he found had never been forgotten or forgiven. The\r\nnext day he resigned the Bedchamber, but not his regiment. In a few\r\ndays he repented this step, and went to Lord Bute to explain away his\r\nresignation, which, he said, might not be known. Lord Bute replied,\r\nall the world knew it. The Duke, thinking this coldness proceeded from\r\na suspicion that he was influenced by Fox,[32] his brother-in-law,\r\ndisclaimed all connexion with him, and said, he had never approved\r\nhis sister’s marriage. Lord Bute, who even then probably had views of\r\nFox’s support, as a counterbalance to Pitt, replied, that Mr. Fox’s\r\nalliance could be a disgrace to no man; as he must always be of great\r\nuse and weight in this country. Yet the Duke’s youth and frankness\r\nmade him avow what he had said to Fox himself, in the presence of Lord\r\nAlbemarle, who, though not much older, had far more worldly cunning,\r\nand no doubt reported the conversation to his master, the Duke of\r\nCumberland; for Richmond and Albemarle, though first cousins, were no\r\nfriends; and the latter possessed all the arts of a Court. The Duke,\r\nrebuffed by the Favourite, next consulted the Duke of Cumberland,\r\nwho told him prudently, that he was sorry the Duke of Richmond, at\r\ntwenty-three, had quarrelled with the King, at twenty-two; and advised\r\nhim to retire into the country, which he did. The effects of these\r\nsquabbles will appear hereafter, which made it proper to state them\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nThe King’s revenue was settled and fixed to eight hundred thousand\r\npounds a year, certain. In the late reign any overplus was to accrue\r\nto the Crown, but had ever produced so trifling an augmentation, that\r\nthe present boasted restriction, which was often quoted as one great\r\nmerit of the new Government, was not worth mentioning. It is true,\r\nthis revenue was by no means ample, considering the large incumbrances\r\nwith which it was loaded. The Duke of Cumberland’s annuity (exclusive\r\nof the parliamentary grant of twenty-five thousand pounds a year) was\r\nfifteen thousand pounds; Princess Amalie’s, twelve thousand. The King’s\r\nbrothers were to be provided for out of it; so was a future Queen; and\r\nthe Princess Dowager’s jointure was of fifty thousand pounds a year\r\nfrom the same fund. Yet, though her dower was so great--though she\r\nreduced her family, and lived in a privacy that exceeded economy, and\r\nthough she had a third of the Dutchy of Cornwall, which produced four\r\nthousand pounds a year more, her passion for money was so great, that\r\nshe obtained an additional annuity of ten thousand pounds a year from\r\nher son.[33] The Electorate suffered for these exigences of the Crown.\r\nWhatever money could be drawn from thence was sunk in the privy purse,\r\nwhich was entirely under the direction of Lord Bute.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Litchfield,[34] a leader of the Tories, was added to the\r\nKing’s Bedchamber, as the Earl of Oxford[35] and Lord Bruce[36] had\r\nbeen before, with the Scotch Earls of March[37] and Eglinton.[38] The\r\nLord Viscount Middleton,[39] an Irish Peer, was the first who in the\r\nHouse of Commons here broached a hint of jealousy against the channel\r\nin which Court favour seemed to flow. He was ridiculed for it by\r\nCharles Townshend; but the spirit of dissatisfaction had been infused\r\ninto the former by the Duke of Newcastle, who openly censured the\r\nnew partiality to the Tories. Partiality there was, but the grievance\r\ncame with an ill grace from Newcastle, Stone,[40] suspected for more\r\nthan a Tory, had been placed by him as preceptor to the King; Lord\r\nMansfield had been his bosom favourite; and to gratify that favourite,\r\nthe extension of the _Habeas Corpus_ had been prevented. To gain the\r\nTories had been a prudent measure, but their principles were still more\r\nwelcome to the Court than their votes. Having only votes to offer, and\r\nneither numbers nor abilities, they brought much discredit on their\r\npatron, and little strength to his assistance.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland the prospect was not more promising. By Poyning’s law the\r\nPrivy Council of Ireland are to transmit hither all heads of bills,\r\nparticularly of money-bills. This latter was omitted by the intrigues\r\nof the Primate, courting popularity. The bills were sent back, with\r\na severe reprimand for the omission of a money-bill. Mr. Pitt alone\r\ntook up the defence of the Irish Commons, and would not sign the\r\nmessage, which thirty-four others of the English Privy Council who were\r\npresent signed. The King thanked the Duke of Bedford for supporting\r\nhis prerogative, but the Privy Council of Ireland wrote angry letters\r\nto the Duke and his minister Rigby, telling them that they must not\r\ncome into that Kingdom again. The Duke, a little before, had been\r\nchallenged even in print by a mad Lord Clanrickard,[41] whose letter\r\nbeing complained of by his Grace, the Council here ordered the\r\nAttorney-General to prosecute the Earl: Rigby,[42] too, sent him a\r\nchallenge, which he did not accept. The Lords Justices sent over a\r\nstrong remonstrance in vindication of their conduct, and there the\r\nmatter ended for the present; but in the beginning of the next year\r\nthe Lords Justices renewed the attack on their Governor, and he and\r\nRigby were burned in effigy. Mr. Pitt interposed, and prevailed to\r\nhave a temperate memorial sent to the Justices, arguing the point with\r\nthem, and to _that_ he offered _to set his little name_, which was\r\ndone. The Lords Justices submitted, but with threats from the Primate\r\nof resigning his part of the government. Nor yet did they send a new\r\nbill, but a plan for raising the money already voted. Lord Clanrickard,\r\nin answer to Rigby’s challenge, which had been printed and dispersed\r\nin Ireland, replied in print likewise, excusing his not appearing at\r\nHolyhead, the appointed rendezvous, on account of the prosecution\r\ndirected against him, though the prosecution in date was subsequent to\r\nthe challenge by two months. The Earl affirmed that he had proposed to\r\nMr. Rigby a new place of meeting; but a year or two afterwards, on an\r\naccidental journey of Rigby to Ireland, the Earl seemed very glad that\r\nan interposition was made, and the quarrel accommodated. The ill-humour\r\nof the country, however, determined the Duke of Bedford to quit the\r\nGovernment, after having amply gratified his family and dependents with\r\npensions. The Earl of Kildare, for taking no part in these divisions,\r\nwas rewarded with a marquisate.\r\n\r\nForeign affairs fluctuated with their old vicissitude. The Russians\r\nand Austrians made themselves masters of Berlin, and treated it with\r\nmore lenity than could be expected from such barbarians and incensed\r\nenemies. But they relinquished it in a few days; and before the close\r\nof the year the King’s fortune and arms recovered their lustre by a\r\nsignal victory, which he gained in person near Torgau, over his great\r\ncompetitor in glory, Marshal Daun, who was wounded in the thigh, and\r\ncarried from the field; a circumstance that did not impeach his fame,\r\nas the loss of the day was attributed to his absence.\r\n\r\nYet this victory, shining as it was, could not counterbalance the new\r\nspirit that was gone forth in England to the disparagement of the\r\nwar. Lord Hardwicke had long distasted it; and under his countenance\r\nhad been published a Tract, setting forth the burthen and ill-policy\r\nof our German measures. It was called _Considerations on the German\r\nWar_; was shrewdly and ably written, and had more operation in working\r\na change on the minds of men, than perhaps ever fell to the lot of\r\na pamphlet.[43] The author was one Mauduit, formerly a Dissenting\r\nteacher, and at that time a factor at Blackwell-hall. How agreeable his\r\npolitics were to the interior of the Court, soon appeared by a place\r\nbeing bestowed on him by Lord Bute. Still, however, the Favourite left\r\nthe contest to be managed by other hands; and he had acted wisely to\r\nhave adhered to that plan. A new and formidable expedition had been\r\npreparing. Newcastle and Hardwicke had quitted the Council, because\r\nthey could not prevail to have it laid aside. Yet it was postponed for\r\nsome time. Pitt, in the House of Commons, taking notice of the pacific\r\nspirit that he saw arising, said, “Some are for keeping Canada; some,\r\nGuadaloupe; who will tell me which I shall be hanged for not keeping?”\r\n\r\nOn opening the ways and means for the ensuing year, George Grenville\r\nopposed the intended tax on ale and beer; the first overt act of his\r\ndisagreement with Mr. Pitt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  New Promotions.--Pitt and Grenville.--Aggrandizement of Lord\r\n    Bute.--His haughtiness.--Sir Henry Erskine, Home, and Worseley.--\r\n    Debt to the Chancery of Hanover.--Secret Article in the Treaty\r\n    with the Landgrave of Hesse.--Extravagance of the War.--New\r\n    Tenure of the Judges.--Approaching general Election.--Flagrant\r\n    Corruption.--Lord Bute appears more ostensibly in the character\r\n    of Minister.--Mr. Pitt and Lord Holderness.--Injudicious Conduct\r\n    of Lord Bute.--Ministerial Changes.--A strange Exaltation.--The\r\n    Duke of Rutland.--Mr. Legge and the King.--General Conway.--\r\n    Overtures by France for Peace.\r\n\r\nThe new year opened with promotions. The Lord Keeper Henley was made\r\nLord Chancellor. Lord Denbigh,[44] a creature of the Favourite, Master\r\nof the Harriers; and George Grenville[45] was called to the Cabinet\r\nCouncil. Pitt had ever treated him with contempt, and little expected\r\nto find him vain or daring enough to enter the lists against him.\r\nGrenville’s conceit of himself was by no means measured by the standard\r\nof modesty. His ambition was equal to Pitt’s; and his plodding,\r\nmethodic genius made him take the spirit of detail for ability.\r\nAvarice, which he possessed in no less proportion than his other\r\npassions, concurred to lead him from a master, who browbeat and treated\r\nhim superciliously, to worship the rising sun. Lord Bute was in want of\r\ntools; and it was a double prize to acquire them from his rival’s shop.\r\n\r\nBut Fortune, had he known how to use her gifts, was kinder to the\r\nFavourite than his own politics. His wife’s father, old Wortley\r\nMontagu, died at this time, and left to her and her second son a\r\nfortune, that, at four per cent., was estimated at one million three\r\nhundred and forty thousand pounds. This was the third death within\r\ntwelve months that happened to aggrandize Lord Bute. The decease of\r\nhis uncle, the Duke of Argyle,[46] left Scotland open to his power;\r\nand that of the late King put the Crown itself into his hands. The\r\nestate of his father-in-law was all he was qualified to enjoy. What\r\ncould be expected from a boy[47] locked up from the converse of\r\nmankind, governed by a mother still more retired, who was under the\r\ninfluence of a man that had passed his life in solitude, and was too\r\nhaughty to admit to his familiarity but half a dozen silly authors\r\nand flatterers? Sir Henry Erskine,[48] a military poet, Home,[49] a\r\ntragedy-writing parson, and Worseley,[50] a rider of the great horse\r\nand architect, were his principal confidents. The nation was soon\r\ngoverned accordingly. And yet it was not the nation’s fault, if it did\r\nnot receive the yoke even from this Junto!\r\n\r\nNo trouble was given to the Government by the old Parliament, which\r\nstill subsisted, and continued to lend all facilities to the progress\r\nof the war. An estimate of three hundred thousand pounds due to the\r\nChancery of Hanover, for forage for the use of Hanoverians, Prussians,\r\nand Hessians, was voted to be paid, without a division, though not\r\nwithout some comments. Sir Francis Dashwood, Cooke,[51] Coventry,[52]\r\nand Beckford[53] opposed it. Coventry said with a sneer, he was glad so\r\n_just_ a debt was demanded before the nation was bankrupt, and unable\r\nto discharge it. Beckford imputed the extravagance of the war (which\r\nindeed was notorious) to the Duke of Newcastle, who, he supposed,\r\nintended to overturn Mr. Pitt’s system, and prevent the continuation of\r\nthe war, by the excess of the expense; and he commended the management\r\nof the Treasury during the short time in which it had been in the\r\nDuke of Devonshire’s hands. Legge[54] defended the measure, and both\r\nNewcastle’s and Devonshire’s administrations. Pitt was confined with\r\nthe gout, and not present.\r\n\r\nIn the last treaty with the Landgrave of Hesse, had been stipulated\r\na secret article of indemnification to that country. Many sums had\r\nbeen allowed to them, to avoid the appearance in public of the article\r\nitself. Mr. Pitt had at once granted them sixty thousand pounds on\r\nthat score. Yet now at last was Administration forced to lay before\r\nParliament a demand of four hundred thousand pounds for indemnification\r\nto the Landgravate. Legge, who knew himself fallen into disgrace\r\nwith Lord Bute, refused to make the motion, on which he received\r\nintimation that he must resign. Lord Winchelsea[55] said, Legge had had\r\nmore masters than any man in England, and had never left one with a\r\ncharacter. Lord Barrington,[56] therefore, made the demand. Beckford\r\nagain declaimed on the extravagance of the war. Sir Francis Dashwood\r\nsaid, he had always disapproved the continental war, but would agree\r\nto vote the money, (which was a sum of two hundred and sixty thousand\r\npounds for three years,) as we were bound by treaty to pay it; and he\r\nfound fault with more authorities not being laid before Parliament.\r\nThis money too was granted on March 6.\r\n\r\nThree days before, the King had gone to Parliament, to desire that the\r\nplaces of the judges, which were held during the life of the Prince on\r\nthe Throne, might be fixed to them for their own lives. This was one of\r\nLord Bute’s strokes of pedantry. The tenure of the judges had formerly\r\nbeen a popular topic; and had been secured as far as was necessary.\r\nHe thought this trifling addition would be popular now, when nobody\r\nthought or cared about it. When, not long afterwards, the advocates\r\nfor the Court were puzzled to produce instances of favour to the\r\nconstitution or to the cause of liberty, this boon to the judges was\r\nsounded high, and repeated in every panegyric.\r\n\r\nNothing more of note occurred in this session. All attention was\r\nengrossed by the approaching general election of a new Parliament. It\r\nhad been propagated that the King had forbidden any money to be issued\r\nfrom the Treasury. Nothing was less true in fact, or proved less true\r\nin effect. Both the Court and particulars went greater lengths than in\r\nany preceding times. In truth, the corruption of electors met, if not\r\nexceeded, that of candidates. The borough of Sudbury was so shameless,\r\nas to advertise itself to the highest bidder.\r\n\r\nBut, preparatory to a new Parliament, and as an intimation to men\r\nunder whom they should list, the Favourite determined to appear more\r\nostensibly in the character of Minister. Accordingly, on the 12th of\r\nMarch, orders were suddenly sent to Lord Holderness to give up the\r\nseals of Secretary of State: the King adding, in discourse, that he\r\nhad two secretaries, one (Mr. Pitt) who would do nothing, and the\r\nother (Lord Holderness) who could do nothing;[57] he would have one,\r\nwho both could and would. This was Lord Bute, to whom the Seals were\r\nimmediately delivered. Subduing Europe was reckoned nothing, as the\r\nservice was ungracious: and however low the talents of Lord Holderness\r\ndeserved to be estimated, they did not suffer by comparison with those\r\nof his successor. Mr. Pitt resented the fall of his creature, but was\r\nsweetened by the offer of cofferer to James Grenville.[58] Newcastle\r\nrejoiced, having been deserted by Holderness; but affected to be\r\nconcerned: yet was not struck with the warning that this measure ought\r\nto have been to himself. Mr. Pitt felt it more sensibly, and would not\r\npart with Lord Temple, who might have been Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,\r\nbut was necessary to him in the House of Lords, where his measures had\r\nno other champion. Lord Halifax was named to that great office; the\r\nDuke of Bedford refused to accept any post; but it was supposed had his\r\neye on the Seals, which everybody expected disgust would soon oblige\r\nMr. Pitt to resign.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more injudicious than this step taken by the\r\nFavourite. The conduct he ought to have pursued was obvious; which\r\nwas, lying quiet, till some or all of a few events, most probable to\r\nhappen, should have paved the way to his taking the reins. Newcastle\r\nwas old, Mr. Pitt very infirm. Their deaths, or at least a rupture\r\nbetween them, would have delivered him from them; at least have\r\nconstituted him umpire between them. Any sinister event of the war\r\nmight have demolished Mr. Pitt’s popularity. Prudence, at least, should\r\nhave dictated to Lord Bute to await the conclusion of the peace,\r\nwhich, however good, would have given a shock to Mr. Pitt’s credit,\r\nfrom the impossibility of contenting all mankind. But the Favourite\r\nwas as impatient to have the honour of making that peace, as if he\r\nhad intended to make it an honourable one. His thrusting himself into\r\nadministration at the moment he did, was so preposterous, that most men\r\nthought him betrayed into it by malicious advice. The Duke of Bedford,\r\nto pay his court, and from desire of peace, certainly counselled it;\r\nbut Newcastle, and Hardwicke too, were generally believed to have\r\ninfused the same advice, with a view to his destruction; for while only\r\nGroom of the Stole, Lord Bute stood in no responsible place. This was\r\nthe more likely, as what emoluments they obtained for their friends in\r\nthe new shuffling of the cards, by no means compensated for the credit\r\nthey lost by the appearance of this new star in the horizon of power.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Rutland[59] was named Groom of the Stole; Lord Sandys,[60]\r\nFirst Lord of Trade, but upon the ancient footing; the West Indies, to\r\nplease Mr. Pitt, being again put under the province of the Secretary\r\nof State. The Duke of Leeds[61] was turned back to his old place of\r\nJustice in Eyre, in the room of Lord Sandys, but with an additional\r\nsalary of a thousand pounds a year. Legge, who refused to resign, was\r\ndismissed; and Lord Barrington made Chancellor of the Exchequer; being\r\nsucceeded by Charles Townshend[62] as Secretary at War. Sir Francis\r\nDashwood was made Treasurer of the Chambers. Elliot,[63] another of\r\nLord Bute’s court, succeeded James Grenville at the Board of Treasury.\r\nLord Villiers[64] and Thomas Pelham[65] were placed in the Admiralty,\r\nas John Yorke, Lord Hardwicke’s fourth son, Rice,[66] son-in-law of\r\nLord Talbot, and Sir Edmund Thomas were at the Board of Trade. Mr.\r\nSpencer[67] and Sir Richard Grosvenor (at the recommendation of Mr.\r\nPitt) were created Viscounts; Sir Thomas Robinson,[68] Sir Nathaniel\r\nCurzon,[69] a rich Tory, Sir William Irby,[70] chamberlain to the\r\nPrincess, were made barons, along with Dodington,[71] whose ambition\r\nstill hovered about the Court, in which he was at last likely to have\r\nsome lead, by his connexion with the Favourite. Nor did Lord Bath[72]\r\nhimself quit sight of the back-stairs, by which he obtained leave to\r\nhobble up to the King whenever he pleased.\r\n\r\nBut a phenomenon, that for some time occasioned more speculation\r\nthan even the credit of the Favourite, was the staff of Lord Steward\r\nbeing put into the hands of Lord Talbot,[73] with the addition of an\r\nearldom. As neither gravity, rank, interest, abilities, nor morals\r\ncould be adduced to countenance this strange exaltation, no wonder it\r\ncaused very unfavourable comments. This Lord had long affected a very\r\nfree-spoken kind of patriotism on all occasions. He had some wit, and\r\na little tincture of a disordered understanding; but was better known\r\nas a boxer and man of pleasure, than in the light of a statesman.\r\nThe Duchess of ---- had been publicly divorced from her lord on his\r\naccount; and was not the only woman of fashion who had lived with him\r\nopenly as his mistress. He was strong, well made, and very comely;\r\nbut with no air, nor with the manners of a man of quality. No wonder\r\nthe promotion of such a minister, in a reign that advertised piety,\r\nstrengthened the suspicions already entertained of the sincerity of\r\nthe Court. It grew more comic still, when the new statesman appeared\r\nto be a reformer too. As the Court knew that the measures it had in\r\ncontemplation could only be carried by money, every stratagem was\r\ninvented to curtail the common expenses of the Palace. As these fell\r\nunder the province of the Lord Steward, nothing was heard of but cooks\r\ncashiered, and kitchens shut up. Even the Maids of Honour, who did\r\nnot expect rigours from a great officer of Lord Talbot’s complexion,\r\nwere reduced to complain of the abridgement of their allowance for\r\nbreakfast. The public joined in the cry, and the shops teemed with\r\nscandalous prints against the reformer and his patroness.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Rutland was not pleased with the office of Groom of the\r\nStole, which had fewer employments in its disposal, and which was\r\ntherefore given to Lord Holderness; but the very next day the Duke was\r\nappointed Master of the Horse, from whence Lord Huntingdon[74] was\r\nremoved to be Groom of the Stole; and Lord Holderness was laid aside\r\nwith a large pension, and the reversion of the Cinque Ports after the\r\nDuke of Dorset. Lady Bute was created a baroness, that her son might\r\ninherit an English peerage.\r\n\r\nWhen Legge resigned his Seal, he lamented being under his Majesty’s\r\ndispleasure, but said his future life should testify his zeal. The\r\nKing replied, he was glad to hear him say so; nothing but his future\r\nlife could eradicate the ill impressions he had received of him. His\r\ndisgrace was owing to his not having seconded the Favourite’s views in\r\nthe late reign, when Lord Bute had been desirous of bringing a Jacobite\r\nfriend into Parliament for Hampshire, of which more will be said\r\nhereafter.[75]\r\n\r\nGeneral Conway[76] was sent to command in Germany under Lord Granby.\r\nThe Bedford faction opposed it, in favour of General Waldegrave,[77]\r\nwho had served there during the whole war, upon the supposition that\r\nLord Granby would come to England, and that Waldegrave might succeed\r\nhim, Mostyn[78] not being equal to the charge. Conway obtained to\r\nbe sent, but without a certain promise of replacing Lord Granby,[79]\r\nthough the King said Conway was a man of abilities, character, sense,\r\nand prudence, such as was greatly wanted there. France at this time\r\nmade earnest overtures for peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  Thanks of the House of Commons to Mr. Onslow, their Speaker.--\r\n    His Character.--Sir John Philipps.--Mr. Legge.--Mr. More, of\r\n    Shrewsbury.--Mr. Onslow’s retirement.--His last address to the\r\n    House.--Lord Bath’s Pamphlet.--Solicitations by France for\r\n    Peace.--Mr. Pitt disinclined to negotiate.--Expedition against\r\n    Belleisle.--Mr. Pitt’s obstinacy.--Lord Bute’s Faction.--Mr.\r\n    Pitt and the Duke of Bedford.--Negotiation for Peace.--Monsieur\r\n    de Bussy.--Mr. Stanley.--Death of Archibald Duke of Argyle,\r\n    and of Hoadley, Bishop of Winchester.--Character of those\r\n    Personages.--Their Successors.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last day of the session, March 18th, was fixed for returning the\r\nthanks of the House of Commons to Mr. Onslow, their Speaker, who had\r\nfilled the chair with unblemished integrity during the whole long reign\r\nof George the Second, and who had the prudence to quit the scene before\r\nhis years and growing infirmities made him a burthen to himself and the\r\npublic.[80] No man had ever supported with more firmness the privileges\r\nof the House, nor sustained the dignity of his office with more\r\nauthority. His knowledge of the Constitution equalled his attachment to\r\nit. To the Crown he behaved with all the decorum of respect, without\r\nsacrificing his freedom of speech. Against encroachments of the House\r\nof Peers he was an inflexible champion. His disinterested virtue\r\nsupported him through all his pretensions; and though to conciliate\r\npopular favour he affected an impartiality that by turns led him to the\r\nborders of insincerity and contradiction--and though he was so minutely\r\nattached to forms, that it often made him troublesome in affairs of\r\nhigher moment, it will be difficult to find a subject whom gravity will\r\nso well become, whose knowledge will be so useful and so accurate, and\r\nwhose fidelity to his trust will prove so unshaken.\r\n\r\nSir John Philipps[81] moved the address of thanks to him for his great\r\nservices, but so wretchedly, that the sensibility the House showed on\r\nthe occasion flowed only from their hearts, not from any impression\r\nmade on them by the eloquence of their spokesman. Legge seconded the\r\nmotion with his usual propriety and brevity, and _commended retreat_,\r\nGod knows with what sincerity! Others threw in their word of panegyric;\r\nand Mr. More, of Shrewsbury, an old and acute member, proposed to erect\r\na statue to the Speaker’s memory, with great encomiums on the authority\r\nwith which he had formerly kept in order such men as then filled the\r\nTreasury-bench and composed the Opposition, naming among the former Sir\r\nRobert Walpole and Mr. Pelham, the latter of whom, he said, had the\r\nhonour of dying a Commoner. More was a Whig of the primitive stamp,\r\nand though attached to Sir Robert Walpole, had withstood, and by the\r\nforce of his honest abilities had defeated, the intended clemency of\r\nthat Minister to some attainted Jacobite families with respect to their\r\nestates. He had long abstained from Parliament, returned to it without\r\nhis former success, and now appeared there for the last time.\r\n\r\nHenry Archer[82] proposed to address the Crown to bestow a pecuniary\r\nreward on the Speaker’s services. Sir John Philipps replied, he knew\r\nthat was intended; as it was; an annuity of two thousand pounds a\r\nyear to him and his son. Sir George Saville approved the reward, but\r\ndesired the Commons, not the Crown, might have the merit of bestowing\r\nit. Velters Cornwall made one of his absurd, ill-natured speeches,\r\nwhich the House was always so kind as to take for humour, teazing\r\nthe Speaker under pretence of complimenting him; while the good old\r\nman sat overpowered with gratitude, and weeping over the testimonies\r\nborne to his virtue. He rose at last, and closed his public life in\r\nthe most becoming manner; neither over-acting modesty, nor checking\r\nthe tender sensibility which he necessarily felt at quitting the\r\ndarling occupation of his life. His thanks to the House for their\r\npatient sufferance of his errors, and for their gracious acceptance of\r\nhis endeavours to serve them, were shortly, but cogently, expressed;\r\nand his voice, and the tears he could not restrain, spoke still more\r\nforcibly how much his soul was agitated by laudable emotions. He\r\nbegged to have the address spared, as he would accept nothing for\r\nhimself, though he would not prejudice his family. He was going, he\r\nsaid, into the most close and obscure retreat, where he should want\r\nlittle; and he concluded with a pathetic prayer for the perpetuity\r\nof the Constitution. Sir John Philipps desired that what he had\r\nuttered might be inserted in the votes. The Speaker protested he\r\ncould not remember his own words, but the House insisted, as Cornwall\r\nand Sir George Saville did on the address, to which the Speaker at\r\nlast acquiesced, and it was voted. He ended with saying this was the\r\ngreatest day and the greatest honours ever known, for they could only\r\nbe conferred by a free nation.[83]\r\n\r\nThe next day the Parliament was prorogued, then dissolved, and a new\r\none chosen.\r\n\r\nIn this month was published a pamphlet called “Seasonable Hints from\r\nan Honest Man on the present Crisis.” The author, and some of the\r\ndoctrines it broached--not any merit in the composition--make it\r\nmemorable. It was written by Lord Bath,[84] who having surprised the\r\nKing into a promise of the Lord-Lieutenancy of Shropshire, was opposed\r\nby the Duke of Newcastle, who supported Lord Powis.[85] The pamphlet,\r\ntherefore, warmly attacked his Grace, taxed him with his cabals\r\nand resignation in the last rebellion, and it defended the measure\r\nof admitting the Tories to a participation of power. In general,\r\nthe language of the pamphlet was that of the Court, who conducted\r\nthemselves by the advice bequeathed by Lord Bolingbroke, who had, and\r\nwith truth, assured the late Prince of Wales, that the Tories would\r\nbe the heartiest in the support of prerogative. The censure passed on\r\npensions was not equally flattering to the Court, the new reign having\r\nalready bestowed them profusely. Yet much the book vaunted the King’s\r\ndeclaration against corruption in elections, which had gone no farther\r\nthan to undermine the Duke of Newcastle’s influence. The private Junto\r\nwas impatient to conclude the peace, that they might prosecute the\r\nintended war on the old ministry at home, the established harmony\r\nbeing solely produced by the war, as had often been the case at Rome.\r\nA few pedantic examples were the sum of Lord Bute’s knowledge; yet his\r\npartizans affected to celebrate the care he had taken of the King’s\r\neducation. A well-founded panegyric on a man who was deficient in the\r\northography of his own language! The King had had able preceptors: the\r\nBishop of Norwich[86] was a scholar; the Bishop of Salisbury[87] not\r\ndeficient. Stone and Scott had taste and knowledge. Lord Waldegrave,\r\nfor forming a King, was not to be matched. It proved, indeed, that his\r\nMajesty had learned nothing, but what a man, who knew nothing, could\r\nteach him.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of March, France renewed the most pressing solicitations\r\nfor peace. They frankly avowed the distress of their affairs; for\r\nthey did not apprehend hard-heartedness in the new Court. Augsburgh\r\nthey proposed for the place of congress, or any other town the King\r\nshould name, professing they would treat _vis-à-vis du Roi de la Grande\r\nBrétagne_; for which purpose they offered to send a minister hither,\r\nwhere, too, might be one from the King of Prussia: the ministers of\r\n_their_ allies should assemble at Paris. The two Empresses, they said,\r\nwere grown more moderate in their demands; and for their own part, they\r\ntalked of yielding to us all Canada. So much ear was given to these\r\novertures, that the Earl of Egremont[88] and Sir Joseph Yorke[89] were\r\nnamed to go to the Congress. But so little was this measure to the\r\ninclination of Mr. Pitt, that he prosecuted with unusual warmth an\r\nexpedition he had meditated against Belleisle; a conquest of so little\r\nvalue, and so inadequate to the expense with which it was attended,\r\nthat the plan was by many believed calculated solely to provoke the\r\nCourt of France, and break off the negotiation. France was more\r\nsurprised than concerned at this attack. Sir Edward Hawke had lain\r\nbefore it for two years, when there were not five hundred men on the\r\nisland, without attempting it. Now they had had time to fortify it,\r\nwe persisted in the conquest. Both Hawke and Boscawen[90] earnestly\r\ndissuaded the enterprise. Yet Pitt was obdurate; and the island was\r\ntaken at last by the beginning of June, after an enormous waste of\r\nmoney, and the loss of some men. There fell Sir William Williams, a\r\ngallant and ambitious young man, who had devoted himself both to war\r\nand politics. The island is a barren rock; and it was only to humour\r\nMr. Pitt, that France, in the succeeding negotiations, condescended to\r\ntreat it as an object of the smallest importance.\r\n\r\nThe indecent and injudicious precipitation with which the Favourite’s\r\nfaction hurried towards peace, justified any steadiness Mr. Pitt\r\ncould exert to keep the balance where he had placed it, in our own\r\nhands. Newcastle and Hardwicke, either not perceiving the symptoms\r\nof their own fall, or hoping to ward off the evil hour, truckled to\r\nthe Favourite’s views. The Duke of Bedford (who in his heart admired\r\nPitt, but was made to hate him by Rigby, at the instigation of Fox,\r\nand inflamed by the coldness with which Pitt had listened to the\r\nrepresentations made by his Grace, on the opposition to him in Ireland)\r\nwas, avowedly, pacific; and all of them seemed united against the\r\nwarlike minister. Lord Talbot went so far as to press the dismission\r\nof him. But it was Lord Bute’s nature to provoke first, before he\r\noffended. Gallitzin, the Russian minister, was reprimanded by him for\r\ncarrying the proposition of peace to Mr. Pitt, instead of to him;\r\nthough it had been usual, while Lord Holderness held the Seals, for\r\nthe foreign ministers in his department to address themselves to the\r\neffective minister. Mr. Pitt’s temper, soured by these associations\r\nand contradictions, broke out first against the Duke of Newcastle. At\r\na great council held on the 23rd of April, Mr. Pitt, who had been wont\r\nto affirm, that too much could not be spent on the war in Germany,\r\nmade severe complaint of the extravagance in the management of it; and\r\nimputed it to the fault of our commissaries, that Prince Ferdinand had\r\nbeen disabled from making greater progress there. Himself, he said,\r\nwithin six months, would move for an inquiry into the conduct of the\r\nwar. The Duke of Bedford took up the contrary side with warmth, and\r\nmade a speech that was much admired; and so little attention was paid\r\nto the views of Mr. Pitt, that it was settled Mr. Stanley[91] and\r\nMonsieur de Bussy should be exchanged to conduct the negotiation. Bussy\r\nwas an Abbé of parts, who had formerly resided here as minister,[92]\r\nand had given much offence to the late King whom he treated so\r\nimpertinently, that the King, asking him one day in the circle, “Ce\r\nqu’il y avoit de nouveau à Paris?” Bussy replied with contemptuous\r\nfamiliarity, “Sire, il y gêle.” He had again been imposed on that\r\nPrince, when the French dictated to him a neutrality for Hanover. Bussy\r\nwas not likely to be so presumptuous now. Yet France, trusting to our\r\npusillanimous impatience for peace, had the confidence to demand, that\r\nthe man-of-war that carried over Stanley should bring back Bussy.\r\nBut Mr. Pitt was yet minister; the proposal was rejected; and it was\r\nsettled that Stanley and Bussy should be at Dover and Calais on the\r\n22nd.\r\n\r\nBefore the departure of Stanley, it was agitated in Council, whether he\r\nshould be entrusted with full powers. Mr. Pitt, who had named Stanley\r\nfrom opinion of his abilities, though at that time disunited from him\r\nand gone over to Newcastle, confided in this nomination, and thought it\r\nwould leave himself master of the negotiation, if Stanley, who by being\r\nat Paris was in his department, were charged with conclusive powers;\r\nfor which, therefore, Pitt and Lord Temple pleaded. But Bute, and the\r\nrest of the Council, who chose not to let the negotiation pass out of\r\ntheir own hands, prevailed to have Stanley’s instructions limited.\r\n\r\nDuring these discussions died two considerable men, Archibald Duke\r\nof Argyle, and Hoadley Bishop of Winchester. The character of\r\nthe former[93] has been sufficiently set forth in my preceding\r\nMemoirs. The last will be known by his writings, and as long as a\r\nChurchman, combating for the liberties of mankind, shall be an unusual\r\nphenomenon.[94] Argyle had the lowest opinion of his nephew, Lord\r\nBute, who he had foretold would rush into power without having formed\r\na plan. The nephew had in truth too little capacity, and too much\r\npresumption, to let himself be guided by so shrewd a relation, though\r\nthe uncle would not have been obdurate if proper deference had been\r\npaid to his oracle. The last effort of this great Lord’s power in\r\nScotland had miscarried. The city of Edinburgh had recurred, as usual,\r\nto his nomination for the election of their representative; that is,\r\nof thirty-three electors, twenty-two still acknowledged their ancient\r\ndictator. He named Forester, an able Scottish counsellor, but always\r\nresident in England. Six days before the election such violent papers\r\nwere dispersed against Forester, as too much an Englishman, that the\r\nCity did not dare to put him in nomination, but were forced to choose\r\ntheir own Provost. How much did Scotland afterwards resent parallel\r\nnationalities, when exercised against them!\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Tweedale[95] succeeded the Duke of Argyle, as Chief\r\nJusticiary; and Bishop Thomas, of Salisbury, the King’s former\r\npreceptor, was made Bishop of Winchester. Drummond,[96] of St. Asaph,\r\nwhom Newcastle had destined to Winchester, succeeded. Thomas Earl\r\nPowis was made Comptroller of the Household on the death of Lord\r\nEdgcumbe.[97]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  Solemn and unusual Summons of the Council.--Announcement of\r\n    the King’s intended Marriage with the Princess of Mecklenberg\r\n    Strelitz.--The Princess Dowager’s aversion to her Son’s\r\n    Marriage.--The King’s attachment to Lady Sarah Lenox.--Schemes\r\n    of Mr. Fox.--Remarkable Speech of the King to Lady Susan\r\n    Strangways.--Frustration of Fox’s Intrigues.--Colonel Graeme\r\n    despatched to Germany to select a Queen.--The King’s deference\r\n    to his mother, and acceptance of the Bride she had chosen.--Lady\r\n    Sarah Lenox.--Serious Crisis in the Cabinet.--Lofty Conduct of\r\n    Mr. Pitt.--His Draught for a Treaty with France.--Reception of\r\n    this by the other Ministers.--Arrival of the new Queen.--Her\r\n    mental and personal Characteristics.--Anecdotes.--Disposal of the\r\n    vacant Bishopricks.--Lord Talbot.--Coronation Squabbles.--Sir\r\n    William Stanhope’s bitter Speech against the Scotch.--Lord Talbot\r\n    and the Barons of the Cinque Ports.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the attention of mankind hung on the negotiation, the King’s\r\nmessengers were suddenly sent forth to all Privy Councillors to meet\r\nat one o’clock, at St. James’s, July 8th, on urgent and important\r\nbusiness. The business itself was an absolute secret. Every body\r\nconcluded that so solemn and unusual a summons of the Council was to\r\ngive fuller sanction to peace. How great was the general surprise\r\nwhen they heard his Majesty had convened this assembly to notify\r\nhis intended marriage with the Princess of Mecklenberg Strelitz! A\r\nresolution taken and conducted with so much mystery, that till that\r\nhour perhaps not six men in England knew such a princess existed.\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned with what aversion the Princess Dowager had\r\nopposed a marriage projected by the late King between his heir apparent\r\nand a very accomplished Princess of Brunswick. A wife for her son, not\r\nchosen by herself nor obliged to her, by no means suited the views of\r\nthe Princess. Could she have chained up his body, as she fettered his\r\nmind, it is probable she would have preferred his remaining single. A\r\nmistress would have been more tremendous than a wife. The next brother,\r\nthe Duke of York, was not equally tractable, had expressed little\r\nreverence for his mother, and much antipathy to her favourite. If the\r\nKing should die and leave even an infant, a minority did not deprive\r\nthe Princess of all prospect of protracting her rule.\r\n\r\nBut there had happened circumstances still more pressing, more\r\nalarming. The King was fallen in love with Lady Sarah Lenox, sister of\r\nthe Duke of Richmond; a very young lady of the most blooming beauty,\r\nand shining with all the graces of unaffected, but animated nature.\r\nWhat concurred to make her formidable to the mother and Favourite,\r\nwas, her being under the tutorage of Mr. Fox, her eldest sister’s[98]\r\nhusband; and in truth, she and her family spared no assiduity to fix\r\nthe young monarch’s heart. And though Fox would probably not have\r\nbeen scrupulous or delicate on the terms of cementing that union, the\r\nKing’s overtures were so encouraging, that Fox’s views extended even\r\nto placing the young lady on the throne. Early in the winter, the King\r\ntold Lady Susan Strangways,[99] Mr. Fox’s niece, and the confidant of\r\nLady Sarah, that he hoped she (Lady Susan) would not go out of town\r\nsoon. She said, she should. “But,” replied the King, “you will return\r\nin summer, for the coronation?” Lady Susan answered, “I do not know; I\r\nhope so.” “But,” said the King again, “they talk of a wedding. There\r\nhave been many proposals; but I think an English match would do better\r\nthan a foreign one. Pray, tell Lady Sarah Lenox I say so.” The next\r\ntime Lady Sarah went to Court (and her family took care that should not\r\nbe seldom) the King said, “he hoped Lady Susan had told her his last\r\nconversation.”\r\n\r\nThe Junto was not blind to these whispers and dialogues. Lady Bute was\r\ninstructed to endeavour to place herself in the circle, and prevent\r\nthem. And the Princess Augusta marked her observation of what was going\r\nforward to Lady Sarah herself, laughing in her face, and trying to\r\naffront her. But Fox was not to be so rebuffed. Though he went himself\r\nto bathe in the sea (possibly to disguise his intrigues), he left Lady\r\nSarah at Holland House,[100] where she appeared every morning in a\r\nfield close to the great road (where the King passed on horseback) in a\r\nfancied habit, making hay.\r\n\r\nSuch mutual propensity fixed the resolution of the Princess. One\r\nColonel Graeme was despatched in the most private manner as a\r\ntraveller, and vested with no character, to visit various little\r\nProtestant Courts, and make report of the qualifications of the several\r\nunmarried Princesses. Beauty, and still less, talents, were not, it is\r\nlikely, the first object of his instructions. On the testimony of this\r\nman, the golden apple was given to the Princess of Mecklenburg; and the\r\nmarriage precipitately concluded. The ambassador was too remarkable\r\nnot to be farther mentioned. This Graeme, then, was a notorious\r\nJacobite, and had been engaged in the late rebellion. On a visit he\r\nmade to Scotland, his native country, after this embassy, David Hume,\r\nthe historian, said to him, “Colonel Graeme, I congratulate you on\r\nhaving exchanged the dangerous employment of making Kings, for the more\r\nlucrative province of making Queens.”\r\n\r\nSo complete was the King’s deference to the will of his mother, that\r\nhe blindly accepted the bride she had chosen for him; though, to the\r\nvery day of the council, he carried on his courtship to Lady Sarah;\r\nand she did not doubt of receiving the crown from him, till she heard\r\nthe public declaration of its being designed for another. Yet, in\r\nconfirmation of the trust he had reposed in Lady Susan Strangways,\r\nhimself appointed Lady Sarah to be one of the bridemaids to the Queen.\r\nYet Lord Bute’s friends affected to give another turn to the story;\r\nand insisted that the King had never thought of Lady Sarah but for his\r\nmistress. All, they affirmed, he had said to Lady Susan was, to bid\r\nher ask Lady Sarah if she should like a place in the family of the\r\nnew Queen; that she had accepted it; and that the King had destined\r\nher to be Mistress of the Robes. Her surprise and disappointment,\r\nhowever, were too strongly marked to make this legend credible. Lady\r\nSusan adhered to the truth of what she had reported, in various\r\nexaminations by her father and uncle. And the resentment Lady Sarah\r\nexpressed, and which caused, as the Court said, her not being placed\r\nabout the new Queen, was proof enough on which side the truth lay. The\r\nJunto persuaded the King she was a bad young woman; but if she was,\r\nwhat hindered her becoming his mistress? Was it criminal to propose\r\nbeing his wife rather than his mistress? And what became of the King’s\r\nboasted piety, if he intended to place his mistress about his wife?\r\nSome coquet attempts, which Lady Sarah afterwards made to recover\r\nhis notice, and her stooping to bear the Queen’s train as bridemaid,\r\ndid her more prejudice than all that was invented against her. Pique\r\nand extreme youth might excuse both; and her soon after preferring a\r\nclergyman’s son to several great matches, gave evidence that ambition\r\nwas not a rooted passion in her.\r\n\r\nIn my own opinion, the King had thoughts of her as a wife; but wanted\r\nresolution to oppose his mother and Lord Bute. Fortunately, no doubt,\r\nin this instance; for the daughter of a subject, and the sister-in-law\r\nof so ambitious and exceptionable a man as Fox, would probably have\r\nbeen productive of most serious consequences. To avoid returning to\r\nthis topic, I will only remember, that during the wedding-service, on\r\nmention of Abraham and Sarah, the King could not conceal his confusion.\r\nAnd the day following, when everybody was presented to the Queen, Lord\r\nWestmoreland,[101] old and dimsighted, seeing Lady Sarah in the rich\r\nhabit of bridemaid, mistook her for Queen, and was going to kneel and\r\nkiss her hand.\r\n\r\nBut while the arrival of the Queen was expected, and the approaching\r\nceremonies of the wedding and coronation engrossed the attention of\r\nthe public, affairs grew towards a serious crisis in the Cabinet.\r\nPrince Ferdinand had opened the campaign with vivacity and advantage,\r\ndriving the French before him, and seizing, or reducing them to\r\ndestroy great part of their magazines; a success that enabled him to\r\nform the sieges of Ziegenhayn and Cassel. Marshal Broglio was not\r\ndisheartened or inactive; but re-assembling his dispersed troops, he\r\nattacked the Hereditary Prince, and routed the body under his command;\r\nin consequence of which the sieges were raised, and Prince Ferdinand\r\nretired, abandoning the whole country of Hesse to the enemy. This\r\nadvantage, it was apprehended, would make France less eager for peace.\r\nYet she continued the negotiation with much appearance of warmth; and\r\nthough she was far from bringing all the facilities our Court wished\r\nfor, the conclusion of the treaty seemed to be rather impeded by the\r\nloftiness and firmness of Mr. Pitt, than by the insincerity of France.\r\nStill, as it afterwards appeared, she had secret resources in reserve;\r\nnor could she fail to hope but Mr. Pitt might be displaced, and her\r\ncondition mended, when the administration should fall into the hands of\r\nmen whose honour was not so much concerned in the event of the war, and\r\nwho had national honour much less at heart. The transactions have been\r\nprinted, and will appear in every common history. My part is to relate\r\nby what steps and intrigues the negotiation was broken off.\r\n\r\nIn the end of August, the council had ordered their ultimate\r\nconcessions to be drawn and sent to France. Mr. Pitt made the draught\r\nand carried it to Council. The other ministers thought it spoke his\r\nsense, not theirs; or rather, contained more of an ultimatum than they\r\nwere disposed to adhere to. In defence of his own inflexibility, Mr.\r\nPitt spoke largely on the _haughtiness_ of France.\r\n\r\nLord Hardwicke[102] said he approved our not submitting to their\r\nhaughtiness, and congratulated his country in not having been behind\r\nhand with them in that respect. Lord Granville[103] took the draught,\r\nand applauded it exceedingly; said it deserved to be inserted in the\r\nActa Regia; but for his part he did not love fine letters on business.\r\nHe thought even bad Latin preferable to good in negotiations.\r\n\r\nThese speeches raised Pitt’s choler; and with reason. He had vindicated\r\nthe honour of his country; and now was supporting it with a dignity it\r\nhad never known since the days of Cromwell. He saw himself abandoned\r\nand ridiculed by his master’s ministers; but he was not a man to recoil\r\nbefore such adversaries. If he had assumed an unwarrantable tone, his\r\nsituation might well justify it. He broke out with great asperity, and\r\ntold them dictatorially, they should not alter an iota of the letter.\r\nRhodomontade had been too favourite a figure with Lord Granville to\r\nleave him the dupe of it in another man. He himself had made glory but\r\na step to ambition, instead of making ambition a footstool to glory.\r\nHe neither admired Pitt’s exalted diction, nor exalted views; and\r\ncontinuing to canvass the point with him, said, he had understood from\r\nBussy--“From Bussy,” interrupted Pitt; “nor you, nor any of you shall\r\ntreat with Bussy: nobody shall but myself.”\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Bedford, whom the rest always summoned when they wanted to\r\ncombat Pitt and did not dare, said, “he did not know why he was called\r\nto council, if he was not at liberty to debate; and since he was told\r\nthey were not to be permitted to alter an iota, he would come thither\r\nno more,” and retired. Some of the others were less stout. Lord Bute\r\nsaid little, but that he thought the King’s honour was concerned in\r\nsticking to our own terms; and therefore he should be for adhering to\r\nthem. This short turn in the Favourite produced a like sentiment in\r\nsome who waited on his nod. Besides Mr. Pitt and Lord Temple, the\r\nChancellor, Lord Halifax, and Lord Ligonier assented to the Favourite’s\r\nopinion; Hardwicke, Newcastle, Mansfield, and Granville adhered to\r\nthe softer method. The Duke of Devonshire remained, who had uttered\r\nno opinion. At last he said, if they were not permitted to alter\r\nthe draught of the letter (which implied his inclination to have it\r\naltered), he should give no opinion. Mr. Pitt asked what he should\r\nreport to the King as his Grace’s advice? He replied as he had said\r\nbefore, “he would give no opinion.”\r\n\r\nNewcastle was alarmed, and jealous of the sudden and unexpected turn\r\nLord Bute had taken, but was soon satisfied by his Lordship that he was\r\nin no connection with Mr. Pitt; and, indeed, it is probable that he had\r\nonly been overawed, and had apprehended being taxed by Pitt with any\r\nunpopular measure. On the 25th, another council was held, to which,\r\nnotwithstanding his declaration, the Duke of Bedford returned. He and\r\nDevonshire seemed to have no concern but lest any wayward humour of\r\nNewcastle should be crossed. Pitt at this council was more temperate,\r\nand submitted to some small concessions.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of September, the new Queen landed at Harwich. Lord\r\nHarcourt,[104] whose peace had been made by Lord Talbot, had been sent\r\nto fetch her, with the Duchesses of Ancaster[105] and Hamilton;[106]\r\nbut as an earnest of the prison prepared for her, and to keep her\r\nin that state of ignorance which was essential to the views of the\r\nPrincess, they were forbidden to see her alone. Her mother, who died\r\nduring the treaty of marriage, ordered her to put herself entirely into\r\nthe hands of the Princess. Mrs. Katherine Dashwood,[107] of a Jacobite\r\nfamily, and intimate of Lady Bute, was destined to live in the palace.\r\nNo privy purse was allowed to the Queen, but Mr. Stone[108] received\r\ntwenty thousand pounds a year to pay her servants.\r\n\r\nShe had been educated in that strict course of piety, which in Germany\r\nreaches to superstition; a habit in which she was encouraged to such a\r\ndegree, that when the King visited his mother, which he soon, at the\r\ndesire of the Princess, began to do, without the Queen, she was afraid\r\nof staying alone, and retired to her two German women; her English\r\nladies not being suffered to keep her company. Yet this weakness\r\nseemed solely the result of a bad education. Her temper appeared to be\r\nlively, and her understanding sensible and quick. Great good-nature,\r\nset off by much grace in her manner, recommended all she said. Her\r\nperson was small, and very lean, but well made. Her face pale and\r\nhomely, her nose something flat, her mouth very large. Her hair was of\r\na fine brown, and her countenance pleasing.\r\n\r\nWhen first she saw the palace she trembled. The Duchess of Hamilton\r\nsmiled. The Queen said, “You may laugh; you have been married twice;\r\nbut it is no joke to me.” The King received her in the garden of St.\r\nJames’s; she would have kneeled, but he raised and embraced her, and\r\nled her to the Princess, where they and Lady Augusta dined together.\r\nBetween nine and ten at night they went to chapel. The Duke of\r\nCumberland gave her away; and after the ceremony they appeared for a\r\nfew minutes in the drawing-room, and then went to supper. She played\r\nand sung, for music was her passion, but she loved other amusements\r\ntoo, and had been accustomed to them; but excepting her music, all the\r\nrest were retrenched; nor was she[109] ever suffered to play at cards,\r\nwhich she loved. While she was dressing, she was told the King liked\r\nsome particular manner of dress. She said, “Let him dress himself;\r\nI shall dress as I please.” They told her he liked early hours; she\r\nreplied, she did not, and “qu’elle ne voulait pas se coucher avec les\r\npoules.” A few weeks taught her how little power she had acquired with\r\na Crown. The affection she conceived for the King softened the rigour\r\nof her captivity. Yet now and then a sigh stole out, and now and then\r\nshe attempted, though in vain, to enlarge her restraint. What must have\r\npenetrated deeper, was, that policy did not seem to be the sole motive\r\nof the mortifications she endured. At times there entered a little\r\nwantonness of power into the Princess’s treatment of her. The King made\r\nher frequent presents of magnificent jewels; and as if diamonds were\r\nempire, she was never allowed to appear in public without them. The\r\nfirst time she received the sacrament, she begged not to wear them, one\r\npious command of her mother having been, not to use jewels at her first\r\ncommunion. The King indulged her; but Lady Augusta carrying this tale\r\nto her mother, the Princess obliged the King to insist on the jewels,\r\nand the poor young Queen’s tears and terrors could not dispense with\r\nher obedience.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the Coronation the vacant Bishopricks were bestowed. The\r\nArchbishoprick of York was given to Dr. Drummond;[110] and Hayter[111]\r\nof Norwich, who had been disgraced with Lord Harcourt, was, by the\r\ninterest of the same patron, Lord Talbot, promoted to the See of\r\nLondon. Newcastle vehemently opposed it, and solicited for Thomas\r\nof Lincoln,[112] but received this thundering sentence from Lord\r\nBute:--“If Thomas is such a favourite with your Grace, why did not you\r\nprefer him when you had the power?” The Duke, however, obtained the\r\nmitre of Norwich for Dr. Yonge; and being bidden to observe that the\r\nKing’s answer to the address of Oxford on his marriage was kinder than\r\nthat to Cambridge, he replied, it is true; but two of the new Bishops\r\nare Cambridge men--so easily did he comfort himself even with the\r\nshadow of power!\r\n\r\nHere ended, almost as soon as it began, the credit of Lord Talbot.\r\nHe was sometimes well, sometimes ill with Lord Bute, and though\r\nremaining in favour at Court, never seemed to have any influence\r\nthere. A trifling circumstance, because it occasioned an event that\r\nmade much noise afterwards, must be mentioned. As Lord Steward, Lord\r\nTalbot composed part of that ridiculous pageant at the coronation, the\r\nentry of the Champion. So fond was Lord Talbot of his share in this\r\nmummery, that he rehearsed his part on his steed in Westminster-hall,\r\nand carried his new Bishop of London to be witness of his feats. The\r\nDuke of York calling Hayter, who was lame, up to the _haut pas_, which\r\nhe ascended with difficulty, the Bishop said, “You see, sir, how hard\r\nit is for me to get a step.” When the day came, Lord Talbot piqued\r\nhimself on not turning his back to the King, and produced a strange\r\nhubbub of laughter by trying to force his horse to retire backwards\r\nout of the hall. With the City, with the Knights of the Bath, and the\r\nBarons of the Cinque Ports, Lord Talbot had various squabbles, by\r\nretrenching their tables at the coronation. Beckford told him it was\r\nhard if the citizens should have no dinner, when they were to give\r\nthe King one, which would cost them ten thousand pounds. This menace\r\nprevailed. Sir William Stanhope, brother of Lord Chesterfield, a man of\r\nnot less wit, and of more ill-nature than his elder, said, “It was an\r\naffront to the Knights of the Bath; for _some_ of us,” added he, “are\r\n_gentlemen_.” It was a more bitter speech he made against the Scotch\r\nand their Protectress. “He would not go to Court,” he said, “for fear\r\nof the itch, which would reduce him to go to the Princess’s Court for\r\nbrimstone.” To the Barons of the Cinque Ports Lord Talbot said, “If\r\nthey came to him as Lord Steward, their request could not be granted;\r\nif, as Lord Talbot, he was a match for any of them.” This boisterous\r\nand absurd behaviour drew aside much odium from the Favourite; but as\r\npuppet-shows were not exhibited every day, the zany was forgotten, and\r\nthe hisses of the mob soon fastened on the principal performer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  Interposition of Spain in behalf of France.--The Duke of Bedford\r\n    and Bussy.--Mr. Pitt’s indignation at the demands of Spain.--\r\n    Resignation of Mr. Pitt and Lord Temple.--Exultation of Lord\r\n    Bute and other Ministers.--Lord Talbot’s advice to the Duke of\r\n    Newcastle.--Effect on the Nation of Mr. Pitt’s Secession from\r\n    the Cabinet.--His acceptance of a Peerage for his wife, and of a\r\n    pension.--Insidious conduct of the Court.--Mr. Pitt’s Successors\r\n    in Office.--George Grenville.--Injudicious Conduct of Mr.\r\n    Pitt.--Address to him from the Common Council of London, and from\r\n    Provincial Towns.--Mrs. Anne Pitt’s sarcasm against her brother.--\r\n    Meeting of Parliament.--Choice of a Speaker.--Sir John Cust.--\r\n    The King’s Speech.--The Address.--Lord Temple’s Speech.--The\r\n    King and Royal Family dine in the City with the Lord Mayor.--Mr.\r\n    Pitt’s reception in Guildhall.--Riots.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not without reason that the nation took an alarm, when almost\r\nall who conducted our affairs were determined to take none. Spain\r\nfor some time had interposed officiously in behalf of France, which,\r\nsaid the Spaniards, was sufficiently humbled, and must not be ruined.\r\nIt was known that they had furnished her with money; and, as if they\r\nsought an open breach with us, they demanded for all Spain the same\r\nprivilege as Biscay and two other provinces enjoyed, of fishing on\r\nthe coasts of Newfoundland. This was peremptorily refused; and had\r\nMr. Pitt’s influence been equal to his spirit, Lord Bristol[113] had\r\nbeen immediately recalled from Madrid. But the other ministers, who\r\ndesired nothing better than an excuse for their pusillanimity, begged\r\nto temporize. They pretended to dread being overpowered, but were more\r\nafraid of a new field being opened to success. The Spanish ministers\r\nof the French faction had blown up their opinionative and ignorant\r\nPrince[114] with ideas of holding the balance between England and\r\nFrance: but the old Spaniards lamented a system so abhorrent from the\r\ntrue interest of their country. The King of Spain was possessed with\r\na notion that his lights were equal to his grandeur. He listened, or\r\nthought he listened, to no advice: but if anything is more fatal to\r\na nation than a foolish indolent Prince, it is a foolish one that\r\nis active and obstinate. Our ministers cried out against a war with\r\nSpain as unnatural; but when the interest of Spain did not direct\r\nSpain, were we to act as if it did? The Duke of Bedford, who, like Don\r\nCarlos, could be made to take half of what he meant for the whole, was\r\nclamorous against a Spanish war; and as he always compensated for the\r\narguments he leaped over, by excess on the other side, he told Bussy\r\nhe was sorry for his departure, as we were no longer in a situation to\r\nmake war.[115]\r\n\r\nBussy, however, still lingered, and invented frivolous excuses to\r\npalliate his delay. Lord Hardwicke, considering a treaty in the light\r\nof a bill in Chancery, begged some _binding_ words might be inserted\r\nin the treaty. But Mr. Pitt had fixed his resolution. It was by\r\none bold stroke to assert the honour of his country, or to quit the\r\nrudder. He insisted that a fleet of twelve or fourteen men-of-war\r\nshould be instantly sent to Cadiz; and that Lord Bristol should be\r\nordered to demand a sight of the treaty between Spain and France;\r\nand if not accorded, to leave Madrid without delay. When Spain had\r\ngiven such indications of her partiality to France, nothing could\r\nbe more justifiable than this measure. But Spain had not restrained\r\nherself within the bounds of favour. In the midst of the negotiation\r\nbetween us and France, to which Spain pretended to offer herself as\r\nguarantee, she had committed a most flagrant and unheard-of instance\r\nof taking part, nay, of adding herself as a party to the grievances\r\ncomplained of. Bussy, tolerated here as a negotiator, and without even\r\na character from his own Court, presented to Mr. Pitt a cavalier note\r\nin the name of Spain, demanding restitution of some prizes we had\r\nmade on Spain during the war, satisfaction for the violation of their\r\nterritory by the navy of England, liberty of fishery on Newfoundland,\r\nand destruction of our settlements on the Spanish territory, in the\r\nbay of Honduras. A power in amity with us, and affecting to act as\r\nmediator, selects our enemy’s agent to convey their complaints!--what\r\ncould surpass this insult?--the patience of our ministers under such\r\nindignity--not of Mr. Pitt. He replied with the majesty of the Crown he\r\nserved,--the vengeance of that Crown slept in other hands.\r\n\r\nHis hands tied, the nation affronted, and duped by the partial breaking\r\noff of the treaty with France, no proper resentment permitted against\r\nSpain, Mr. Pitt found he could do no farther good. His character had\r\nbeen lost by acquiescence; and nothing could rouse the nation, but\r\nhis quitting the sphere of business, where he was so treacherously\r\ncontrolled. He had desired to enter his protest in the council books\r\nagainst the temporizing advice of his colleagues. He and Lord Temple\r\ndelivered to the King their reasons and advice for a war with Spain;\r\nand October 2nd Mr. Pitt took leave of the Council, thanking the\r\nministers of the late King for the support they had given to the war;\r\nand on the fifth he resigned the Seals. Lord Temple quitted on the\r\nninth following.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say which exulted most on this occasion, France,\r\nSpain, or Lord Bute, for Mr. Pitt was the common enemy of all three.\r\nNewcastle, Hardwicke, Bedford, Devonshire, Mansfield and Fox were not\r\nless pleased,[116] for they had all concurred to thwart his plan. Lord\r\nTalbot alone, though of the same faction, seemed to see farther than\r\nany of them. He advised the Duke of Newcastle, “not to die for joy on\r\nthe Monday, nor for fear on the Tuesday.”\r\n\r\nThe nation was thunderstruck, alarmed, and indignant. The City of\r\nLondon proposed to address the King to know why Mr. Pitt was dismissed?\r\nbut it being replied, that the King would tell them he had not\r\ndismissed Mr. Pitt, but had wished him to continue in employment,\r\nthe motion dropped. Some proposed a general mourning; others, more\r\nreasonable, to thank Mr. Pitt for his services; but this too was\r\ndamped; for the Favourite’s agents were not idle, and insinuated that\r\nMr. Pitt had acted with mischievous views; for they who were incapable\r\nof great views, were excellent in undermining. The King was advised to\r\nheap rewards on his late minister. The Princess pressed it eagerly.\r\nA peerage, a vast pension, the government of Canada (as a mark that\r\nit was not to be restored at the peace), were offered to him. He had\r\nthe frailty to accept a peerage for his wife, and a pension of three\r\nthousand a year for three lives!\r\n\r\nThe Court, impatient to notify their triumph, and to blast his\r\npopularity at once, could not resist the impulse of publishing\r\nin the very next night’s Gazette, Mr. Pitt’s acceptance of their\r\nboons[117]--the first instance, I believe, of a pension ever specified\r\nin that paper.[118] At the same time, to decry his councils, and to\r\nstigmatize them with rashness, they added an article from Spain,\r\nsetting forth the pacific intentions of that Court. But in this\r\ninstance their ardour outran their discretion, for the article\r\npublished was dated September 4th. Other letters had been received from\r\nthence of the 8th, which not being divulged, implied that the letters\r\nof the 8th were of a hostile cast, and consequently justified Mr.\r\nPitt’s sentiments. Subsequent events were a still clearer vindication\r\nof his conduct.\r\n\r\nThe Seals, which Mr. Pitt had resigned, were given to Lord Egremont;\r\nand his brother-in-law, George Grenville, was entrusted with the\r\nmanagement of the House of Commons. Grenville had been destined for\r\nSpeaker; an office to which his drudgery was suited; and which being\r\nproperly the most neutral place in government, would have excused him\r\nfrom entering into the contest between Mr. Pitt and the Favourite.\r\nBut Grenville’s temper, though plodding and laborious, had not the\r\nusual concomitant, prudence. He lent himself to the views of Lord\r\nBute, to promote his own. Lord Temple, who had as little decency as\r\nhis brother George had judgment, was exasperated beyond measure; broke\r\nout in bitter invectives against him, and threatened to leave from him\r\nthe paternal estate and give it to James, the third brother, who had\r\nresigned with him and Mr. Pitt.\r\n\r\nThe public, though staggered by the pension, did not abandon their\r\nidol. At first the Common Council, which had been summoned to thank him\r\nfor his services, dropped the intention, and separated, after voting an\r\naddress to Parliament for widening the streets. But on one hand, Lord\r\nTemple’s zeal kept alive the flame; and on the other, the rancour with\r\nwhich Lord Bute’s and Fox’s partisans pursued Mr. Pitt, only served to\r\nalarm the nation, and to endear the man to them who they saw suffered\r\nfor his patriotism. Yet his own conduct was not judicious. Incensed at\r\nthe abuse thrown on him, he wrote a letter into the City to explain his\r\nresignation, pleading that he had no longer been allowed to _guide_. A\r\nterm so engrossing gave offence, and handle to ridicule. Fox’s agents\r\ndid not overlook it, but published some cutting pamphlets on Pitt’s\r\narrogance. Yet his condescending to appeal to the City against the\r\nCourt bore down all opposition. The Common Council agreed to thank him,\r\nand to instruct their members; and though Paterson, an agent of Fox,\r\nopposed the motion, it was carried by 109 to 15. The contagion soon\r\nspread, even to part of Scotland. Stirling, Exeter, York, Chester, and\r\nother cities and towns, complimented Mr. Pitt on his conduct.\r\n\r\nHis own sister, Mrs. Anne Pitt, who was of the opposite faction,\r\nfurnished his enemies with a severe sarcasm. She had been Maid of\r\nHonour to Queen Caroline, and was warmly attached to her brother, with\r\nwhom she lived. On his promotion to the Pay-office, he had shaken\r\nher off in an unbecoming manner. She had excellent parts and strong\r\npassions. Lord Bolingbroke had recommended her to the late Prince, on\r\nwhose death she had been made Privy-purse to the Princess: but being\r\nof an intriguing and most ambitious nature, she soon destroyed her own\r\nprospect by an impetuosity to govern her mistress, and by embarking\r\nin other Cabals at that Court. Her disgrace followed, but without\r\ndismission; on which she had retired to France. On her return, though\r\nshe could never recover the favour of the Princess, she so successfully\r\ncultivated the patronage of Lord and Lady Bute, that she kept her\r\nground at Leicester Fields, and obtained a large pension. This she\r\nhad notified by letter to her brother. He had coldly replied, that he\r\ncongratulated her on the addition to her fortune, but was grieved to\r\nsee the name of Pitt in a list of pensions.[119] On his accepting\r\none, she copied his own letter, turning it against himself; and though\r\nrestrained by her friends from sending it to him, she repeated what she\r\nhad done, till it became the common talk of the town.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of November the Parliament met. George Grenville made a very\r\nhandsome panegyric on the late Speaker; and then the House proceeded to\r\nthe election of his successor. The choice had been very difficult: not\r\nfrom the number of competitors, but from a total deficiency of proper\r\nsubjects. Grenville, who would have filled the chair with spirit and\r\nknowledge, had been taken off to a province, for which he was far less\r\nqualified. Lord Bute had solicited Prowse[120] to accept the office,\r\nwho was the most knowing and the most moderate of the Tories, but\r\nhe had declined from bad health. The Duke of Newcastle had proposed\r\nBacon,[121] who had more Whiggism than abilities; but the Favourite\r\ndetermined on Sir John Cust,[122] who was a Tory, and had nothing but\r\nindustry; he was indeed a very poor creature. Lord Barrington named\r\nhim, his friend Lord Egmont praised him, and he was chosen.\r\n\r\nTwo nights before, at a meeting of the principal men in the House\r\nof Commons, to hear the King’s Speech, and the respondent Address,\r\nread, Charles Townshend, who was offended at the lead being assigned\r\nto Grenville, found fault that there was no mention of the militia.\r\nGrenville said, it was not usual to insert anything in the Address\r\nwhich was not touched upon in the Speech; and added, that he found\r\nthere were very different opinions in members of Parliament on the\r\nusefulness of the militia. Lord Barrington and Charles Yorke supported\r\nGrenville: Stanley agreed with Townshend, who again debated the\r\npoint with much warmth. The next night, at a larger meeting at the\r\nCockpit, Townshend recanted to Grenville all he had said, professed\r\nhe believed he had been infatuated, begged it might be forgotten, and\r\nthat Grenville would not take it to himself. Grenville replied, he had\r\nnot: that for himself he forgot it; as the King’s servant, he could not\r\nforget it.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th, the King made his speech. Lord Northumberland[123] and Lord\r\nBerkeley[124] of Stratton moved and seconded the Address. Lord Temple\r\nrose, and opened on his own and Mr. Pitt’s resignations, the motives\r\nto which he explained; found fault that no mention was made of the\r\nmilitia, and that the Parliament had not been thanked for establishing\r\nit. He talked on Court favour, and on those who disposed of all things;\r\nendeavouring to provoke Lord Bute to rise. He said, the crisis for a\r\nwar with Spain had been most advantageously held out to this country,\r\nand complained of those who had betrayed the secrets of our situation\r\nto Bussy. It was a time, he said, when a first minister was necessary;\r\nbut now, _who_ remained fit for that office? _Who_ thought himself\r\ncapable of _guiding_? He uttered this in his usual languid manner,\r\nthough the matter was not ill conceived; nor, though indiscreet, was\r\nhe so intemperate as had been expected. The Duke of Bedford replied\r\nwith much applause, and said, he did not know why the militia deserved\r\nmore thanks than the grant of regular troops. He declared,[125] upon\r\nhis honour, that he had told no such thing, as had been hinted at, to\r\nBussy; and concluded with hoping never to see a first minister. Lord\r\nShelburne, attached to Fox, and profuse of application to Lord Bute,\r\nspoke against the German war. The Duke of Marlborough[126] and Earl\r\nGower moved the congratulation to the Queen.\r\n\r\nThe decency of Lord Temple’s prelude to new opposition soon changed its\r\nhue in a manner more suited to his factious turbulence. On the 9th, the\r\nKing and all the Royal family dined in the City with the Lord Mayor.\r\nThither, too, went Mr. Pitt and Lord Temple in a chariot together,--a\r\nstep justly censured, and very nearly productive of fatal consequences.\r\nTo _them_ all acclamations were addressed; and the distinctions paid in\r\nthe Guildhall to Mr. Pitt, to the total neglect of the King, bestowed\r\nall the honour of the triumph on the former. Little was wanting to\r\nturn the pageant into a tragedy. Riots ensued, and many persons were\r\ninsulted. The Favourite had taken the precaution of having a guard of\r\nbutchers and bruisers; and by the defence of that convoy alone, escaped\r\nmischief. Sir Samuel Fludyer, the Lord Mayor, caused diligent inquiry\r\nto be made into the proceedings of the day, and learned that Beckford\r\nhimself had visited several public-houses over night, and had appointed\r\nringleaders to different stations, and had been the first to raise the\r\nhuzza in the hall on the entrance of Mr. Pitt. _His_ joining himself to\r\na pomp, dedicated to a Court that he had just quitted, was not decent.\r\nThe ambition of drawing to himself the homage of the people was not\r\nmodest. To offer himself as an incentive to civil tumult, and to how\r\ndangerous consequences he could not tell, was not a symptom of very\r\ninnocent intentions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Wilkes’s censures on the King’s Speech, seconded by Dempster.--\r\n    The Debate on continuing the War.--Speeches of Beckford, Cust,\r\n    Harvey, Forester, Pitt, and George Grenville.--The Queen’s Dowry\r\n    voted.--Ministerial Manœuvres on the secession of Mr. Pitt.--\r\n    Meeting at the St. Alban’s Tavern.--Discussion on the Militia\r\n    Act.--Speech, in the House of Commons, of Charles Townshend,\r\n    Secretary at War.--Policy of the Court.--Fox’s Faction.--Debate\r\n    on the War in Germany.--George Grenville’s desertion of Pitt.--\r\n    Pitt’s Reply.--Walpole’s Reflections on that Statesman.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of November the Address to the King was moved in the House\r\nof Commons by the Lords Middleton and Parker.[127] Mr. Wilkes,[128]\r\na man of whom much will be said hereafter, passed some censures on\r\nthe King’s speech, which, in the language of Parliament, he said, he\r\nwas authorized to call the speech of the minister; though of what\r\nminister he could not tell. The extraordinary Gazette, he said, which\r\nhad vaunted the pacific disposition of Spain, had been contradicted\r\nby facts: it had appeared that we were rather in a state of war with\r\nthat Crown. Yet no notice had been taken of those transactions in the\r\nspeech, though all mankind was apprised of their notorious insults.\r\nHe himself had seen a Spanish memorial, that had been delivered by a\r\nFrench agent. Unless some communication was made to Parliament, how\r\ncould Parliament lay the state of the nation before his Majesty? As\r\nlittle mention, he observed, was made of the militia, though the ground\r\non which the war had stood. Dempster,[129] a young Scotch member,\r\nseconded Wilkes, though less peremptory in opposition; for though he\r\npleaded for the extension of the militia to Scotland, and said the\r\nmilitia had felt the heavy hand of administration, yet he censured the\r\nGerman war, as having neither object nor end; condemned faction, and\r\nsaid, he was pleased to see that his Majesty had emancipated himself\r\nfrom the chains that had been prepared for him.\r\n\r\nBeckford, with his usual rhodomontade, said, our situation had never\r\nbeen so comfortable, nor the national union ever so complete. It was\r\nnot the mob, nor two hundred great Lords (who received more from\r\nGovernment than they paid to it), that made us so firm: the middling\r\nrank of men it was in which our strength consisted, and who called\r\nupon us to demand peace sword in hand. Nor had our abilities ever been\r\nso great. He was astonished our ministers--who they were he knew not,\r\nnor did he look on Grenville and those in the House of Commons but as\r\nsubalterns--were afraid of any power upon earth: he was amazed they\r\ncould suffer such memorials from Spain, so derogatory to our honour.\r\nThe answer should have been made by the mouth of cannon. The revenues\r\nof Spain were pitiful, were foreign: must be brought home,--and that\r\nwe might have prevented. You are near shore, continued he; will you\r\ngo back? and without a pilot? A King should not govern by a faction:\r\nthe late King had been governed by one, who resigned in the midst of\r\nrebellion, and flung an empty purse in his face; but we had now no Earl\r\nof Warwick, no king-makers. Hope must come from the rising generation:\r\nwe had tried the old in vain. The war in Germany _had_ an object, and\r\nhad almost obtained it. The French ought to be kept there. He did not\r\ndesire to see France and England engaged single-handed. France said,\r\nlet us both get out of Germany, for she felt the mischief of warring\r\nthere. The manner indeed in which we had conducted our affairs there,\r\nhad been too expensive; of which he produced instances: but speak out,\r\ncried he; will you quit all your allies? Two points must be obtained,\r\nthe security of America and of our fisheries. We had already conceded\r\ntoo much: he was sorry for it--was sorry Mr. Pitt had softened at\r\nall. He would be ready to second Mr. Wilkes in moving for the Spanish\r\npapers, and to know if they avowed Bussy.\r\n\r\nBeckford was answered by Cust[130] (the Speaker’s brother), and by\r\nHarvey;[131] the last, a lawyer; both of Tory families, and the latter\r\nvery sensible. The former spoke on the burthen of the war, and said,\r\nthat to raise six millions, we ran in debt two: this year would cost\r\nus between nine and ten. He would appeal to our very successes for the\r\nimpropriety of continuing the war. The King had told us he would never\r\ndepart from our true interest: if we never _had_ departed from it,\r\nwe should not be debating now. Harvey condemned the war in Germany,\r\nand justified the intentions of Spain. Fuentes had declared, that if\r\nhis Court had had any hostile designs, it would itself have made the\r\ndemands; but the other end of the town, said he, will always promote\r\na Spanish war: had done so in the last reign; had driven it on by the\r\nfeigned cruelties exercised on Captain Jenkins,[132] who, however,\r\ndied with his ears on his head. Forester, another and still shrewder\r\nlawyer, endeavoured to ward off the rising spirit by showing there was\r\nno such question before the House as what was then in debate, Wilkes\r\nnot having made any motion; (this was an usual art in old members, and\r\noften served the purpose;) nor was the militia more the subject of\r\nthe debate, nor as yet to come on. Thus was the House free from any\r\ninfluence but of gratitude to the militia, as they had been encamped\r\nwithout law, and only because we had a greater war abroad than we could\r\nbear. He hoped that night’s mail would not carry to the Continent news\r\nof disunion in the new Parliament.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt, on whom all eyes were fixed, rose; and said, he wished\r\nthe turn of the debate had permitted him to sit still; but he found\r\nhimself called upon. He professed great zeal for his Majesty and for\r\nthe administration, when it should be settled; and was desirous to\r\nleave his own justification to his past conduct. For the militia, he\r\nshould have been glad it had been mentioned in the speech. He had\r\nadvised that measure last year against the greater part of the Cabinet\r\nCouncil. For a war with Spain, the motives for it were not founded on\r\nthe French papers: those, he concluded, would be published here: the\r\nsilence of the ministers made him conclude so, or it would be unfair\r\ndealing with the Parliament. When those papers should appear, he would\r\nas a member of Parliament speak his opinion: did not desire on that\r\nquestion that any man should think with him, but form his judgment on\r\nthe fact itself. As the contrary sentiment had been adopted by his\r\nMajesty, he hoped not to have the bulk of the nation on his side. God\r\nalone knew what the opinion would be, when the whole should come out.\r\nThe probability was, that himself had been erroneous. His own situation\r\nwas awful; he stood there to be _examined_--hoped the ministers would\r\nproduce the advice, signed by Lord Temple and him, and delivered to\r\nhis Majesty. He would conceal nothing as far as was consistent with\r\nhis oath of Privy Councillor. Nor would he inflame--how could he--he,\r\nwho stood so unsupported? He had been taxed with assuming to _guide_.\r\nHe declared he had never abetted the publication of his letter to\r\nHodges--never had consented to its publication; but now published, he\r\ndid avow it. Early he had contracted an indifference to party-papers,\r\nand had rather read two passages in Virgil or Horace. He had resigned\r\nthe Seals, in order not to be responsible for measures he was no longer\r\nsuffered to _guide_, and from seeing the question of Spain in the light\r\nhe saw it. He had acted from conviction, as he supposed the great\r\nLords, who had opposed him, had done likewise. He blessed himself that\r\nno question had been moved that day to bar unanimity. All vigour was\r\nrecommended from the Throne: he would not have the post depart with\r\nmany arraignments of the German war, and without any minister saying\r\na word in its behalf. In their situation he would have lain by: did\r\nthey advise a speech of vigour, and yet hold their peace, when vigorous\r\nmeasures were condemned? Himself was never stopped by popularity, or\r\nby the turn of the tide. He would speak though a private man: hoped\r\nnever to be a public man again. He never would come into place again;\r\nhe never could; for he never could but by his own accord. He had been\r\nnursed in the lap of fortune, but now had not weight enough to make\r\nbut one Lord, with whom he would live and die, of his opinion. Hoped\r\nhis Majesty’s rest would not be disturbed, as his had been: he had\r\nbeen robbed of his sleep for many days, and now should be robbed of\r\nhis honour, if our troops were recalled from Germany. Nothing but that\r\nspectre of an invasion, which the Ministry had not had constancy\r\nenough to look at, had frightened us out of Mahon. So would it be\r\nagain, if the troops of France found themselves at liberty to quit\r\nGermany. He had known five thousand French occasion our recalling\r\nseventy or fourscore thousand men to look them in the face. He paid a\r\nhandsome compliment to Admiral Hawke and the navy; but said, ask the\r\nFrench whether they could not engage you hand to hand, if delivered\r\nfrom the war in Germany. The way to peace was not by lessening our\r\nefforts. England was equal to both wars, the American and the German;\r\nand if continued, nothing but conquest would follow--all owing to the\r\nGerman war. If we abandoned our allies, God would abandon us. When we\r\nhad spent a hundred millions, should we throw away the fruit, rather\r\nthan spend twelve more? Let a man so narrow-minded stand behind a\r\ncounter, and not govern a kingdom. [This was pointed at Cust, who was\r\na director of the African Company.] _America had been conquered_ in\r\n_Germany._[133] Prince Ferdinand had been the saviour of Europe, and\r\nhad shattered the whole military power of that military monarchy,\r\nFrance. It was not from what young members had said against the German\r\nwar, but from what had _not_ been said for it, that he augured ill for\r\nthis country. He hoped so insignificant a name as his would be sent\r\nto every hostile Court; though every other man in the House should be\r\nagainst the German war, he would stand single, and undergo the shame.\r\nGovernment, he hoped, would in due time lay open the proceedings of\r\nSpain, lest gentlemen might be misled from not knowing the precise\r\ntime of the arrival of Fuentes.[134] Harvey was sure Spain could not\r\nhave acted as alleged, yet owned he knew nothing of the matter. But\r\nwere people to go away, thinking he himself had courted a war with\r\nSpain? He might have declared his private opinion in council; but let\r\nParliament see the whole of the negotiation: let them know his patience\r\nand long-suffering, till he was afraid he should be answerable for it.\r\nHe gave a flat contradiction to the notion of his having courted a war\r\nwith Spain, and protested he had done all he could to avoid it. He had\r\nstated his opinion in writing, lest false whispers from those who ought\r\nto be above such underhand machinations, should prejudice him in the\r\neyes of his countrymen. In delicacy, not in obligation, he would sit\r\ndown rather than divulge what had passed. Yet altercation, opposition\r\nwould have ensued, had there not been a determination to preserve\r\nunanimity. He would even persuade gentlemen not to be too fastidious\r\nin their criticisms on the Treasury and the budget. For his relaxing\r\non the article of the fisheries, with which his friend Beckford had\r\ntaxed him, he said, it was best to own the truth; he had been overborne\r\nby numbers. He and Lord Temple would have made exclusive fisheries\r\nthe _sine quâ non_ of the peace. Were the negotiation to recommence,\r\nprovided circumstances concurred, he would stand for exclusive\r\nfisheries; nor sheath the sword till they were given up, even at the\r\nexpense of another campaign. He was going to sit down, but added a\r\nfew words on the note of Fuentes, which, said he, that minister knows\r\nwas never remitted to me. He did read me an extract; it was to the\r\neffect alleged. I did not much attend to it; said I had written to Lord\r\nBristol, and would let it rest there. He did read something like it,\r\nbut did not deliver it.\r\n\r\nThis guarded, artful, and inflammatory speech remained unanswered.\r\nGeorge Grenville, indeed, said a few words on the form of proceeding;\r\nas, that it would be precluding those great questions, to insert them\r\neither in the Speech or Address: and to justify Spain, he read a letter\r\nin which they ordered one of our cutters to be restored. As a rising\r\nminister he spoke more largely on himself, disclaimed any ambition, and\r\nprofessed he would do his duty without fear. The Address passed without\r\na negative. The next day Lord Thomond[135] and Lord Villiers moved the\r\nAddress to the Queen, and on the 19th her dowry was voted.\r\n\r\nThe secession of Pitt, and his popularity, that still kept its\r\nground, warned the administration to a closer union. At least, the\r\nold ministers, who had separated from him, thought it prudent to draw\r\nnigher to the Favourite. The Duke of Devonshire, governed by Fox,\r\nwho hated Pitt, and aspired to be lieutenant to Lord Bute, meditated\r\na coalition of the latter with Newcastle. The house of Bedford were\r\nalready devoted to the Favourite, and concurred in that connection.\r\nIn consequence of this conjunction, the Privy Seal was delivered to\r\nthe Duke of Bedford; great promises were made to Rigby. Lord Thomond,\r\nbrother-in-law of Grenville, was appointed Cofferer; Lord Powis,[136]\r\nTreasurer of the Household, and Lord George Cavendish,[137] Comptroller.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th, at night, some forty persons, or fewer, met at the St.\r\nAlban’s tavern, in Pall Mall. The Act that had granted the militia was\r\nwithin a year of expiring. It was become irksome to many of the country\r\ngentlemen, was much disliked by the chief ministers, and by great part\r\nof the House of Commons. The friends of the measure had wished to get\r\nit renewed for five years more. Some desired it perpetual. Pitt, while\r\nminister, had staved off even the shorter term. He now went to this\r\nmeeting, spoke four times warmly for the perpetuity, and said, this\r\nwas the moment to push it. Charles Townshend, who attended the meeting\r\ntoo, spoke earnestly, but only for the term of five years. The company\r\nsigned a paper, engaging to stand by one another in the measure; and\r\nthey who held commissions in the militia promised to throw them up,\r\nif the perpetuity should not be carried, agreeing only to await the\r\narrival of General Townshend, the patron of the plan, who was expected\r\nfrom the army. The Court was as much set against the militia. The Duke\r\nof Devonshire told George Grenville, he believed he could not induce\r\nhis own brothers to vote for it. The very same day intelligence had\r\nbeen received of an intended invasion from France. Grenville, told the\r\nDuke he could not come into any measure that would disband seven and\r\ntwenty thousand men, when we should have so much occasion for them: it\r\nwould be better to grant the perpetuity, and repeal it afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe same morning, Charles Townshend,[138] now Secretary at War, moved\r\nfor the land forces, which were granted without opposition. His new\r\noffice gave him an opportunity of venting his vanity. He assumed much,\r\nand called himself trustee for the honest claims of the officers. On\r\nDecember 9th, he opened to the House the state of the foreign troops\r\nin our pay, the expense of which came to near a million. Townshend\r\npleaded the inconsiderable loss we had sustained in the last campaign,\r\nnot above two thousand men, which would easily be recruited; and that\r\nnext year, as in the last four, we should cover our allies against\r\nany force France could bring against us. Should we for next year\r\ncontinue the same army, or break off abruptly? The Parliament had been\r\ncalled upon day after day to disapprove or ratify the measure; and had\r\nratified it. The totality of the war had been one of the great causes\r\nof its success. Had we neglected any other part for Germany, it had\r\nbeen fatal: but a mixed system, and attention to the whole, had given\r\nus victory in every quarter. France had resisted every where, had\r\nbeen disgraced every where. Their navy, the last sanguine promise of\r\nstill another minister, was annihilated. We ought not to desist but\r\nfrom inability to pursue up the blow. It ought to be manifest that we\r\nwere disabled. But where was a symptom of decay? In our trade, credit,\r\nagriculture, where was a failure? Yet he thought our situation nor\r\ncomfortable, nor desperate. Five millions he allowed would be expended\r\nthis year on the war in Germany. He concluded with high encomiums on\r\nwhat he called _Mr. Pitt’s divine plan_; but added, that a larger\r\nportion of fame remained for those who should take up the plan and\r\nterminate it by a good peace.\r\n\r\nThe Court, who wished to veil their eagerness for peace, and who,\r\ninstead of attaining that peace, were on the brink of a war with Spain,\r\ntook great pains to prevent their creatures from openly attacking the\r\nGerman war. Lord Egmont was persuaded to be absent from the House; but\r\nFox’s faction was more intent on discrediting Pitt than even on paying\r\ntheir court--and perhaps knew how easily they should be forgiven. Rigby\r\nsaid he had voted for all very large sums; was sorry he began to have\r\na doubt; wished an end was put--had been put to the whole war. The\r\nGermans were entitled to the protection of the House, but ours was\r\nno protection. They were in a worse condition than if conquered. The\r\ntreaty with Prussia would expire on the 12th of the month; he hoped\r\nwe should make no more such with that _little power_. Not to quit the\r\nalliance, ought only to be a condition on the party subsidized. In no\r\none treaty did there exist an article that obliged us to continue our\r\nnational troops in Germany. Nor could we supply our army with men;\r\nsince 1758, we had sent over twenty-nine thousand men. We had but\r\nthirteen thousand remaining. Could this country furnish four thousand\r\nmen a year to Germany? Marshal Ligonier had ordered the old corps to\r\nbe recruited at any rate. We had three thousand sick in hospitals, and\r\nwere reduced to send boys of ten years old--a good way to make the\r\nwar last! He spoke, he said, neither from fickleness nor discontent;\r\nwas very well contented; had tried to swallow the measure, but found\r\nit would not do. If these troops had been brought home, we might have\r\ndisbanded the militia. Wished he could see the negotiation for peace\r\nrenewed; wished even a bad peace was offered. He concluded the French\r\naccount of the rupture was authentic, or would have been contradicted.\r\nHe spoke, he said, to the country gentlemen; _they_ were not included\r\nin the picture of our _comfortable_ situation. If so much was given to\r\nglory, their cups of comfort would not be drunk so often as they used\r\nto be. Sir Robert Walpole, whom he thought the greatest minister that\r\nthis country had known, had always declared the nation could not stand\r\nunder a debt exceeding an hundred millions.\r\n\r\nStanley defended the measure of pursuing the German war, and said it\r\nwas evident from every page of the printed negotiation that France\r\nwished to get out of Germany; that she was not equal to both wars, and\r\nhad therefore neglected everything to make her push there, hoping it\r\nwould exasperate the people of England against Hanover. That none of\r\nour allies were in a situation to make conquests, and therefore we\r\nmust part with some of ours, to obtain tolerable conditions for them.\r\n\r\nGeorge Grenville supported the question solely on the foot of treaties,\r\nwhich he recapitulated, but took care to assert that he had neither\r\nadvised nor approved them; he had not been able, he said, to stop a\r\ntorrent; let those who had given the advice drink the dregs! he did not\r\ndesire to steal the fame due to another. It had not been the German\r\nwar, but the want of seamen, that had disabled France from prosecuting\r\nthe war in America and from invading England. Let us know what had been\r\nthe obstacle that had broken off the treaty. An immense load of debt\r\nhad been laid upon us; he would not call on any light of Government,\r\nwho had brought us into these distresses, to help us out of them. If\r\nthey had overlooked these things, he must be sorry. But our honour was\r\npledged, and he would not be for an ignominious peace; nor, on the\r\nother hand, would he intoxicate the people with unattainable objects.\r\nHe would not hang out our distresses; to know them was the first point;\r\nto conceal them, the second.\r\n\r\nThus were hostilities openly commenced by Grenville. He had during the\r\nlast reign avowedly or silently supported every one of Pitt’s expensive\r\nGerman measures. Indeed he had held by Pitt’s favour one of the most\r\nlucrative places under the Government, the Treasurer of the Navy. The\r\nscene was changed, and Grenville with it.\r\n\r\nPitt replied in a long speech, but with much temper, which he professed\r\nhe would keep, though so marked out; but in contempt of Grenville, he\r\naffected chiefly to answer Rigby, falling into the familiar, and not\r\nin a masterly style; desiring to expostulate, not to altercate on who\r\nwas in or out of place; but considering himself as in a council of\r\nstate, engaged to find out the point of truth, and how to wind up the\r\nwar. He complimented our troops, whom he called _the glory of human\r\nnature_, and Charles Townshend on his moderation and clear method of\r\nstating the question. If Rigby, he said, had had communication of\r\npapers, he must have seen the distresses of France, but would advise\r\nhim to reconsider his positions, before he published his political\r\ncode, before he should come _to guide_--but begged pardon for his\r\nlevity; he chose to be in good humour, for fear of being in bad. He\r\nwould not enter into the wretched consideration of what himself had\r\ndone. Grenville had treated his counsels as pernicious--nobody indeed\r\nhad asserted it--somebody did shrewdly convey it--for his part he liked\r\nbetter a man that affirmed. Grenville, however, would not entirely take\r\naway the lustre of this measure, already more than half exploded by the\r\nKing’s servants. Himself, an individual, had been called, compelled\r\nto the service; he had found this measure bound on upon the nation,\r\nboth by the concluding and breaking the treaty of Closter Severn. It\r\nwas an electoral measure, not advised, but submitted to in silence\r\nby the piety of the Duke of Cumberland. The subsidy to Prussia had\r\nbeen dictated by Hanover, not by Great Britain. Little Princes are\r\nsubsidized, when not worthy of reciprocation; but necessity had driven\r\nthat great Prince to accept our money; yet his Prussian Majesty did not\r\nthink that he thereby lost his equality of not being deserted. Both\r\nthe Empresses had received subsidies from us. He himself, he said, had\r\nresisted the measures of the closet, nor would subscribe to them till\r\nqualified. His late gracious master had suffered his representations;\r\nand he had boldly urged them, fearing our own defence and America would\r\nbe neglected; nor would he agree to the German war till every other\r\nservice had been provided for. Was it candid, was it just, to throw the\r\nwhole burthen on him, who had been but an acceder to a plan settled? an\r\nacceder to a ministry that had wanted vigour. He had _borrowed their\r\nmajority_ to carry on their own plan. He had seen where they had been\r\nright, where wrong. He had brought the American war, and taken up the\r\nGerman; had seen that we must be strong enough to baffle France, or\r\nshould do nothing. France had been _dedecorum pretiosus emptor_. It was\r\ntrue our expense had been great, and he offered himself _confitentem\r\nreum_, if he had not thereby annihilated their power both in East and\r\nWest Indies. Perhaps he had done it the wrong way; and Mr. Grenville\r\ncould have done it some other way. The business, however, was done,\r\nby whatever way done; and he would now divide the House alone against\r\nabandoning our allies. Relaxation could only invite inflexibility in\r\nour enemies; nor ought we to give the money, and at the same time\r\nblast the measure. As Germany had formerly been managed, it had been\r\na millstone about our necks; as managed now, about that of France.\r\nLet a man get possession of the Government, and act as late ministers\r\nhad acted, and he would endeavour to make his heart ache. Now we were\r\nleagued with the King of Prussia, who was born to administer military\r\nwonders to the world; his motto should be _adversis rerum immersabilis\r\nundis_. To him was added Prince Ferdinand, for whom he could not find\r\nadequate words. That great Prince had stood like a rampart to cover\r\nGermany--and at last, _comperit invidiam supremo fine domari_.\r\n\r\nLegge spoke a few words in praise of the measure, and against\r\nabandoning our allies; and the debate ended without a division.\r\n\r\nThe recapitulation of many speeches may perhaps weary the reader,\r\nbut, in equity, he must remember that at this period at least it was\r\nessential to detail them. When Mr. Pitt was driven from the management\r\nof the war, he existed as a public man; but in his speeches and past\r\nservices, his own defence of his measures was necessary from his own\r\nmouth. Libels on libels were published against him, and he wrote none.\r\nI am sensible that I do not do justice to his arguments, and less to\r\nhis eloquence; but what I give was faithfully taken from his own mouth\r\nin the House of Commons; and unless better transcripts appear, this\r\nrude sketch may be welcome to posterity. No flattery is intended to\r\nhim. When I thought him blameable, I have marked it, as will appear\r\nhereafter, with the same impartiality. The debates, too, of a free\r\nnation, arrived at the summit of its glory, may be worthy the attention\r\nof future times. Our descendants will see what their ancestors were in\r\narms and eloquence, and what liberty they enjoyed of discussing their\r\nown interests. Grant, Heaven, they may not read it with a sigh; reading\r\nit in bondage and ignominy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Pitt’s Enemies.--Debates in Parliament on the German war, and on\r\n    our Affairs with Spain.--Speeches of the leading Members.--Mr.\r\n    Pitt’s Defence of himself.--Colonel Barré’s insulting conduct to\r\n    Mr. Pitt.--Libellous Pamphlets against that Statesman, by the Rev.\r\n    Philip Francis.--Justification of Mr. Pitt’s Measures.--Family\r\n    compact between France and Spain.--Portugal invaded by Charles the\r\n    Third of Spain.--The Queen’s desire that her Brother should come\r\n    to England.--Pratt compelled to be Chief Justice of the Common\r\n    Pleas.--Lord Hardwicke and his Son.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt’s enemies did not content themselves with traducing him in\r\npamphlets and satires. A deeper blow was meditated, which, though not\r\ncarried to the extent which the projectors hoped, could not but wound\r\nhis mind, and did to a degree lower him in the opinion of some men,\r\nthough the brutality with which it was conceived and executed, raised\r\nalmost general indignation. I will just touch the surprize it wrought\r\non me, which may convey some idea of what effect it must have had on\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe report on the foreign troops was made the day after they had been\r\nremoved. Mr. Bunbury,[139] who married Lady Sarah Lenox, had spoken,\r\nfor the first time in Parliament, against the German war. Lord George\r\nSackville, with more caution, but no less hostile intention to Pitt,\r\nhad declared for the measure, as no alternative was proposed, though\r\nhe hoped ministers would concert with our allies how to draw us out of\r\nthis scrape. He did not believe that France was in a worse situation\r\nthan she had been at Gertruydenburg,[140] when she rejected insolent\r\nterms. She could, besides, subsist her troops on easier terms than we\r\ncould. She brought to account the contributions raised by her armies;\r\nhe did not know that we did. Lord George was finishing his speech as I\r\ncame into the House. My ear was struck with sounds I had little been\r\naccustomed to of late, virulent abuse on the last reign, and from a\r\nvoice unknown to me. I turned, and saw a face equally new; a black,\r\nrobust man, of a military figure, rather hard-favoured than not young,\r\nwith a peculiar distortion on one side of his face, which it seems\r\nwas owing to a bullet lodged loosely in his cheek, and which gave a\r\nsavage glare to one eye. What I less expected from his appearance, was\r\nvery classic and eloquent diction, and as determined boldness as if\r\naccustomed to harangue in that place. He told the House that in the\r\nlate King’s reign we had been governed solely by Hanoverian measures\r\nand councils; and though called to order (in truth unparliamentarily),\r\nhe proceeded with the same vociferous spirit to censure all ministers\r\nbut Lord Bute; and for Mr. Pitt, who was not present, he received\r\nthe appellation of a profligate minister, who had thrust himself\r\ninto power on the shoulders of the mob. The present King, said this\r\nnew Court-tribune, was so English, that he did not believe he had\r\nlooked into the map for Hanover;[141] and he commiserated the present\r\nministers, who were labouring through the dregs of German councils.\r\n\r\nThe reader must imagine the astonishment occasioned by this martial\r\ncensor. He was a Colonel Barré, of French extraction, born at Dublin,\r\nand had served for some years in the war in America with reputation,\r\nprosecuting his studies with assiduity in the intervals of duty. With\r\nGeneral Wolfe he had been intimately connected, both as an officer\r\nand penman; but had thought himself ill-used by Mr. Pitt, though the\r\nfriends of the latter, and Lord Barrington, lately Secretary at War,\r\nbore witness that Mr. Pitt had made it a point to serve him. In his\r\nyounger years he had acted plays with so much applause, that, it was\r\nsaid, Garrick had offered him a thousand pounds a year to come upon the\r\nstage.[142]\r\n\r\nThis man, therefore, had been selected by Lord Fitzmaurice (become Earl\r\nof Shelburne by the death of his father) as a bravo to run down Mr.\r\nPitt. Lord Shelburne held a little knot of young orators at his house;\r\nbut Barré soon overtopped them; and Fox had pushed on the project of\r\nemploying him to insult Pitt--to what extent was surmised by all the\r\nworld. The consequences will appear in the next debate.\r\n\r\nGlover,[143] the author of “Leonidas,” uttered a speech in most heroic\r\nfustian, but not without good argument, to show that all our great\r\nadvantages had been obtained before we went deeply into the German war.\r\nCharles Yorke, Attorney-General, defended the measures of the late King\r\nagainst Barré and his own friend Mauduit’s pamphlet, urging that his\r\nMajesty had reduced himself to poverty to support the war in Germany.\r\nElliot made an admirable oration to reconcile himself to consistence:\r\nowned he had opposed the treaties in 1755; and was then told they were\r\ncalculated to prevent a war in Germany. He had since been dazzled\r\nwith the national enthusiasm on the King of Prussia’s victories, and\r\nconfessed that on the like appearances he should again be led to\r\napprove the German war. It was true that war had its object, collateral\r\ndivision; but would the House wish to Germanize this young King, and\r\nmake him turn his thoughts thither more than he did? He concluded with\r\na pathetic ejaculatory wish that the peace had succeeded.\r\n\r\nOswald[144] took the same turn of endeavouring to palliate his\r\ninconsistencies; but though his parts were still shrewder and quicker\r\nthan Elliot’s, he did it much worse. Dr. Hay[145] attempted, too, an\r\napology for himself, but with the worst success of the three; and the\r\nnecessity which the principal men in Parliament found themselves under\r\nof justifying their abandoned corruption and versatility, stamped\r\ndisgrace on this Parliament itself, which it did but increase by fresh\r\nand repeated instances of servility in ensuing sessions on every change\r\nof Administration.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Dec. 11th, Mr. Cooke[146] moved for all memorials\r\nrelating to our fisheries, &c., which he introduced by saying, he\r\nwished to know what was the state of our affairs with regard to\r\nSpain--he hoped peaceable; but desired to see the papers relating to\r\ntheir claims, and to know if they had treated us with contempt and\r\ndisdain. Beckford seconded him, urging that the Gazette and Bussy’s\r\nmemorial contradicted one another. The King had asked advice of\r\nParliament: if ministers should refuse these papers, they refused to\r\ncomply with the King’s request. He did not know who were the ministers,\r\nnor whether we had a single minister, or a minister depute. It was\r\nnecessary to have _one_ minister.\r\n\r\nGrenville replied, that though he had heard of this motion, he could\r\nnot believe it would be made. It was our right to have papers, when\r\nessentially necessary; but power of negotiation belonged to the Crown;\r\nand negotiations ought not to be made public, when real mischief might\r\nbe the consequence. Had his Majesty asked advice as to Spain? would\r\nyou ground advice on those papers? or were they wanted to answer\r\nnewspapers? Should a minister or minister depute make that answer? He\r\nhad heard with surprise that _one_ man ought to direct. What had been\r\nthe constant charge against Sir Robert Walpole, but his acting as sole\r\nminister? Yet his modesty had declined the appellation. Prime Minister\r\nwas an odious title: he was sorry it was now thought an essential part\r\nof the constitution. He did believe the Gazette had contained, word\r\nfor word, the sense of the dispatch. The assurances of a peaceable\r\ndisposition had been given, but who could answer that they were to be\r\ndepended upon? It would be breach of trust to communicate the papers\r\ndemanded without particular leave; nor, should they be communicated,\r\nwould they be sufficient ground for advice. Would the House, if they\r\ncontained offensive words, lay them before the public to inflame the\r\npeople? The subject was not fit at that hour for the intervention of\r\nParliament. If ministers are called upon, and tell our distresses, they\r\nare repeated abroad: if silent, are supposed to allow them. There was\r\nno reason to suspect the King of exercising his power improperly.\r\n\r\nLord Strange said, he had not believed that any men would be so hardy\r\nas to bring on this affair, and thought they could not word it so\r\nas to obtain his assent: but the motion was now so unexceptionable,\r\nthat he could not object to it. No letters of a private nature were\r\ndemanded. The House had a right to tender its advice, even unasked.\r\nWho doubted but Spain had communicated all those papers to France?\r\nYet ministers would not produce them to Parliament. They were divided\r\namongst themselves; therefore the people ought to interpose. By showing\r\nno confidence to the people, the administration would destroy their\r\nzealous attachment to the Crown.\r\n\r\nWilkes maintained that Spain ought to be considered as hostile. Sir\r\nFrancis Dashwood said he would agree to the motion, if he saw either\r\nutility or meaning in it, but such as he would not express. Parliament,\r\nhe owned, had a right to all papers, yet Parliament had a right too\r\nto consider if there were any use in asking for them. He saw a proper\r\nanswer had been made to the memorial, and the Spanish minister had been\r\ndesired to recant--(Mr. Pitt cried out, “Where?”) Spain said to France,\r\nyou are making peace, try if you cannot obtain something for me. He had\r\nheard, he said, of no faction in the administration: he hoped there was\r\nnone any where else. Why should not confidence be placed in the King\r\nand administration, till it was abused? There might be something in the\r\npapers which Spain would not like the City of London should know--yet\r\nhe supposed there was not more than appeared. Was it wished to\r\naddress the Crown to declare war? But that was the prerogative of the\r\nCrown. Spain, too, would probably think twice before she embarked in\r\nhostilities. There might be different opinions in the council of Spain.\r\nThat secret we were bound in honour to keep.\r\n\r\nLord Frederick Campbell[147] said, he did not believe there were any\r\nfactions in the ministry; if there were, the King would put an end to\r\nthem: but if the administration were distracted, this measure would\r\ndistract them much more. He had great hopes that these ill appearances\r\nwould end in peace. Nugent[148] lamented there being any divisions,\r\nas unanimity was never more necessary. Bamber Gascoyne said, if any\r\nof the papers were of too secret a nature, a secret committee might\r\nbe appointed to examine them. _By destroying parties, we had created\r\nfactions._[149] He himself had never been in a minister’s house, nor\r\never intended it.[150] The conduct of this _patriot_ will appear\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nSir John Glynn said, that that time twenty years had been famous for\r\ncalling for papers; with intention then to condemn a minister; now it\r\nwas with a view to applauding one. A paper had been produced at that\r\ntime which the King of Prussia never forgave. Himself had never seen\r\nany benefit arise from motions of that sort. Rigby said, he should\r\nbe sorry if that motion were likely to be complied with; but that\r\ndid not seem very probable. But what? had the City instructed its\r\nrepresentatives to demand a First Minister? He had heard the Excise\r\nadopted by a sort of First Minister. He would tell the House who were\r\nthe Administration; the two Secretaries of State, the Chancellor,\r\nthe President, &c., and in their deliberations there had been twelve\r\nagainst two; proof enough of union. The other House had a right to\r\njudge as well as the Commons; and was the natural barrier between the\r\nCrown and people. Whoever sought the Administration, might find them\r\nin the Duke of Cumberland’s late lodgings at St. James’s (where the\r\ncouncils were held). At a time when not a man whispered to his friend,\r\nbut in commendation of the King, would the House wish to set a First\r\nMinister over him?\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt expressed much concern at the flame that had arisen, and that\r\nthe House, by losing its temper, had lost its reason, and degenerated\r\ninto barbarism. His friend Beckford, he feared had thought more of him\r\nthan he had done of himself; but the word _guide_, commented as it\r\nhad been, had misled him. If the present question tended to make one\r\nindividual minister, he should be against it; but when he looked at\r\nthe complexion of the House, he had no such apprehension. Censured as\r\nhe had been for using an expression so much condemned, he could not\r\nfind reason to retract it. Lord Egremont, he believed, would not hold\r\nthe Seals an hour, if not permitted to guide his own correspondence.\r\nThus, he himself, who he hoped had not lessened his country, had\r\ninsisted on the same right. In the Treasury, in the Military, in the\r\nNavy, he had never assumed or claimed any direction: had never spoken\r\nto the King on those heads, but had always applied to the ministers\r\nof those several departments; had transmitted everything through the\r\nchannels of each office. He hoped, he said, to have these egotisms\r\npardoned; he would now come to the question in agitation with a temper\r\nthat nothing could ruffle. Even the virtues of the King, on which the\r\nHouse had been so much advised to rely, must be a little the fruit of\r\ntime; hoped his Majesty would be aided by wholesome and deep-sighted\r\nadvice. From the present motion what mischief could arise? he wished\r\nsome necessity had made him absent--but would it be decorous in him to\r\nbe shy? in a House where, he believed, he did not stand too well? He\r\nbelieved the _bottom of the bottom_ of this affair would be dangerous;\r\nnot so, while confined to memorials. Spain had made three demands in\r\na most extensive manner; the right of fishery, which he had said he\r\nwould as soon give up the Tower of London, as grant; nor would the\r\nKing, he was sure, accord it; himself had never been ordered to hold\r\nany other language. But why, might it be said, call for these papers?\r\nbecause, if you temporized, or let Spain think you temporized, she\r\nwould more assuredly push her claims. Suspense might be wholesome, if\r\nthey were prepared, and you were not. The contrary being true, contrary\r\nmeasures should be pursued. Himself would not press the motion, if told\r\nby authority that it was premature; but then let the ministers say\r\nso, and mark the era, without moulting a feather of England’s crest.\r\nThe note in the memorial, said to be delivered, was no departure from\r\ntheir demands. Did they even say they would not impede the peace on\r\nthe consideration of these demands? Let ministers declare this, and he\r\nwould second to withdraw the motion--but he saw, he said, he should\r\nnot be told so. Or had France given up her insulting menace, that\r\nshe would stand by the demands of Spain? This was the Gordian knot,\r\nthat he himself had not been able to cut; had feared it would rise\r\nin judgment against him; hoped it would not against any other man.\r\nDivisions had always existed; when were twelve men cast in the same\r\nmould? Divisions were sometimes salutary. Queen Elizabeth had promoted\r\nthem in her Councils. When he left administration, had never seen such\r\nunanimity; he had said in high place, that his consolation was, to\r\nleave such men in power; and had declared that he would only oppose\r\nwhat he would have opposed with the Seals in his hand--but to have\r\nstayed and have done that, would only have been prejudicial. It was the\r\nextent of Spain’s claims that had shocked him, not her lofty idioms,\r\nthe most insignificant of all things. Whoever should cede to them but a\r\ncockboat, ceded all. But the very present debate would strengthen the\r\nKing’s hands. He then made an encomium on the diligence, activity,\r\nand punctuality of the Earl of Bristol. Should the fisheries not be\r\nsettled, the man who should give them up would one day or other be\r\nimpeached. For himself he wished he had not been so much in the right;\r\n_wished he had not known so much as he did_. What he did know was\r\nburied in the centre of the earth. France had told us with good faith,\r\nthat if we did not make up with Spain, they would break off the Treaty\r\nwith us. If Spain declared war, he should think her _felo de se_. It\r\nwould not be equal imprudence in her to abet France. Could the House\r\nproportion its supplies without knowing in what predicament Spain stood\r\nwith France? Should the former declare war, she could lend money to\r\nthe latter. The revenues of Spain were under five millions, and she\r\nemployed seventy thousand men to collect them, besides twenty thousand\r\nthat were engaged in the affair of tobacco. Was this a formidable\r\nenemy? To him it was indifferent to derive justification from this\r\nsituation of things; should he prove to have been in the wrong, he\r\nshould comfort himself with having thought he was right. All foreign\r\nCourts, especially Spain, would think the present motion wise. Were\r\nhe not limited, or self-limited, he could enforce his arguments with\r\nmore strength. The Gazette had been printed to persuade eight millions\r\nof people that Spain was amicable; but if there were indisputable\r\nproofs to the contrary, it was deceiving all the world. It was of no\r\nconsequence to establish on which side lay truth; Bussy’s memorial had\r\nproved the connection between the two houses of Bourbon. Should the\r\nevent end in a rupture, we had lost our opportunity--if affairs were in\r\naccommodation, would the honour of England be preserved? Would Spain\r\nbe obliged to England who bowed, or to France, who should extort from\r\nus, in the height of our conquests, advantages for Spain?\r\n\r\nColonel Barré, whether (as he gave out afterwards) to show that he had\r\nnot taken advantage of Mr. Pitt’s absence to abuse him the day before,\r\nor whether (as is more probable) to pursue the point to which he had\r\nbeen instigated, rose, and renewed the attack with redoubled acrimony.\r\nInsult of language, terms, manner, were addressed, and personally\r\naddressed, to Mr. Pitt, by that bravo. His variations, inconsistencies,\r\narts, popularity, ambition, were all pressed upon Pitt with energy and\r\nbitterness, and the whole apostrophe wore the air of an affront more\r\nthan of a philippic. He told the House he could not amuse, but he would\r\nnot deceive them. That the disagreeable posture of our affairs with\r\nSpain was solely owing to the late resignation, which had thrown our\r\ncouncils and the nation itself into distraction. That Mr. Pitt, though\r\nprofessing it, had no confidence in the King himself. Here Pitt, who\r\nhad remained in astonishment at so bold and novel an attack from a new\r\nspeaker, called him to order, declaring that no word guilty of so foul\r\na crime as want of confidence in the King had fallen from him, and sat\r\ndown, leaving Barré to proceed in his invective; but the latter was\r\ninterrupted by Fox, who said the King’s name was never to be mentioned\r\nin a debate; that the House had listened with pleasure while justice\r\nwas done to his Majesty’s virtues; that Colonel Barré had a right to\r\nshow to what he thought Mr. Pitt’s arguments had tended; and that he\r\nchose to give the former this hint, because he seemed so able and\r\nwilling to make use of his right. Charles Yorke said the King’s name\r\ncould not be used to influence debate. Pitt said he had referred to the\r\nKing’s speech, because it asked advice of the House. Fox, still fearing\r\nlest the interruption and ignorance of the forms of the House should\r\ndisconcert Barré, replied, that the speech might be quoted, because\r\nit is always understood as the speech of the minister. Barré went on,\r\nsaying, that if any man opposed, and not from the truest reasons, he\r\nwould wish him to be silent. Should there be a man whose whole life\r\nhad been a contradiction and a series of popular arts, he would judge\r\nhim from his actions, not from his words. Beckford called to have\r\nthe question read, to prevent such deviation into personality. Rigby\r\ninsisted that Beckford always deviated more than Barré had done. Barré\r\nadded, that he had less reason to deviate than Beckford, not allowing\r\nhimself to be so distracted; and that his front was not broad enough\r\nto write contradiction on; nor would he desert the King’s service when\r\nmost wanted.\r\n\r\nPitt made no manner of reply; only turning to Beckford, and asking\r\npretty loud, “how far the scalping Indians cast their tomahawks?” It\r\nseemed to some a want of spirit, but it was evident by the indignation\r\nof the House, that such savage war was detested: and Pitt perhaps\r\ndid not care to put them in mind how far himself had often pushed\r\ninvective; nor chose to risk their preferring the new master of abuse\r\nto the old. It had not been unwise, it should seem, to have uttered a\r\nfew words, stating to Barré the indecence of treating an infirm and\r\nmuch older man with such licence, showing him that insult could not be\r\nresented when offered in a public assembly, who always interpose, and\r\nputting both him and the audience in mind, that a man, who had gained\r\nthe hearts of his countrymen by his services, could only forfeit them\r\nby his own conduct, and not by the railing of a private individual.\r\nWith the public this outrage did Mr. Pitt no injury. Barré was abhorred\r\nas a barbarian irregular, and Fox, who had lent such kind assistance\r\nto a ruffian, drew the chief odium on himself. Charles Townshend,\r\nbeing asked soon after, when the House would rise for the holidays,\r\nreplied,[151] “I do not know; but when it does, the roads will be as\r\ndangerous as if the army were disbanded.” And Barré having said that\r\nhe would not answer for his head, but would for his heart, “Yes,” said\r\nGeorge Selwyn,[152] “if he could not, the former would have been broken\r\nlong ago.”\r\n\r\nThe debate was terminated by Lord George Sackville and Elliot;\r\nthe latter pleading against producing papers in the height of a\r\nnegotiation; and adding, “perhaps an express is now on the road from\r\nSpain determined for war.” The motion was rejected without a division,\r\nscarcely six voices being given for the question. Not one Tory spoke in\r\nthe debate but Sir John Glynn, and he declared against Pitt. The next\r\ntime Barré went to Court, the King took most gracious notice of him.\r\n\r\nThe City of Dublin addressed Mr. Pitt on his resignation. The same was\r\nproposed at Lynn, and rejected; and at Leicester such a motion was\r\nstopped by a person producing and reading a libel called _Mr. Pitt’s\r\nLetter versified_. It was done by Francis,[153] a clergyman attached\r\nto Lord Holland, who supplied the notes. Another, by the same hand,\r\ncalled _A Letter from the anonymous Author of the Letters versified_,\r\nwas published, reviling Mr. Pitt on bearing Barré’s ill-usage. Lord\r\nMelcomb, at Lord Bute’s table, constantly held the same language.\r\n\r\nThese specks were soon effaced in the confusion that fell on the\r\nministers themselves, and by the justification, which, in spite of\r\nthem, burst forth of Mr. Pitt’s measures. The war which they had\r\nso poorly attempted to ward off, broke upon them, when they had no\r\nlonger his assistance. A courier arrived on the 24th from Spain, with\r\na refusal of showing us their treaty with France. This treaty was\r\nthe famous _Family Compact_, to which even the House of Austria had\r\nacceded, of which Mr. Pitt, by a masterpiece of intelligence, had\r\ngot notice,[154] and of which our dastardly ministers had hoped to\r\ndeprecate the effects by pusillanimous palliatives and submission:\r\na compact formed because we were become so formidable, and the very\r\nsignature of which had terrified Lord Bute and his associates into\r\ndeparting at once from our superiority. This was the secret at which\r\nMr. Pitt had so often hinted, and which he had now the satisfaction\r\nof hearing published by the mouths of his enemies. We had avoided\r\nthe interception of the Spanish fleet, as Mr. Pitt had earnestly\r\nrecommended. It was now arrived, and they temporized no longer. Fuentes\r\nwas recalled, and Lord Bristol was consequently forced to return.\r\nPrevious to his departure Fuentes delivered a memorial to the foreign\r\nministers, in which Mr. Pitt was arraigned by name; an honour almost\r\nunheard of. Alberoni had been accused by George the First; but though\r\nthat precedent was not flattering, Mr. Pitt could want no vindication,\r\nwhen the Court of Spain, and Barré, the tool of Lord Bute, conspired to\r\ncharge him with being author of the war.\r\n\r\n_We_ had been the _willing_ dupes of the Spanish House of Bourbon. It\r\nwas a more horrid insult on all good faith--on humanity--on ties of\r\nblood, that Spain summoned Portugal to declare against us. The ruins of\r\nLisbon were almost smoking yet! The Queen of Portugal was the Spanish\r\nMonarch’s sister; her husband and children were dwelling in tents at a\r\ndistance from their late capital. Assassination and conspiracies had\r\nbeset the Throne. This was the moment that Charles the Third selected\r\nto invade their kingdom! France, it was said, in vain dissuaded this\r\nperfidy--not from delicacy; but the meditated conquest of Portugal\r\nwas likely to engross the whole attention of the Court of Madrid. If\r\nwe should support Portugal, it might be a division of our forces; but\r\nFrance needed all the assistance Spain could lend. Timber was wholly\r\nexhausted in France. She had sent even to Dalmatia, and to little\r\npurpose. The expense of ship-building is far greater in France than in\r\nEngland. Her cities and trading companies set themselves to building\r\nships and presenting them to the King, but this was a distant and slow\r\nresource.\r\n\r\nThe Queen, who bore great affection to her brothers, was desirous that\r\nthe second, Prince Charles of Mecklenburgh, should come over. The King\r\nwould not venture to propose it to Lord Bute, but wrote to him, and\r\nafter a reluctance of a fortnight on the part of the Favourite, the\r\nboon was granted.\r\n\r\nThe ministers were solicitous to remove Pratt[155] from the House of\r\nCommons, and offered him the dignity of Chief Justice of the Common\r\nPleas. He demurred; but was forced to accept it, for they would not\r\nonly have removed him from being Attorney-General, a post that required\r\na more pliant officer, and which he was willing to give up; but they\r\nhad the injustice to refuse him his gown as King’s counsel, and he\r\nmust have pleaded below the bar, or have quitted his profession. Mr.\r\nYorke was made Attorney, and Norton, Solicitor Generals. This enforced\r\ndestination of Pratt to be Chief Justice, preserved the Constitution\r\nafterwards from the same men, whose policy exerted such rigour against\r\nhim. Mr. Yorke had lost the precedence over Pratt when the latter was\r\nmade Attorney-General. It was on the coalition of Mr. Pitt, after the\r\naffair of Minorca, with the Duke of Newcastle and Lord Hardwicke. Pitt\r\nthen offered to restore Lord Anson to the lead at the Admiralty, or to\r\nmake Yorke Attorney, but would not grant both. Lord Hardwicke preferred\r\nhis son-in-law to his son; a partiality which the latter, whose eye was\r\nfixed on the Great Seal, and which, by these means, Pratt afterwards\r\nobtained to his prejudice, never forgave to his father.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n  Fuentes, the Spanish Ambassador, quits England.--Return of Lord\r\n    Bristol from Madrid.--War declared against Spain.--Projects\r\n    of Lord Bute, Mr. Fox, and the Duke of Cumberland.--The Duke\r\n    of Bedford.--Mr. Pitt’s influence with the Nation.--Divisions\r\n    in the Council respecting the War with Spain.--Expedition to\r\n    the Havannah.--Meeting of Parliament.--Lord Bute’s harangue.--\r\n    Mr. Pitt’s Speech in the House of Commons.--Rigby’s attempt to\r\n    show the inutility of our Conquests.--Other Speakers in the\r\n    Debate.--Pacific Disposition of the new Czar.--Court Intrigues\r\n    in France against Marshal Broglio and his Brother.--Prejudices\r\n    and resentments of the Tories.--Preponderating Influence and\r\n    Haughtiness of Lord Bute.--The Duke of York’s contempt of Lord\r\n    Bute and the Scotch.--Proceedings in the Parliament of Ireland.--\r\n    Lord Halifax.--William Gerard Hamilton.--Bill for continuing the\r\n    Militia.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the first day of the year Fuentes, the Spanish ambassador, quitted\r\nEngland, and was received at Calais, and all the way to Paris, with\r\ndistinguished honours, as the saviour of France. He was a dull cold\r\nman, and wedded to all the weakness of his religion.[156] Lord\r\nBristol,[157] a very Spaniard too in formality and pride, was recalled\r\nat the same time. His abilities had never been esteemed, and were now\r\nmuch called in question; but the publication of his negotiations did\r\nhim much honour. Though he stooped to be the tool of Mr. Pitt, he\r\nhad not disliked to receive instructions that authorized him to be\r\nimperious. His very parsimony gave way to any ostentation about his own\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nOn the second, the King, in full council, declared his resolution of\r\nmaking war on Spain: for the ministers, who had driven out Mr. Pitt,\r\nrather than embrace this necessary measure, were reduced to adopt it\r\nat the expense of vindicating him and condemning themselves; and,\r\nwhat was worse to the nation than their shame, had not him, nor his\r\nspirit, to conduct them. Nor yet were they unanimous on this point,\r\nor on any other part of the war. Lord Bute’s object was, peace at any\r\nrate, that he might pursue his plans of power at home. Fox aimed at\r\nthe destruction of Pitt, and at favour with and through the Favourite,\r\nto which he sacrificed his views of wealth, as Paymaster, in the\r\nGerman war. The Duke of Cumberland, who was now rather openly, than\r\nconfidentially, consulted, was inclined to support the German war;\r\neither from partiality to the Electorate, or hoping to command there\r\nin the room of Prince Ferdinand. His Royal Highness was reconciled to\r\nthe Duke of Newcastle, who, to please the Duke and Lady Yarmouth,[158]\r\nfluctuated again towards the war in Germany, though he could not lead\r\nback his friend Lord Hardwicke[159] to that side. The bias too had been\r\ntoo strongly given to the Duke of Bedford, who declared he would move\r\nin Parliament to recall our troops from Germany. Lord Bute, fearing\r\nthe Duke would gain too great popularity by this conduct, and inclined\r\nenough to heap any mortifications on the King of Prussia and the House\r\nof Brunswick, took the same side; but was persuaded, as the money was\r\nalready voted and the contracts made, to suffer the troops to make one\r\nmore campaign there. The Duke of Bedford was assured by the King, that\r\nmeasures would be taken for recalling the troops, without recurring to\r\nthe authority of Parliament. Yet so much did they dread the effects\r\nof Mr. Pitt’s influence with the nation, and of their own unpopular\r\nmeasures, that they agreed to give the King of Prussia his subsidy\r\nfor another year, but would not renew the treaty with him, which now\r\nexpired.\r\n\r\nThey were still more divided and embarrassed on the war with Spain.\r\nUnavoidable as it was, the Dukes of Newcastle and Bedford, Lord\r\nHardwicke and Lord Mansfield,[160] were against engaging in it; and\r\nHardwicke, when the affirmative was decided, declared he would return\r\nno more to Council. But Lord Bute, Lord Granville,[161] Lord Egremont,\r\nGeorge Grenville, and, I think, Lord Ligonier, prevailed for the\r\ndeclaration of war. Lord Anson[162] was ill, and the Duke of Devonshire\r\nout of town.\r\n\r\nYet, though the war with Spain was a popular measure, the City and the\r\ncountry had so mean an opinion of those who were to direct it, that the\r\nstocks immediately fell to 66½, though in the Rebellion they had never\r\nbeen lower than 72. The declaration from Spain luckily arrived three\r\ndays after the first subscription on the new loan had been paid--yet it\r\nsunk four per cent.--three days sooner, and it would not have been paid\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th, war was declared. The next day came news of the reduction\r\nof Colberg, almost the last hope of the King of Prussia. Nor yet\r\nwere the Ministers ready to decide, whether they would blow up the\r\nfortifications of Belleisle and abandon it, or whether they should\r\nundertake to support Portugal. They determined first to send Lord\r\nTyrawley[163] thither, while Lord Albemarle[164] kissed the King’s hand\r\nfor the command of the expedition, which was so often set forth and so\r\noften countermanded, and which at last laboured to sea. It was to take\r\nup troops at Martinico, and thence sail to attack the Havannah.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th the Parliament met, and the King acquainted both Houses\r\nwith the new war he had undertaken; a ceremonial decorated by the\r\nFavourite himself, who, as if he had wrenched the thunderbolt out of\r\nMr. Pitt’s hands only to wield it himself with mightier vigour, now\r\nharangued the Parliament for the first time. Every preparative of pomp,\r\nattitude, and lofty language were called in to make him worthy of\r\nhimself. His admirers were in ecstacies; the few that dared to sneer\r\nat his theatric fustian, did not find it quite so ridiculous as they\r\nwished. It was enough for the former that their god was not dumb, and\r\nthere was no danger that he would familiarize himself too often with\r\nthe multitude. He affected to adopt parliamentary measures, and to\r\nwish that all the negotiations with Spain might be laid before them;\r\ngraciously promising to beseech the King that not only papers might\r\nbe produced, but that the Cabinet-councillors themselves might be\r\npermitted to divulge the opinions they had given. This was a puny piece\r\nof chicane, the Ministers endeavouring to prove that the hostilities\r\nof Spain were subsequent in date to the period in which Mr. Pitt found\r\nit advisable from their conduct to attack the Spaniards. He had early\r\ndetected their league with France, and was not of a humour to weigh\r\ndates against facts, or memorials against combinations. Nor Hardwicke’s\r\nforms nor Mansfield’s subtleties could persuade the seeing part of\r\nmankind that a war at our doors ought to be treated with the same\r\nliteral circumspection as an action of trespass or battery at common\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt himself, in the House of Commons, with much seeming modesty,\r\nassumed the honour that was due to his intelligence and foresight;\r\nand by disclaiming any triumph on the necessity into which the\r\nministers had fallen of making war, asserted the right, to which his\r\ncounsels had entitled him, of having pointed out the moment when\r\nthe war ought to have commenced--a moment, lost by his enemies,\r\nwithout the benefit of having warded off the war with Spain. Lord\r\nNorth,[165] who seconded the address of thanks for the King’s speech,\r\nhad injudiciously furnished Pitt with an opportunity of vindicating\r\nhis measures, calling him an abdicated minister, and violently taxing\r\nhim with a fondness for new hostilities. Nothing could be more cool\r\nor artful than Pitt’s reply. It was all panegyric; all gratitude for\r\nhis Majesty’s resentment of Spain’s provoking conduct, and for the\r\n_caution_ with which he promised to engage in so large a war. In his\r\nown particular situation, he might be supposed not to like such firm,\r\nand yet such _cautious_ measures--but he did; he heartily thanked the\r\nministers for their _caution_; and meaned to conciliate unanimity,\r\nwhich he hoped would spread from one end of the island to the other.\r\nHimself for five years had laboured successfully--but he did not mean\r\nto pride himself that way--yet he had proved not to have been so much\r\nin the wrong as his enemies had thought; and, however Lord North had\r\ndisparaged his intelligence, activity, and discernment, he hoped his\r\nsuccessors would not be endowed with worse or less; and that the\r\npeople would place confidence in the administration, whose large and\r\nwide-spread connections must be followed by confidence and favour. A\r\npoor individual like himself could have no such favour and following!\r\nHe should easily have been blamed, if any slip had appeared in his\r\nconduct. _Now_ it must be the King--it must be the Administration,\r\nthe Parliament, nation, army, and navy, who were to carry on the war;\r\nand he prayed to God it might all be enough! Yet he thought us equal\r\nto the whole. However, he had not sought the Spanish war; and if it\r\nwere not too much for a poor individual, _for an abdicated Minister_,\r\nto say, he hoped it would appear, that for five years together he had\r\nmade much political court to Spain, and great persons had concurred\r\nwith him in those counsels. The sacrifices he had offered would show\r\nhow much he and they had been in the right; and that he had not been\r\nso haughty as was represented in rejecting Bussy’s memorial. He would\r\nnever call for the papers which would exemplify the temper he had used\r\ntowards Spain. If his Majesty should think they would satisfy the\r\nnation, would satisfy Europe, he knew he should appear to have had the\r\nunanimous approbation of the whole Cabinet to several of the papers\r\nhe had sent to Spain. But what imported it what one man or another\r\nhad thought three months before? Since that era he had received such\r\npublic marks of Royal approbation, together with a pension and peerage\r\n(for his wife), as few individuals could boast. The moment was come\r\nwhen every man ought to _show himself_ for the whole. I do, said he,\r\ncruelly as I have been treated in pamphlets and libels. Arm the whole!\r\nBe one people! This war, though it has cut deep into our pecuniary,\r\nhad augmented our military faculties. Set that against the debt,\r\nthat spirit which has made us what we are. Forget everything but the\r\npublic!--for the public I forget both my wrongs and my infirmities.\r\n\r\nGrenville told him he would have his wish: orders were given for laying\r\nbefore the House all the papers from the time of Bussy’s memorial. “I\r\nhave no wish for their coming,” replied Pitt, “If for the benefit of\r\nhis Majesty’s affairs, let them come; and if they do come, shall it be\r\nwith no farther retrospect than Bussy’s memorial? How condescending is\r\nthe boon! how futile! how unsatisfactory!”\r\n\r\nYet notwithstanding their affected alacrity for war on this occasion,\r\nthe new Ministers took every opportunity of raising disgust in the\r\nnation against the late measures. Rigby, at the instigation of Fox,\r\nmoved that Colonel Boyd should lay before the House of Commons the\r\nmuster-roll of the Hessians, on whom he threw out many reflections,\r\nand affirmed that 9000 men were wanting out of the 22,000 which they\r\nought to furnish. He said the muster-rolls of our mercenaries were not\r\nreturned to the office of the Secretary at War; and complained that not\r\na single order was gone to recruit the army in Germany, which ought\r\nto amount to 96,000 men. He hoped Prince Ferdinand would be allowed\r\nto give no more orders to British troops. He pretended to approve the\r\ndeclaration against Spain, but then endeavoured to show that we were\r\nunequal to a new war. It required, he said, 38,000 men to garrison our\r\nconquests; and yet those garrisons fell short by 11,000 men. Belleisle\r\nalone had cost near half a million; yet what did it furnish but sprats\r\nand little cows? Canada gave us only furs; yet hats were not become\r\ncheaper; nor were sugar or rum fallen by the acquisition of _opulent_\r\nGuadaloupe; nor negroes by the conquest of Goree; gum was the only\r\ncommodity reduced. For Louisbourg, he hoped the fortifications would\r\nbe blown up. The enemy was hurt, but were we enriched, except from\r\nthe successes in the East Indies? He wished, in short, not to keep\r\nour conquests, and to put an end to a ruinous war, in which we had no\r\nallies but mercenaries.\r\n\r\nCharles Townshend took the same key, and said it had been fortunate, if\r\nour apprehension of Spain had driven us to make peace with France. He\r\nfeared we should sink from a dream of ambition to a state of bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nStanley maintained that France had been in earnest in the negotiation,\r\nbut had been buoyed up by the ambition and revenge of Spain. Was France\r\nso weak, and yet not in earnest? The object of his own labours had been\r\nto keep France divided from Spain, and with that view England had\r\noffered to yield more than she had asked in return. This was a strong\r\nvindication of Mr. Pitt’s conduct, and from a competent witness.\r\n\r\nGrenville, in answer to Beckford, said, he would pawn his life that no\r\nassurances had been given to the City that there would be no Spanish\r\nwar. Thomas Walpole[166] replied, that he had never been told from the\r\nTreasury that there would not be war with Spain; yet he would say, that\r\nhad the City apprehended it, they would not have lent their money so\r\neasily. The Hessian papers were ordered to lie on the table.\r\n\r\nIn prosecution of the same hostilities to Pitt, the Duke of Bedford,\r\nresisting the most earnest entreaties of the Duke of Cumberland, and\r\neven without the approbation of the Court, determined to make his\r\nmotion, which, however, he softened from a proposal of recalling the\r\ntroops from Germany, into a resolution of the ruinous impracticability\r\nof carrying on the war. He might as decently have termed it an\r\nexhortation to Spain not to dread our arms. Lord Bute, to show the\r\nCourt did not countenance so gross a measure, moved the previous\r\nquestion, and was supported by Newcastle, Melcomb, and Denbigh. Lord\r\nTemple of course opposed the Duke of Bedford. The Lords Shelburne,\r\nPomfret, and Talbot spoke for the motion; but the previous question was\r\ncarried by 105 to 16, which latter were the friends of Bedford and Fox.\r\nSix or seven even protested.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the debate Lord Bute dropped hints of important good\r\nnews, which he had received that very morning. It was supposed to mean\r\nthe pacific disposition of the new Czar. Elizabeth, his aunt, was just\r\ndead, and Peter the Third had mounted the Russian throne. So far from\r\ninheriting her animosity to the King of Prussia, the young Emperor was\r\nhis enthusiastic admirer, and more likely to war under his banners than\r\nto continue to overwhelm him with torrents of barbarians.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Bedford receiving such a rebuff from the Lords, the\r\nfaction dropped the design of renewing the motion in the Commons, the\r\nconsequence having been a side-wind of approbation to Mr. Pitt, and\r\nalmost applause to Lord Bute for taking up the military spirit--an\r\napprobation the latter did not wish to receive, nor intend to merit.\r\nHowever, 5000 men were ordered for Portugal, and the command destined\r\nto Lord Tyrawley. Lord Albemarle too, and his brothers, Commodore and\r\nColonel Keppel,[167] set out for Portsmouth on the expedition to the\r\nHavannah; but they did not sail till the beginning of March. Lord\r\nTyrawley went to Lisbon at the same time, whither M. Dunn, or Odunn,\r\nwho had married a daughter of Parsons,[168] a famous Jacobite alderman\r\nin the last reign, was dispatched from Versailles to traverse his\r\nnegotiations.\r\n\r\nDr. Osbaldiston,[169] the aged Bishop of Carlisle, was translated to\r\nthe See of London, on the death of Bishop Hayter; and was succeeded by\r\nLyttelton,[170] Dean of Exeter.\r\n\r\nIn France, Marshal Broglio, and his brother, the Count, were\r\ndisgraced by Court intrigues. They were the best, and almost only\r\nsuccessful officers in the French service. The marshal[171] was a mere\r\ndisciplinarian, of no parts. The Count[172] was lively, and earnest to\r\ninform himself; and by being quicker than his brother, with not much\r\nbetter parts, was only more likely to be in the wrong: but they were\r\nboth men of strict honour. Having presented a memorial against the\r\nPrince of Soubize, in which they attacked Stainville, brother of the\r\nDuke of Choiseul, the latter, who possessed the favour of Madame de\r\nPompadour, procured the marshal and his brother to be banished to their\r\ncountry-seats.\r\n\r\nThe Tories, triumphing in the partiality of the Court, and rather\r\noffended than alarmed at the jealousy with which they were beheld by\r\nthe Whigs, who in power, property, and credit were beyond comparison\r\nthe preponderating part of the nation, took every occasion of\r\ndisplaying their old prejudices and resentments. On every contested\r\nelection they acted in a body against the old Whigs, or later converts,\r\nhowever attached to the Court. Thus they exerted all their interest\r\nagainst Lord Gower[173] and Lord Orford[174] on election-causes, and\r\nagainst the Duke of Bridgwater[175] and Lord Strange, on a bill for\r\na new northern navigation--points, on every one of which the Tories\r\nwere rancorous and unsuccessful. Nor was Scotland wiser. One Haldane\r\nhad stood for Bridport, lost it, and petitioned. Sir Henry Erskine,\r\na creature of the Favourite, had the indecency and folly to call the\r\nEnglish party in the House of Commons _a profligate majority_; an\r\noffence not forgotten, though the Scots were beaten by three to one.\r\nThe inconsiderable number that in either House of Parliament adhered\r\nto Mr. Pitt, and the almost universal acquiescence to the Favourite’s\r\ninfluence, persuaded both him and his dependents, that they had but to\r\ngive the tone, and prerogative would master all opposition. Nor did\r\nhis partisans do more than was practised by the Favourite himself. If\r\nthey insulted the nation, he ruled the Court with a rod of iron. The\r\nQueen, her brother, and the brothers of the King, were taught to feel\r\ntheir total want of credit. The Duke of York, as Lord Anson was dying,\r\nambitioned the post of Lord High Admiral, but did not dare even to ask\r\nit. Prince William,[176] the favourite brother of the King, wished\r\nalso to be employed abroad, and ordered Legrand,[177] his governor, to\r\nsolicit Lord Bute for a command. The haughty Earl treated Legrand with\r\nscurrilous language for putting such things into the Prince’s head. The\r\nDuke of York, who, though the elder, was by far the more indiscreet of\r\nthe brothers, openly expressed his resentment and contempt of Lord Bute\r\nand the Scotch; and as a mark of disobedience, went to a hunting party\r\nat the Duke of Richmond’s, to which he had been invited with the Prince\r\nof Mecklenburg; but the latter was not suffered to go to a disaffected\r\nhouse in disaffected company.\r\n\r\nBut while inactivity reigned in the Parliament of England, that of\r\nIreland was not idle. Lord Halifax,[178] their new Lord-Lieutenant,\r\nwas, like most of his predecessors very popular at first. They voted\r\nhim an additional salary of four thousand pounds a year. He had the\r\ndecency, though very necessitous, not to accept it for himself, but\r\ndesired it might be settled on his successors. The House of Commons,\r\nhowever, would not wait till it should take place, to pay themselves,\r\nbut passed a vote to make their Parliaments, which existed during the\r\nlife of each King, septennial. The party attached to the Castle[179]\r\nvoted for it, concluding it would be thrown out by the Lords. The\r\nLords, as provident for their popularity, thinking it would be rejected\r\nin England, passed it likewise. It was rejected here, but not without\r\nmuch disposition in some of the Council to have it granted. Lord\r\nHilsborough,[180] who had great weight with Lord Halifax, stayed with\r\nhim in Dublin, and openly made war on the Primate;[181] while William\r\nGerard Hamilton,[182] the Secretary, gained such applause in that\r\nParliament, that a motion for augmenting the troops was carried by the\r\nsole power of his eloquence.\r\n\r\nMarch 19th, the bill for continuing the militia for seven years was\r\npassed by the House of Commons in England; and the counties, that had\r\nnot raised theirs, were ordered to pay five pounds a man. This was\r\nsettled by a compromise, lest a longer term should be insisted on. Its\r\nown friends were sick of it, and had clogged it with many clauses, in\r\nhopes it would be rejected by their opponents. But the Ministers would\r\nnot risk the unpopularity of a negative, and were even afraid to part\r\nwith so large a body of men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n  Conquest of Martinico.--War in Portugal.--Lord Tyrawley.--\r\n    Count la Lippe.--The Cock-Lane Ghost.--Pacific disposition\r\n    of the new Czar.--His Popular Measures.--Count Schouvalow.--\r\n    Meditated War with Denmark by the Czar and the King of Prussia.--\r\n    Insurrections in Ireland, quelled by the Earl of Hertford.--Lord\r\n    Bute’s Ambition.--The Duke of Newcastle.--His friends.--The\r\n    Portuguese War, and the War in Germany.--The Duke of Bedford.--\r\n    Fox’s Observation to Walpole.--Lords Mansfield, Hardwicke, and\r\n    Lincoln.--Newcastle’s tenacity of Power.--Creation of seven new\r\n    Peers.--Private negotiation with the Court of Vienna.--The new\r\n    Peers.--Buckingham House purchased by the Queen.--Seclusion of\r\n    the King and Queen.--the King’s younger Brothers.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of March arrived news of the conquest of Martinico by\r\nGeneral Monckton[183] and Admiral Rodney:[184] a plan ascribed by\r\nthe people to Mr. Pitt, though executed under the auspices of the\r\nFavourite. In truth, the valour of the nation had taken such a bent,\r\nthat Lord Bute could not check it: nothing but a peace could chain\r\nit up. If the Earl did favour any part of the war, it was that in\r\nPortugal. Colonel Burgoyne[185] was ordered thither with five thousand\r\nfoot and six hundred horse; and there was a plan for regimenting\r\ntwenty-five thousand papists in Ireland for the same service; but the\r\nIrish Government did not approve of giving discipline and arms to\r\nsuch dangerous inmates. For General-in-Chief, it was proposed to send\r\nto Lisbon the Prince of Bevern. He had been suspected of infidelity\r\nby the King of Prussia,[186]--had been disgraced, and his intellects\r\nwere not reckoned sound. Lord Tyrawley sent home his aides-de-camp,\r\naffecting to wonder that we expected any invasion of Portugal. This was\r\nimputed to his disgust at not obtaining the command himself; he who\r\nwas a brave and old general, and who was perfectly acquainted with the\r\ncountry.[187] The Prince of Bevern declined the offer; and Count la\r\nLippe accepted it. He was born in England, had distinguished himself\r\nin every hussar-kind of service, and in his dress and manners copied\r\nCharles XII. of Sweden, though with more politeness. He found the\r\nPortuguese troops in the most deplorable state of cowardice and want of\r\ndiscipline. The English could not, and did not disguise their contempt\r\nof them. The Spanish army might have marched to Lisbon, had they met\r\nwith no obstruction but from the natives. The English troops saved that\r\ncountry; and Count La Lippe, before he left Portugal, formed a regular\r\narmy there.[188]\r\n\r\nThe facility which the Favourite found of mastering so great and\r\nvictorious a kingdom, and of removing the man who had carried the\r\nglory of his country so high, was not the only evidence, that however\r\nenlightened an age may be, knavery and folly need never despair. The\r\ntares they sow will shoot amidst any harvest. Will it be credited\r\nthat, while the Romish superstition was crumbling away even in Spain\r\nand Portugal, a set of enthusiastic rogues dared to exhibit in the\r\nvery heart of London, a pantomime of imposture, which would hardly\r\nhave been swallowed in a paltry village of Castile? The methodists had\r\nendeavoured to establish in Warwickshire, not only the belief, but\r\nthe actual existence of ghosts. Being detected, they struck a bold\r\nstroke, and attempted to erect their system in the metropolis itself.\r\nA methodist family, at first out of revenge, endeavoured to fasten on\r\none Parsons the imputation of having debauched and murdered his wife’s\r\nsister. A young girl was reported to be visited by the deceased, whom\r\nshe called Fanny, and with whom she established a correspondence of\r\nquestion and answer--not by words, but by scratching. A certain number\r\nof scratches signified “yes;” another number, “no.” At first this\r\nfarce, which was acted in Cock-lane, in the city, was confined to the\r\nmob of the neighbourhood. As the rumour spread, persons of all ranks\r\nthronged to the house. Two methodist clergymen constantly attended the\r\nchild, who lay in bed in a wretched chamber, with only a dim rushlight\r\nat one end. These worthy divines affected to cast an air of most\r\nserious import on the whole transaction, and by their interposition\r\nprompted Fanny and the girl on any dilemma. A servant wench commented\r\nand explained Fanny’s oracle. The father would accept no money from the\r\nvarious visitants, for which he was promised an adequate recompense\r\nby the chiefs of the sect. When the story had gained a requisite\r\nfooting, Fanny had the indiscreet confidence to declare that her body\r\nwas not in the vault where it had been interred. Samuel Johnson,\r\nauthor of the Dictionary, was in the number of the deluded, and with\r\nsome others as wise as himself, visited the vault, where, to the\r\ndisappointment of their credulity, they found the body.[189] Had the\r\nprecaution been taken of conveying it away, the fury of the people\r\nmight have been actuated to strange lengths; for so much credit had\r\nthe story gained, that Parsons, the accused, fearing a prosecution,\r\nbegan first. A regular trial[190] instantly unravelled the cheat: the\r\ngirl was detected of performing the scratchings herself, and one of\r\nthe clergymen proved to be her abettor. Lord Chief Justice Mansfield\r\ntried the cause: the divine had the impudence to present a letter to\r\nhim on the bench from the Archbishop of Canterbury,[191] interceding\r\non his behalf, for Secker had a fellow feeling for hypocritical\r\nenthusiasm. The Chief Justice put the letter into his pocket unopened,\r\nsaying it was impossible it could relate to the cause in question.\r\nYet the punishment of these impostors was very moderate: whereas the\r\nsame judge inflicted most severe penalties on one Anett, who published\r\nweekly papers against the book of Genesis. The methodists did not take\r\nshame. They turned informers against profaners of the Sabbath, tried to\r\nestablish great rigour on Good Friday and the fast-days, and to revive\r\nthe superstition of holidays, when even the late Pope himself, Benedict\r\nXIV.,[192] had struck several out of the calendar. But the ritual of\r\nthe Church of Rome was too rich in materials not to be copied by new\r\nzealots. They introduced into their service hymns sung in parts by\r\nchildren, as very captivating to the multitude; and the Countess of\r\nHuntingdon,[193] the patroness of the rising Church, erected a chapel\r\nat Bath, and at other places of drinking waters, the sick and diseased\r\nbeing an obvious prey to Reformers. Hogarth exerted his last stroke\r\nof genius on the occasion above mentioned: the print he published on\r\nthe Cock-lane Ghost had a mixture of humorous and sublime satire, that\r\nnot only surpassed all his other performances, but which would alone\r\nimmortalize his unequalled talents.\r\n\r\nThe expectations conceived of the new Czar were now verified. He\r\ndeclared to the Empress Queen, to France, and to Sweden, that he\r\nwas ready to abandon his conquests for peace, and hoped they were\r\nin the same disposition--not at the same price. France, indeed, had\r\nmany losses to regain, few acquisitions to restore--but her hopes\r\nwere placed on Spain. Sweden had made no conquests, and must obey\r\nthe dictates of so powerful a mediator; but the Empress Queen was\r\nfar from being equally tractable. Peter, however, having sacrificed\r\nthe first moments to decency, gave the next to the gratification of\r\nhis will; and without stipulating for his allies, whose politics and\r\nprocrastination were incompatible with his ardour, he not only made\r\npeace with his favourite monarch,[194] but promised the same troops,\r\nwhich under the late Czarina had almost crushed him. Nor was this a\r\nbare promise, but faithfully executed. Such admiration of a hero was\r\nnot likely to content itself with merely becoming his ally. Few men\r\nidolize heroism but they who feel the passion in their own breasts.\r\nHaving obliged Sweden to make peace too, the young Czar turned his eye\r\ntowards military exploits in a new field, and determined to attempt the\r\nconquest of the duchy of Sleswick from Denmark. Yet if he was dazzled\r\nby the martial talents of the King of Prussia, Peter had a heart\r\nsusceptible of the most extensive humanity. One of his first acts on\r\nhis accession was to bestow liberty on the Russian nobility. For the\r\npoor he lessened the tax on salt, and for the relief of all, abolished\r\nthe Inquisition of the State. All the exiles were recalled, or received\r\ngreat mitigation of their punishments. There was one man to whom the\r\nCzar, though not so bountiful as he ought to have been, was very\r\nkind. This was Count Schouvalow, the favourite and supposed husband\r\nof the late Czarina. A man, who in twelve years of absolute power had\r\nnever made an enemy; and who, had he ambitioned a crown as much as he\r\ndeserved one, might have reigned. This upright man told the Czar that\r\nhe had in his possession a very large sum of money, which he believed\r\nthe Empress, his late mistress, had intended he should take for his own\r\nuse, but not having been a specific gift, he thought it his duty to\r\nsurrender it to his Majesty. The Emperor said he was in great want of\r\nmoney, took it, but ordered him to choose two thousand pounds a year\r\nin land wherever he pleased. I knew this amiable person afterwards,\r\nwandering about Europe,[195] possessed of nothing beyond that revenue,\r\nand sighing after a country to which it had been imprudent to return.\r\n\r\nThe Czar and the King of Prussia wished to engage us in the war with\r\nDenmark; but though the Council was divided on the measure, Denmark was\r\ntoo intimately connected with us, and as a maritime power, was too near\r\na neighbour to Scotland. In this exigence the King of Denmark marched\r\nwith a considerable force to Hamburgh, and obliged that opulent city to\r\nfurnish him with a million of rix-dollars.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland seemed approaching a scene of a new kind. The jealousy of\r\ncommerce had ever swayed England to keep that kingdom in a state of\r\nhumiliation and restraint; consequently of poverty. The lowest class\r\nof people in no country less enjoyed the sweets of being; and in no\r\ncountry sought less to emerge from their state of barbarism. Proud and\r\nslothful, they created a kind of dignity to themselves from inactivity.\r\nTo labour no more than noblemen, was a sort of nobility; and ignorance\r\nof a happier fate was happiness. They preserved their ancient poetry\r\nand traditional genealogies; hated the English settled amongst them\r\nas invaders, and necessarily were bigoted to their old superstitions\r\nin opposition to the religion of their masters. In short, they wanted\r\nbut luxury, to have all the passions and prejudices of great lords. A\r\nconsiderable part of the island was plunged in this dismal darkness\r\nand misery. As a spirit of opposition and independence had spread\r\namongst the Protestant inhabitants, a spirit of improvement had gone\r\nforth too. Manufactures were established, roads and bridges made, and\r\nrivers rendered navigable. Inclosures for cultivation of lands had\r\nfollowed. Occupation of commons seemed usurpation to a race of lazy\r\nsavages; and the first murmurs were carefully blown up to rage by their\r\npriests. A massacre had been the last instance in which the Catholics\r\nof Ireland had had any superiority; and Popish priests are historians\r\nenough to be ignorant of no such era. It was the cause of property to\r\nthrow down inclosures; of heaven, to cut the throats of inclosers--and\r\nof France and Spain, to promote the good work. The tumults, however,\r\nbegan upon the single foot of their grievances. Great insurrections\r\nappeared in Waterford, the chief improvements having been made upon the\r\nBurlington estate. The rabble soon distinguished itself by the name\r\nof _White Boys_; and their instructors, to veil one nonsense under a\r\ngreater, taught them to give out that they were subject to the Queen\r\nof the Fairies, whom they called _Sieve Oltugh_, in whose name their\r\nmanifestoes were signed. It appeared afterwards on the trials of some\r\nof their chiefs, that this fairy sovereign resided at Versailles.\r\nFrench officers were discovered among them; and during the Duke of\r\nBedford’s regency, a rising had actually been made in the same quarter\r\njust as Thurot landed. After many outrages, they proceeded to cruelty,\r\nand buried three persons up to their chins, who had declared they\r\nknew the ringleaders. As their numbers and impunity increased, so did\r\ntheir insolence. They obliged the town of Lismore to hang out lights,\r\nand forced a justice of peace to fix up a proclamation by which they\r\nregulated the price of provisions, and forbad any cheese to be made\r\ntill after Lent, that the poor might have the milk--a proof that the\r\ndevotees of the Queen of the Fairies, and of the Virgin Mary, were\r\nequally attached to the observation of the Fast.\r\n\r\nFor six weeks this insurrection was neglected; and two regiments of\r\ndragoons, that were sent against them, proved unequal to the work. At\r\nlast the House of Commons took up the affair, and foot being ordered\r\nout against the seditious, the matter was quashed, though not entirely\r\nsuppressed, till the Earl of Hertford[196] was Lord Lieutenant,\r\nwho refusing to pardon some of the chiefs, notwithstanding very\r\nconsiderable intercession, an end was put to the affair--but unless\r\nthat country is more civilized and reclaimed from barbarism, or better\r\nguarded before another war breaks out, it will probably be selected\r\nby France and Spain for the first scene of their operations. At the\r\ntime of which I have been speaking, France was more earnest to make\r\na general peace, than to incense us by opening a war within our very\r\ngates,[197] and which might have made it dangerous for the Favourite to\r\nsecond their views.\r\n\r\nHe was hotly pushing his schemes to projection; and resolved not only\r\nto make the peace, but to be indisputably first minister when it should\r\nbe made. Mr. Pitt was removed, who could have obstructed the first\r\nobject; but while the Duke of Newcastle held the Treasury, there was a\r\ndivision of power, which all the lustre of favour could not entirely\r\nsurmount. They who looked forward, bowed to the idol; but they who held\r\nby gratifications to the Treasury, could not but kiss the hand that\r\ndealt the bribe. At first it was designed by disgusts to drive the\r\nDuke to resign. Elliot and Oswald[198] were instructed to treat him\r\nrudely at his own board: but an old minister or an old mistress endure\r\nmany shocks before they can be shaken off:[199] nor could all his own\r\ntreacheries persuade the Duke of Newcastle that Lord Bute could so soon\r\nforget how instrumental his Grace had been in undermining Mr. Pitt.\r\nHe still had a mind to be of the plot, though himself was become the\r\nobject of it.\r\n\r\nNewcastle’s friends were quicker sighted; and foreseeing that they\r\nmust again range under Mr. Pitt, if cast off by the Court, they began\r\nto have doubts and difficulties--and did but hasten their fall, by\r\ndaring to resume a right of opinion. The expense of the Portuguese war\r\nadministered their first pretence of complaint, and the protection\r\ngiven to the King of Prussia by the Czar, changed the posture of his\r\naffairs so advantageously, that it had no gross appearance, when the\r\nDukes of Cumberland, Newcastle, Devonshire, and their faction grew\r\nearnest for the continuance of the war in Germany. The Duke of Bedford,\r\nwho was more than half-gained to the Court, but who always added some\r\ncontradiction of his own, was averse to both wars, Portuguese and\r\nGerman; and Fox, who was willing to preserve an interest in the Duke\r\nof Cumberland, had a difficult part to act. He said to me, “The Duke\r\nof Devonshire says it is a Tory measure to abandon the Continent;\r\nfor my part I do not know who are Whigs; they bore the partiality of\r\nthe Pelhams[200] to the Tories, and Mr. Pitt’s declaration in their\r\nfavour, who had complained that they enjoyed none of the favours of\r\nGovernment.” Lord Mansfield would have preserved Newcastle to the\r\nCourt, but Lord Hardwicke pulled the other way. Lord Lincoln[201] was\r\ndevoted to Pitt, and wished to unite him and his uncle Newcastle. The\r\nDuke of Devonshire advised the latter to resign; but so great was his\r\ninclination to keep even the dregs of power with the dregs of life, and\r\nso great his fear of being called to account for the waste of money\r\non the German war, that though the King, as a fresh affront, declared\r\nseven new peers, without acquainting him, he not only overlooked it,\r\nbut begged his cousin, Mr. Pelham,[202] might be added to the number,\r\nand got the barony of Pelham bestowed on himself, with reversion to\r\nthat relation.\r\n\r\nI am forced to detail these intrigues, because the moment was critical,\r\nand because it gave birth to a new party, and to many subsequent\r\nevents. The Court was the more stiff, because they had conveyed a\r\nmessage through Count Virri,[203] the Sardinian minister in England, to\r\nthe Bailli de Solar,[204] the Sardinian minister at Paris, desiring to\r\nrenew the negotiation where it had been broken off. Lord Bute had gone\r\nfarther: he had ordered Sir Joseph Yorke to treat privately with the\r\nCourt of Vienna, without the knowledge of the King of Prussia. For some\r\ntime the Court of Vienna did not vouchsafe an answer. To the confusion\r\nof the Favourite, the first news he had of any answer to come, was from\r\nthe Baron de Knyphausen, the King of Prussia’s minister here.[205]\r\n\r\nApril 28th, the new peers kissed hands. Lord[206] Wentworth and Sir\r\nWilliam Courtenay,[207] Tories, were made Viscounts. Lord Egmont,[208]\r\nLord Milton,[209] Lord Brudenel, the Duke of Newcastle, Sir Edward\r\nHussy Montagu,[210] Mr. Vernon,[211] of Sudbury, and Mr. Lane,[212]\r\nthe two latter Tories, were made Barons, and Lady Caroline Fox, a\r\nBaroness. Lord Ligonier’s Irish peerage was entailed on his nephew. Mr.\r\nVernon,[213] clerk of the Council, and Mr. Olmius,[214] were created\r\nIrish Barons. The Prince of Mecklenburg,[215] brother of the Queen,\r\nwas made a Major-General. Lord Bute had often waved her request. She\r\nwas advised to apply to the Princess, and the favour was immediately\r\ngranted. Soon after, Buckingham House[216] was purchased and bestowed\r\non her Majesty, St. James’s not seeming a prison strait enough. There\r\nthe King and Queen lived in the strictest privacy, attended absolutely\r\nby none but menial servants; and never came to the palace but for the\r\nhours of levies and drawing-rooms. The King’s younger brothers were\r\nkept, till they came of age, in as rigid durance. Prince Henry, the\r\nthird, a very lively lad, being asked if he had been confined with the\r\nepidemic cold, replied, “Confined! that I am, without any cold;” and\r\nsoon after, when the Garter was bestowed on Prince William and Lord\r\nBute, Prince Henry said, “I suppose Mr. Mackenzie[217] and I shall have\r\nthe green ribands.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n  Debate in the House of Commons on a Vote of Credit and the Support\r\n    of Portugal.--The German War.--Pitt’s Speech.--Colonel\r\n    Barré’s Reply to Mr. Pitt.--Lord Bute’s Ambition.--The Duke\r\n    of Newcastle’s Resignation.--Fox and the Duke of Devonshire.--\r\n    Ingratitude of the Clergy to Newcastle.--Unwise conduct of Lord\r\n    Bute.--He is declared First Lord of the Treasury.--Sir Francis\r\n    Dashwood, Chancellor of the Exchequer.--His unfitness for that\r\n    Office.--His general Character.--His establishment of a Society\r\n    of Young Travellers.\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 12th. The House of Commons debated on a vote of credit, and the\r\nsupport of Portugal. Glover the poet pleaded against Portugal’s\r\nclaim to our assistance, from their many infractions of treaties,\r\nfrom their cramping our trade, and from the impossibilities our\r\nmerchants had found of obtaining redress; a complaint that seemed to\r\nbear hard on the late ministry: to which he added reflections on the\r\nextravagance of the German war, which, contrary to the professions\r\nof ministers, had grown from £200,000 to six or seven millions. Pitt\r\nwas offended, and corrected Glover, who threw his information on some\r\nnameless merchants, by whom he had been told that their remonstrances\r\non the difficulties of the Portuguese trade had not been read by\r\nthe ministers. Wilkes censured the weakness and irresolution of the\r\nministry; their abandoning Belleisle, and neglecting to send over the\r\nofficers to Germany. It was even said, he affirmed, that they had been\r\nhumiliating themselves at the Court of Vienna. Legge more gently, and\r\nBeckford with more rhodomontade, pressed the same accusations. The\r\nlatter was for invading Spain by sea; declared that the City suspected\r\nthe ministry of wavering, and demanded to have their _old minister_\r\nagain. Grenville answered finely, and compared the smallness of the\r\nsum demanded, £300,000, with the expense in Germany. Belleisle had\r\ncost more than what was now asked for Portugal. That Court knew how\r\nwe were embarrassed, and asked not more than she knew we could give.\r\nWhat proof was there of irresolution? was not Martinico conquered? was\r\nnot the Havannah likely to follow? or did Beckford think that great\r\nwords, blustered in Parliament, constituted resolution? Fluctuating\r\nreports were rather owing to stockjobbers than to fluctuation in the\r\nmeasures of Government. He affirmed that not one step had been taken at\r\nVienna derogatory to any of our connections. We had only tried to feel\r\nhow they relished the family-compact among the Bourbons. But whether\r\nthe resolution was taken to recall our troops from Germany, or at all\r\nevents to go on, would it be prudent to declare which was to be the\r\nmeasure?\r\n\r\nLord George Sackville was liberal in blaming the expense of the German\r\nwar, which he compared with that of Queen Anne; _the whole_ of which,\r\nhe maintained, except in 1711 and 1712, did not amount to what this\r\nGerman war had cost alone, though we had then employed more British\r\nand other troops than at present. Queen Anne’s war had never exceeded\r\neight millions, including garrisons, fleet, &c. The expense of 172,000\r\nmen from 1709 to 1711 had not gone beyond what one year had recently\r\ncost in Germany. If there had not been new inventions for expense, we\r\nshould not now be ready to beg peace.\r\n\r\nPitt, in a very capital style, took up the cause of Portugal: he did\r\nnot stoop to that little hackneyed practice of party, opposing whatever\r\nwas the measure of the adversary. He had stood forth for general war,\r\nand for reduction of the House of Bourbon. To advise still larger war\r\nwas constancy to the same plan; and it was still safer to advise it,\r\nwhen he was no longer answerable for the event. To oppose vigorous\r\nsteps would have been more truly lending aid to the Court, who wanted\r\nto get clear of the war.\r\n\r\nAs having been a public minister, he must not, he said, intrench\r\nhimself within his present private situation, but speak his opinion.\r\nHe should not wait for events, but speak boldly as a counsellor. If\r\nhe voted for this measure, it was giving the Crown his advice, as if\r\nhe was called to Council. He did think we ought to support Portugal,\r\nboth for commercial and political reasons. Portugal is in the immediate\r\npredicament of nearness to us after Ireland and our Colonies. _It\r\nassists, without draining us._ Assistance was a matter of justice due\r\nfrom us to an oppressed, insulted ally. There had not been such an\r\ninfraction of treaties as would release us from the ties of treaties.\r\nShould we sit with folded arms while the two branches of Bourbon, those\r\nproudest of the proud, would exclude us from neutral ports? We must set\r\nPortugal on its legs, not take it on our shoulders. He then expatiated\r\non the character of Carvalho, the prime minister of Portugal, his\r\ninflexibility to danger, his intrepidity; and drew a picture that\r\nmight almost have passed for his own, as he seemed to mean it should.\r\nWould there be danger in this measure? he was a co-operator in it. If\r\nyou, as a maritime power, cannot protect Portugal, Genoa will next be\r\nshut against you; and then the ports of Sardinia:--what! ports shut\r\nagainst the first maritime power in the world! He then turned Glover\r\ninto ridicule; said he admired his poetry, but _quanto optimus omnium\r\npoeta, tanto_--he would not, he said, go on. For the sum demanded, it\r\nmight easily be raised, or a million more: and he would give the same\r\nopinion, whether the Duke of Newcastle continued minister, or should be\r\nsucceeded by Mr. Fox, as was generally said to be the intention. The\r\nonly difficulty was to find funds. It had been predicated for three\r\nyears that we could not raise more money; therefore it was plain we\r\ncould. Lord George should have put into the scale what our enemies had\r\nlost; they had been losing, we acquiring. He hoped we should keep up\r\nour officers and our marine, and not decrease the latter, as we had\r\ndone after the last peace. France had last year spent eight millions\r\nin Germany. To outlast an enemy was worth perseverance. But we would\r\nnot distinguish between contracting our expenses and contracting our\r\noperations. He paid great compliments to the officers of land and\r\nsea, and pleaded earnestly against relinquishing Germany. It would be\r\nturning loose an hundred and forty thousand French to overrun the Low\r\nCountries and Portugal. If there was any odium from the German war, he\r\nbegged it might fall on him; though he had never seen a contractor, yet\r\nhe would not disculpate himself by censuring others; and he spoke in\r\nmitigation of the blame thrown on the Treasury, owning he thought some\r\nlittle might have been saved, but not suspecting them of dishonesty.\r\nYet, were an inquiry moved, he would second it; he would screen nobody.\r\nAfter the King of Prussia had been so ill-treated on our account, would\r\nwe throw such a power out of our alliance, only to save three or four\r\nhundred thousand pounds? But he thought he had heard the army was not\r\nto be recalled--was transported to find Lord Granby was going to it.\r\nHimself was the only man that agreed with the whole administration,\r\nfor he approved both of war in Germany and war in Portugal; and he\r\nwas so far from meditating opposition, that he should regard the man\r\nwho would revive parties as an enemy to his country. Himself had\r\ncontributed to annihilate _party_, but it had not been to pave the way\r\nfor _those who only intended to substitute one party to another_.[218]\r\nShould the least cloud arise between London and Berlin, he prayed for\r\ntemper and reconciliation. He wished to move that the continuation\r\nof the subsidy to Prussia might be added to the vote of credit; but\r\nit did not become him to move for more than was asked by the King’s\r\nservants: yet he wished the vote of credit had been greater, and knew\r\nthe Duke of Newcastle wished so too. He should rejoice to see the\r\nsession closed with the grant of a large sum of money, because England\r\ncould not well treat but at the head of all her force. Russia had\r\nacceded to Prussia--how much wiser to give money to that monarch now,\r\nwhen he is in a better situation, than, as you would do, if he were\r\nstill more distressed! Nay, that little teazing incident, Sweden, was\r\nremoved by dread of the Czar. Sweden is a free nation, _but factions\r\nand a corrupted senate have lowered it from the great figure it made an\r\nhundred years ago_. Act now, continued he, upon a great system, while\r\nit is in your power! A million more would be a pittance to place you at\r\nthe head of Europe, and enable you to treat with efficacy and dignity.\r\nSave it not in this last critical year! Give the million to the war\r\nat large, and add three, four, or five hundred thousand pounds more\r\nto Portugal; or avow to the House of Bourbon that you are not able to\r\ntreat at the head of your allies.\r\n\r\nThis speech, so artful, elevated, so much in character, and so\r\ndistressful to the Junto that were endeavouring to steal disgrace upon\r\nthemselves and their country in the face of the world, by setting up\r\none war against another, and dividing the attention of the public, till\r\nimpotence and mismanagement should render peace welcome,--this speech\r\ndid Colonel Barré attempt to answer; and did answer it, only in length.\r\nHe was sensible that he had disgusted mankind by his indecent brutality\r\nto so great a statesman: his friends had told him that his invectives,\r\nilliberal as they had been, were reckoned the produce of study; and\r\nthat he must shine in cool argument, lest he should be thought a bully\r\nrather than an orator. If they apprehended this, the result of their\r\nlessons was a proof that their apprehensions had not been ill-founded.\r\nNothing could be more cold and dull than Barré’s reply to Mr. Pitt.\r\nIt revenged the latter for the former insult. Calvert,[219] a mad\r\nvolunteer, who always spoke what he thought, and sometimes thought\r\njustly, was so struck with Barré’s phlegmatic impropriety, that he\r\ntold the House it had put him in mind of a poet, who being at sea in a\r\ntempest, and being missed while all hands were on deck, was found half\r\nasleep in the cabin; and, being asked why he did not assist to save\r\nthe ship, replied, he was thinking how to describe the storm?[220] The\r\nmoney was voted, and nothing more of consequence passed that session in\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nBoth Houses thus complaisant and submissive, there wanted but the\r\noffice of prime minister to glut the Favourite’s ambition: and\r\nno wonder that he, who had dared to strike the name of the first\r\nmonarch in military glory in Europe from the list of Great Britain’s\r\npensioners, only to gratify the feminine piques of the backstairs; and\r\nwho had ventured successfully to remove Mr. Pitt from the command of\r\nthat country which he had saved, restored, exalted;--no wonder such a\r\nPhaëton should drive over a ridiculous old dotard, who had ever been\r\nin everybody’s way, and whose feeble hands were still struggling for\r\npower, when the most he ought to have expected, was, that his flattery\r\nand obsequiousness might have moved charity to leave him an appearance\r\nof credit. It was absurd for him to stay in place; insolent to attempt\r\nto stay there by force, and impudent to pretend to patriotism when\r\ndriven out with contempt. Against his will he was preserved from having\r\na share in the infamy of the ensuing peace.\r\n\r\nMay 14th, the Duke[221] acquainted the King that he would resign, who\r\nanswered coldly, “Then, my Lord, I must fill up your place as well as I\r\ncan.” Still Newcastle lingered; and, as he owned afterwards to the Duke\r\nof Cumberland, his friends had laboured to prevent the fatal blow. Lord\r\nMansfield, he said, had _pleaded_ with Lord Bute for above an hour, and\r\ncould not extract from him a wish that the Duke should continue in the\r\nTreasury. Fox asked Lord Mansfield if this was true? He replied, “Not\r\nan hour, for I soon saw it was to no purpose.”\r\n\r\nThus disgraced, and disgracing himself, on the 26th the Duke of\r\nNewcastle resigned: and he, who had begun the world with heading\r\nmobs against the ministers of Queen Anne; who had braved the\r\nHeir-apparent[222] of the new family, and forced himself upon him as\r\ngodfather to his son; who had recovered that Prince’s favour, and\r\npreserved power under him at the expense of every minister whom that\r\nPrince preferred; and who had been a victorious rival of another\r\nPrince of Wales;[223] was now buffeted from a fourth Court[224] by a\r\nvery suitable competitor, and was reduced in his tottering old age to\r\nhave recourse to those mobs and that popularity which had raised him\r\nfifty years before; and as almost the individual crisis was revolved,\r\nwith a scandalous treaty and a new prospect of arbitrary power, it\r\nlooked as if Newcastle thought himself young again, because the times\r\nof his youth were returned, and he was obliged to act with boys!\r\n\r\nSuch pains, however, had been taken to disjoint his faction, that\r\nhis exit from power was by no means attended with consolatory\r\ncircumstances. The Duke of Devonshire would not resign, though he\r\ndeclared he would seldom or never go to council. Fox had warned him\r\nnot to be too hasty in embarking in a party in which Pitt must be a\r\nprincipal actor; and remembering his Grace how large a share Pitt had\r\nhad in planting the Tories at Court, and that, speaking of Legge, Pitt\r\nhad said, “I will have no more ear for Whig grievances.” The rest of\r\nNewcastle’s friends were as little disposed to follow him: but that he\r\nmight taste the full mortification of being deserted by those whom he\r\nhad most obliged, whom he had most courted and most patronized, the\r\nclergy gave the most conspicuous example of ingratitude. For thirty\r\nyears Newcastle had had the almost sole disposal of ecclesiastic\r\npreferments, and consequently had raised numbers of men from penury\r\nand the meanest birth to the highest honours and amplest incomes in\r\ntheir profession. At this very period there were not three bishops\r\non the bench who did not owe their mitres to him. His first levée\r\nafter his fall was attended but by one bishop,[225] Cornwallis of\r\nLichfield; who being a man of quality, and by his birth entitled to\r\nexpect a greater rise, did but reflect the more shame on those who owed\r\neverything to favour, and scarce one of them anything to abilities.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of Lord Bute was not more wise than that of Newcastle.\r\nInstead of sheltering himself under that old man’s name from whatever\r\ndanger there might be in making peace, the Earl was driving together\r\nall those whom he ought to have kept divided, and really seemed jealous\r\nlest himself should not have the whole odium of sacrificing the glories\r\nand conquests of the war; an infatuation that so far excuses him, as he\r\nmust have thought he did a service to his country in restoring peace:\r\nbut what must his understanding have been if he could think that peace\r\nwould be a benefit, let the terms be what they would? He supposed,\r\ntoo, that Newcastle, having in opposition to Pitt declared for peace,\r\ncould not retract, and be against the peace. This was not knowing\r\nNewcastle or mankind. The situation, too, was materially changed: the\r\nweight of Russia was transferred from the hostile to the friendly\r\nscale; Martinico was fallen; and Europe could scarce amass the symptom\r\nof a fleet. A mind less versatile than Newcastle’s could not want\r\narguments against a precipitate treaty. Yet was it not Newcastle,\r\nnor a scandalous treaty that shook the Favourite’s power. It was his\r\nignorance of the world; it was a head unadapted to government, and\r\nrendered still less proper for it by morose and recluse pride, and a\r\nheart that was not formed to bear up a weak head, that made him embark\r\nimprudently, and retreat as unadvisedly.\r\n\r\nLord Bute, on the resignation of the Duke of Newcastle, was immediately\r\ndeclared First Lord of the Treasury. George Grenville succeeded him as\r\nSecretary of State, and Sir Francis Dashwood was made his Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer; a system that all the lustre of the Favourite’s power\r\ncould not guard from being ridiculous, though to himself mankind bowed\r\nwith obsequious devotion. Grenville was ignorant of foreign affairs,\r\nand, though capable of out-talking the whole corps diplomatique, had no\r\naddress, no manner, no insinuation, and had, least of all, the faculty\r\nof listening. The Favourite himself had never been in a single office\r\nof business, but for the few months that he had held the seals: of the\r\nrevenue he was in perfect ignorance, knew nothing of figures, and was\r\na stranger to those Magi to the east of Temple-Bar, who, though they\r\nflock to a new star, expect to be talked to in a more intelligible\r\nlanguage than that of inspiration. When a Lord Treasurer or a First\r\nLord of the Treasury is not master of his own province, it suffices if\r\nthe Chancellor of the Exchequer is a man of business, and capable of\r\nconducting the revenue, of planning supplies, and of executing the\r\nmechanic duties of that high post. But in the new dispensation it was\r\ndifficult to say which was the worst suited to his office, the minister\r\nor his substitute. While the former shrouded his ignorance from vulgar\r\neyes, and dropped but now and then from a cloud an oracular sentence;\r\nthe deputy, with the familiarity and phrase of a fish-wife, introduced\r\nthe humours of Wapping behind the veil of the Treasury. He had a\r\ncoarse, blunt manner of speaking, that, looking like honesty, inclined\r\nmen to hold his common sense in higher esteem than it deserved; but,\r\nhaving neither knowledge[226] nor dignity, his style, when he was to\r\nact as minister, appeared naked, vulgar, and irreverent to an assembly\r\nthat expects to be informed, and that generally chooses to reprehend,\r\nnot to be reprehended. When a statesman ventures to be familiar, he\r\nmust captivate his audience by uncommon graces, or win their good-will\r\nby a humane pleasantry that seems to flow from the heart, and to be\r\nthe effusion of universal benevolence. This was the secret as well as\r\ncharacter of Henry the Fourth of France: even the semblance of it stood\r\nhis grandson, our Charles the Second, in signal stead, and veiled his\r\nunfeeling heart, and selfish and remorseless insensibility.\r\n\r\nMen were puzzled to guess at the motive of so improper a choice as\r\nthis of Sir Francis Dashwood. The banner of religion was displayed at\r\nCourt, and yet all the centurions were culled from the most profligate\r\nsocieties. Sir Francis had long been known by his singularities and\r\nsome humour. In his early youth, accoutred like Charles the Twelfth,\r\nhe had travelled to Russia in hopes of captivating the Czarina; but\r\nneither the character nor dress of Charles were well imagined to catch\r\na _woman’s_ heart. In Italy, Sir Francis had given in to the most\r\nopen profaneness; and, at his return, had assembled a society[227]\r\nof Young Travellers, to which a taste for the arts and antiquity, or\r\nmerely having travelled, were the recommendatory ingredients. Their\r\npictures were drawn, ornamented with symbols and devices; and the\r\nfounder, in the habit of St. Francis, and with a chalice in his hand,\r\nwas represented at his devotions before a statue of the Venus of\r\nMedicis, a stream of glory beaming on him from behind her lower hand.\r\nThese pictures were long exhibited in their club-room at a tavern\r\nin Palace Yard; but of later years Saint Francis had instituted a\r\nmore select order. He and some chosen friends had hired the ruins of\r\nMedmenham Abbey, near Marlow, and refitted it in a conventual style.\r\nThither at stated seasons they adjourned; had each their cell, a proper\r\nhabit, a monastic name, and a refectory in common--besides a chapel,\r\nthe decorations of which may well be supposed to have contained the\r\nquintessence of their mysteries, since it was impenetrable to any\r\nbut the initiated. Whatever their doctrines were, their practice was\r\nrigorously pagan: Bacchus and Venus were the deities to whom they\r\nalmost publicly sacrificed. The old Lord Melcomb was one of the\r\nbrotherhood. Yet their follies would have escaped the eye of the\r\npublic, if Lord Bute from this seminary of piety and wisdom had not\r\nselected a Chancellor of the Exchequer. But politics had no sooner\r\ninfused themselves amongst these rosy anchorites, than dissensions\r\nwere kindled, and a false brother arose, who divulged the arcana, and\r\nexposed the good Prior, in order to ridicule him as Minister of the\r\nFinances. But, of this, more hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n  Honours heaped on Lord Bute.--His first Levée.--Archbishop\r\n    Secker.--Lord Halifax appointed to the Admiralty.--Lord Melcomb a\r\n    Cabinet Councillor.--Lord Bute’s Haughtiness.--First appearance\r\n    of “The North Briton.“--Its excessive Audacity.--Sketch of its\r\n    Author, John Wilkes.--Churchill, Wilkes’s Associate.--Earl\r\n    Temple.--Capture and recapture of Newfoundland.--The French\r\n    camp surprised by Prince Ferdinand.--Propensity of the Court\r\n    for Peace.--General Conway--Peter the Third.--The Czarina\r\n    Elizabeth.--The Empress Catherine.--Horrible Conspiracy against\r\n    Peter.--Catherine raised to the Throne.--Murder of Peter.--\r\n    Effect of the Russian Revolution on the King of Prussia.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery honour the Crown could bestow was now to be heaped on the\r\nFavourite. He was fond of his own person, and obtained the Garter in\r\ncompany with Prince William.[228] His first levée was crowded like a\r\ntriumph. Archbishop Secker, who waited at it, pretended that, seeing\r\na great concourse as he came from Lambeth,[229] he had inquired the\r\noccasion, and had gone in. Lincoln’s-inn-fields, where the Duke of\r\nNewcastle lived, was not now in the way to Lambeth. About the same\r\ntime died Lord Anson, and left the Admiralty too at the disposal\r\nof the Favourite. He wished to bestow it on Lord Sandwich, to make\r\nroom for Rigby, as Vice-Treasurer of Ireland; but the shyness of the\r\nDuke of Cumberland, whose creature Sandwich was, made that measure\r\nimpracticable; and the Admiralty was bestowed on Lord Halifax, with\r\npermission to retain Ireland for a year. Elliot,[230] a chief confident\r\nof the Favourite, was appointed Treasurer of the Chambers; and Lord\r\nMelcombe a cabinet councillor: but there ended all the ambition of the\r\nlatter, he dying of a dropsy in his stomach a few weeks afterwards.\r\n\r\nThese successes and the tide of power swelled the weak bladder of the\r\nFavourite’s mind to the highest pitch. His own style was haughty and\r\ndistant; that of his creatures insolent. Many persons who had absented\r\nthemselves from his levée were threatened with the loss of their own,\r\nor the places of their relations, and were obliged to bow the knee.\r\nBut this sunshine drew up very malignant vapours. Scarce was the Earl\r\nseated but one step below the throne, when a most virulent weekly\r\npaper appeared, called _the North Briton_. Unawed by the prosecution\r\nof the Monitor (another opponent periodic satire, the author of which\r\nhad been taken up for abusing favourites), and though combated\r\nby two Court papers called the Briton and the Auditor (the former\r\nwritten by Smollet,[231] and the latter by Murphy,[232] and both\r\nwhich the new champion fairly silenced in a few weeks), the North\r\nBriton proceeded with an acrimony, a spirit, and a licentiousness\r\nunheard of before even in this country. The highest names, whether of\r\nstatesmen or magistrates, were printed at length, and the insinuations\r\nwent still higher. In general, favouritism was the topic, and the\r\npartiality of the Court to the Scots. Every obsolete anecdote, every\r\nilliberal invective, was raked up and set forth in strong and witty\r\ncolours against Scotland. One of the first numbers was one of the\r\nmost outrageous, the theme taken from the loves of Queen Isabella and\r\nMortimer. No doubt but it lay open enough to prosecution, and the\r\nintention was to seize the author. But on reflection it was not thought\r\nadvisable to enter on the discussion of such a subject in Westminster\r\nHall; and, as the daring audaciousness of the writer promised little\r\ndecorum, it was held prudent to wait till he should furnish a less\r\ndelicate handle to vengeance: a circumspection that deceived and\r\nfell heavy on the author, who, being advised to more caution in his\r\ncompositions, replied, he had tried the temper of the Court by the\r\npaper on Mortimer, and found they did not dare to touch him.\r\n\r\nThis author, who must be so often mentioned in the following pages, was\r\nJohn Wilkes, member of Parliament for Ailesbury. He was of a plebeian\r\nfamily,[233] but inherited a tolerable fortune in Buckinghamshire,\r\nand had been bred at Oxford, where he distinguished himself by\r\nhumorous attacks on whatever was esteemed most holy and respectable.\r\nUnrestrained either in his conduct or conversation, he was allowed\r\nto have more wit than in truth he possessed; and, living with rakes\r\nand second-rate authors, he had acquired fame such as it was, in the\r\nmiddling sphere of life, before his name was so much as known to the\r\npublic. His appearance as an orator had by no means conspired to\r\nmake him more noticed. He spoke coldly and insipidly, though with\r\nimpertinence; his manner was poor, and his countenance horrid. When his\r\npen, which possessed an easy impudent style, had drawn the attention of\r\nmankind towards him, and it was asked, who this saucy writer was? Fame,\r\nthat had adopted him, could furnish but scurvy anecdotes of his private\r\nlife. He had married a woman of fortune, used her ill, and at last\r\ncruelly, to extort from her the provision he had made for her separate\r\nmaintenance; he had debauched a maiden of family by an informal promise\r\nof marriage, and had been guilty of other frauds and breaches of trust.\r\nYet the man, bitter as he was in his political writings, was commonly\r\nnot ill-natured or acrimonious. Wantonness, rather than ambition or\r\nvengeance, guided his hand; and, though he became the martyr of the\r\nbest cause, there was nothing in his principles or morals that led him\r\nto care under what government he lived. To laugh and riot and scatter\r\nfirebrands, with him was liberty. Despotism will for ever reproach\r\nFreedom with the profligacy of such a saint!\r\n\r\nAssociated with Wilkes in pleasure and in the composition of the North\r\nBriton was a clergyman named Churchill, who stepped out of obscurity\r\nabout the same period, and was as open a contemner of decency as Wilkes\r\nhimself, but far his superior in the endowments of his mind. Adapted\r\nto the bear-garden by his athletic mould, Churchill had frequented no\r\nschool so much as the theatres. He had existed by the lowest drudgery\r\nof his function, while poetry amused what leisure he could spare, or\r\nrather what leisure he _would_ enjoy; for his Muse, and his mistress,\r\nand his bottle were so essential to his existence, that they engrossed\r\nall but the refuse of his time. Yet for some years his poetry had\r\nproved as indifferent as his sermons, till a cruel and ill-natured\r\nsatire on the actors had, in the first year of this reign, handed him\r\nup to public regard. Having caught the taste of the town, he proceeded\r\nrapidly, and in a few more publications started forth a giant in\r\nnumbers, approaching as nearly as possible to his model Dryden, and\r\nflinging again on the wild neck of Pegasus the reins which Pope had\r\nheld with so tight and cautious a hand. Imagination, harmony, wit,\r\nsatire, strength, fire, and sense crowded on his compositions; and they\r\nwere welcome for him--he neither sought nor invited their company.\r\nCareless of matter and manner, he added grace to sense, or beauty to\r\nnonsense, just as they came in his way; and he could not help being\r\nsonorous, even when he was unintelligible. He advertised the titles of\r\nhis poems, but neither planned nor began them till his booksellers, or\r\nhis own want of money, forced him to thrust out the crude but glorious\r\nsallies of his uncorrected fancy. This bacchanalian priest, now\r\nmouthing patriotism, and now venting libertinism, the scourge of bad\r\nmen, and scarce better than the worst, debauching wives, and protecting\r\nhis gown by the weight of his fist, engaged with Wilkes in his war\r\non the Scots; and sometimes learning, and as often not knowing, the\r\ncharacters he attacked,[234] set himself up as the Hercules that was\r\nto cleanse the State, and punish its oppressors: and, true it is, the\r\nstorm that saved us was raised in taverns and night-cellars; so much\r\nmore effectual were the orgies of Churchill and Wilkes than the daggers\r\nof Cato and Brutus. The two former saved their country, while Catiline\r\ncould not ruin his,--a work to which such worthies seemed much better\r\nadapted.\r\n\r\nBut while the wit and revelry of Wilkes and Churchill ran riot, and\r\nwere diverted by their dissipation to other subjects of pleasantry\r\nor satire, they had a familiar at their ear, whose venom was never\r\ndistilled at random, but each drop administered to some precious work\r\nof mischief. This was Earl Temple, who whispered them where they might\r\nfind torches, but took care never to be seen to light one himself.\r\nCharacters so rash and imprudent were proper vehicles of his spite; and\r\nhe enjoyed the two points he preferred even to power,--vengeance, and a\r\nwhole skin.\r\n\r\nThis triumvirate has made me often reflect that nations are most\r\ncommonly saved by the worst men in them. The virtuous are too\r\nscrupulous to go the lengths that are necessary to rouse the people\r\nagainst their tyrants.\r\n\r\nWhile Wilkes and Churchill attacked the plenitude of the Favourite’s\r\npower, another cloud overcast it, which, though inconsiderable and\r\nof short duration, contributed to lower him in the estimation of the\r\npeople. An account arrived of the French having surprised and made\r\nthemselves masters of Newfoundland. General Amherst[235] did not wait\r\nfor orders from hence, but, detaching his brother with a body of\r\nforces, recovered the island, and made the French commander prisoner.\r\n\r\nPrince Ferdinand, not less active and vigilant, had surprised the\r\nFrench camp, desirous of embarking us farther in the war, and hoping\r\nthat new successes would animate the nation to resist the propensity\r\nof the Court for peace. General Conway took the castle of Waldeck by\r\nstratagem; and the Hessians triumphed in other attempts.[236] The\r\nPrince told Mr. Conway that we might be joined by a body of Russians\r\nfor a _trait de plume_, but neither miscarriage nor success could\r\nbeat the Favourite from his plan of pacification; though, had we been\r\ninclined to listen to that overture, a second change of scene in Russia\r\nwould have disconcerted our treating with that nation.\r\n\r\nPeter the Third, with a humane heart, had neither judgment nor\r\npatience. He meant to do right, and thought absolute power could not\r\nbe better employed than in doing right without delay. His approbation\r\nand contempt were prompt and strongly marked; and, as his understanding\r\nwas incapable of embracing many objects, his few ideas took the\r\nlarger possession of him. Being educated a Lutheran, he despised the\r\nclergy of his empire, and had offended the soldiery by enforcing\r\ndiscipline, by restoring the conquests of the preceding reign, by\r\nmanifesting indiscreet predilection for a regiment of Holstein, his\r\nnative country, and by so blind a devotion to the King of Prussia, that\r\nhimself wore that Prince’s uniform. Indolence and drunkenness were\r\nadded to this want of conduct; but he had to struggle with a yet more\r\ndangerous evil. The late Czarina, his aunt, finding no issue arise\r\nfrom his marriage with the Princess of Anhalt Zerbst, questioned the\r\nlatter; and, it is said, was informed by her that she must not expect\r\nany lineage from her nephew. Elizabeth replied, the State demanded\r\nsuccessors, and left the Grand Duchess at liberty to procure them by\r\nwhose assistance she pleased. A son and daughter were the fruits of\r\nher obedience. But, though her politics were satisfied, it is said\r\nthe mind of Elizabeth was not, and that she privately saw her cousin,\r\nthe dethroned Czar Yvan. The opinion is general, though at what time\r\nit happened is uncertain, that drugs to destroy his understanding had\r\nbeen administered to that poor Prince. Peter, though on obtaining the\r\ndiadem he openly exhibited a mistress, could not but know that if his\r\nwife had spoken truth, he could have no claim to be father of her\r\nchildren: thence he had the same curiosity as his aunt, visited the\r\nCzar Yvan, and, as the rumour went, intended to name him his successor.\r\nSuch rumours were sufficient to alarm the Empress, who was slighted by\r\nPeter, and had reason to think he meant to divorce her. That bold bad\r\nwoman, who had all the talents for empire that her husband wanted, and\r\nwho had been educated by a most artful and intriguing mother, and who,\r\nwith a commanding person, had a heart susceptible of warm impressions,\r\nwas then under the influence of Orloff, her lover, and her confident\r\nthe Princess Daskau, a young woman little above twenty years of age,\r\nbut of an adventurous spirit, and, what made her situation singular,\r\nsister of the Emperor’s mistress.\r\n\r\nThis junto agreed to believe that Peter would not limit his aversion\r\nfor the Empress to mere divorce, but intended to put her to death; a\r\ncharge most improbable, and inconsistent with the Emperor’s humane and\r\nunsuspecting nature. How early a conspiracy was formed, I pretend not\r\nto say; nor, in relating the events of so distant a country, and whence\r\ntruth is so difficult to be procured, do I pretend to give more than\r\nthe outlines of their general story, collected from the most credible\r\nauthority. But, however dark and secret the measures were, the facts\r\nresulting from them were so glaring, so horrid, so impious, that\r\nneither the lying palliatives set forth by the criminals themselves,\r\nnor the mercenary flattery of the learned, will be able to wash off\r\nfrom the Empress the foul stains of treason, murder, and usurpation.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor had not reigned above six months, when the plan for\r\ndethroning him was formed, and ready to break forth. One of the\r\nconspirators being arrested for another crime, the rest concluded the\r\nwhole was discovered; but, instead of dispersing or seeking safety by\r\nflight, the chiefs trusted to rashness for impunity. Orloff galloped\r\noff to the Czarina, who was absent from the capital at a separate\r\nvilla from the Emperor, and told her she had not a moment to lose.\r\nThat virago having ordered her women to report she was confined by\r\nsickness, and placing guards upon the road to prevent notice of her\r\nmarch being sent to the Czar, rode directly to the army and demanded\r\ntheir protection. One only regiment, that of Holstein, refused their\r\nsupport. All the rest saluted her Empress; and the clergy who trembled\r\nfor their idols, and resented the loss of their beards, ran headlong\r\ninto rebellion. The senate, the nobility, the people, all concurred to\r\nraise to the throne in her own name a woman who had no one claim of any\r\nsort to be their sovereign.\r\n\r\nNariskin, master of the horse, was the sole subject who had fidelity\r\nenough to make his escape and inform the Emperor of the catastrophe\r\nthat awaited him. That poor prince was at Oraniebaum, a villa.\r\nThunderstruck with the news, he had not presence of mind to prepare\r\nhimself to save either his empire or his life. He lost both by losing\r\na day, which he wasted in drinking and vain consultation, after having\r\nfruitlessly sent to Peterhoff to secure the Empress. Next morning he\r\nheard that his wife at the head of fourteen thousand men was marching\r\nto seize him. He then attempted to make his escape to Holstein, and\r\nembarked for Cronstadt--but it was too late! The garrison had received\r\norders to fire on him. Exhausted with perturbation of mind, with drink\r\nand fatigue, he sunk under his misfortunes, surrendered himself, and\r\ndesired to see his wife, now his sovereign. As incapable of pity as of\r\nremorse, she refused to admit him, ordering him to sign a renunciation\r\nof his crown, and a most humiliating recapitulation of his errors. Nor\r\ndid this avail: within very few days he was murdered.\r\n\r\nThus far Catherine had acted like other monsters of both sexes. Her\r\nnext measures were as weak towards men as they were profane in the\r\nface of Heaven. In very silly manifestoes she endeavoured to justify\r\nher crimes; and dared even to call on the Most High as the instigator\r\nof her abominations, speaking of her husband but as her neighbour, and\r\nof his death as a judgment. Vain and contemptible was this attempt: it\r\ncould blind none but those who would be willing to acquit her without\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe Princess Daskau soon lost the favour she had so blackly merited;\r\nand Rosamouski, Hetman of the Tartars, whom many accused as the very\r\nassassin of his master, but who, as his friends urged, was forced into\r\nthe conspiracy, went into a voluntary exile. Orloff had gained deeper\r\nhold on his mistress, and kept her in subjection. Panin, governor of\r\nher son, was another of the principal conspirators. Bestucheff, the\r\nlate chancellor, was recalled; and thus he, Count Munich, Biron, once\r\nDuke of Courland, and master of the empire, with the various exiles of\r\nthe late reigns, found themselves again together at Petersburgh.[237]\r\n\r\nAfter the murdered Prince himself, no man was likely to be more\r\naffected by this revolution than the King of Prussia. The Russians,\r\nso lately his enemies, had not been pleased to become his allies.\r\nBut, though the new Empress was necessitated to comply with the\r\nwishes of her subjects in withdrawing them from that service, she was\r\nnot disposed in so critical a situation to renew the war, or to add\r\nprovocation to a man whom she had deprived of so useful and essential a\r\nfriend. She therefore only made the requisition of the thirty thousand\r\nRussians in his service, but allowed him for a few days to profit by\r\ntheir assistance, and extricate himself out of this new difficulty. He\r\nreturned for answer, that he would only drive Marshal Daun from the\r\nhills before him, and her troops should return. He did so. This was\r\ntaking his part with admirable presence of mind. He knew that Daun must\r\nin a day or two learn the departure of the Russian troops, and would\r\nattack him when weakened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n  Birth of the Prince of Wales.--Treasure of the Hermione.--Conquest\r\n    of the Havannah.--Indifference of the Court on that event.--\r\n    Negotiations for Peace.--Not popular in England.--Reception in\r\n    France of the Duke of Bedford.--The Duc de Nivernois.--Beckford\r\n    elected Lord Mayor.--Duel between Lord Talbot and Wilkes.--Lord\r\n    Bute’s Delegates in the House of Commons.--Grenville and Lord\r\n    Bute.--Union of Lord Bute and Fox.--The latter reproached by the\r\n    Duke of Cumberland.--Lord Waldegrave and the Duke of Devonshire\r\n    decline the proposal of Fox.--Disgust at the union of Bute and\r\n    Fox.--Purchase of a majority to approve the Peace.--Fox’s revenge\r\n    against the Duke of Devonshire.--The King and the Marquis of\r\n    Rockingham.--Further severity to the Duke of Devonshire.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of August, the Queen was delivered of a Prince of Wales;\r\nand the same morning the treasure of that capital prize, the Hermione,\r\narrived in town in many waggons, and passed through the City to the\r\nTower. The sum taken amounted to near eight hundred thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the following month came the first news from the\r\nHavannah; and before the end of it we learned the entire conquest\r\nof that important place by the three Keppels,[238]--the Earl of\r\nAlbemarle, the Commodore and the Colonel his brothers. The honour they\r\nwon was a little soiled by their rapaciousness and by our great loss\r\nof men: but to Spain the blow was of the deepest consequence, and the\r\nplace irrecoverable by any force they could exert. Yet such a victory\r\nseemed to infuse as little joy into the Court of St. James’s as into\r\nthat of Madrid. The Favourite and his creatures took no part in the\r\ntransports of the nation; and, when he declined availing himself of any\r\nmerit from the conquest, it was plain he was grieved either to have\r\nmore to restore at the peace, or less reason for making that peace but\r\non the most advantageous terms: but he was infatuated, and, breaking\r\nthrough all the barriers of glory, he sent the Duke of Bedford to Paris\r\nto settle the preliminaries, whence the Duc de Nivernois arrived for\r\nthe same purpose.\r\n\r\nSullen and silent as Mr. Pitt was, and feeble and impotent as the\r\nfaction of Newcastle, still the City and merchants showed some symptoms\r\nof indignation at this obstinate alacrity for treating. The Duke of\r\nBedford was hissed as he passed through the principal streets; and\r\ntreasonable papers were dispersed in the villages round London. But\r\nin France the Duke was received as their guardian angel. The most\r\ndistinguished and unusual honours were paid to him; and the principal\r\nmagistrate of Calais, thinking him descended from the other John Duke\r\nof Bedford, brother of Henry the Fifth, complimented his Grace (and\r\nno doubt felicitated himself on the comparison) on seeing him arrive\r\nwith as salutary and pacific, as his great ancestor had formerly landed\r\nthere with hostile intentions.\r\n\r\nHis counterpart, the Duc de Nivernois, had been long employed in\r\nnegotiations at Rome and Berlin, but had not the good fortune to please\r\nat the latter Court, where the King even turned into ridicule his\r\npuny and emaciated little figure. His ill-health, the titles that had\r\ncentred in his person, and had filled him with vanity (for he was Peer\r\nof France, Prince of the Empire, Grandee of Spain, and a Roman Baron),\r\nand his affection for polite learning, had disposed him to live in a\r\nretired circle of humble admirers, to whom he almost daily repeated\r\nhis works both in prose and verse; but not without having attempted to\r\nsoar higher. He had assumed devotion, in hopes of being Governor to\r\nthe Dauphin: but, except in concluding the peace, which, considering\r\nour eagerness, he could not avoid concluding, he had never met with\r\nbrilliant success in any of his pursuits; being, as the celebrated\r\nMadame Geoffrin[239] said of him, “Guerrier manqué, politique manqué,\r\nbel esprit manqué, enfin manqué partout.” To England he bore no\r\ngood-will: and though, till the treaty was signed, he concealed, as\r\nmuch as peevishness would let him, the disgust he took to this country,\r\nand was profuse in attentions to all, and in assiduity of court to\r\nthe Favourite and his faction, yet, though he remained here a very\r\nlittle time after the signature, his nature broke forth, and scarce\r\nwas enough good-breeding left to skin over the sore reluctance of a\r\nmomentary stay.[240]\r\n\r\nThe nation was far less impatient than the Court for peace; and, though\r\nno great burst of spirit appeared against it, there were sufficient\r\nsymptoms of ill-humour to warn the prime minister, that, without\r\nredoubling his industry and taking more solid measures, he might\r\nstill be foiled in the attempt of forcing an inglorious peace on the\r\nnation. Beckford, who had been desirous of resigning his alderman’s\r\ngown, was, against his will, elected Lord Mayor; a mark of their\r\ngood-will to his friend, Mr. Pitt. The North Briton spread the alarm\r\nas much as possible; but the flippancy of the author began to draw\r\nstorms on his own head. Wilkes having in one of those papers ridiculed\r\nthe flattery of Lord Talbot, who, officiating as Lord High Constable\r\nat the Coronation, had endeavoured to back his horse to the gate of\r\nWestminster Hall, that he might not turn his own back on the King, was\r\nchallenged by Lord Talbot; and after a series of letters, which had\r\nmore the air of a treaty than a defiance, and consequently reflected no\r\ngreat honour on either, they fought a bloodless duel on Bagshot Heath.\r\n\r\nThese little rubs having alarmed the Favourite, he began to consider\r\nhow ill-qualified his delegates would be to support his treaty in the\r\nHouse of Commons, if either warmly or wittily attacked. It was too\r\nprecious a cause to trust to Sir Francis Dashwood. Grenville had not\r\nmuch more credit, though more sense and gravity; but was tedious and\r\nill-heard, and had been trained to such obsequious deference for Mr.\r\nPitt, that at that time no man thought him likely or proper to be\r\nopposed to so capital a master. Grenville was besides unsatisfied; and,\r\naiming higher, had been unwilling to risk an appearance of honesty\r\nwhen it was not in his own cause. He had neglected to traffic with the\r\nmembers of the House of Commons; had secured none of them; and, being\r\npressed by Lord Bute on that head, fairly owned he would not deal with\r\nthem, unless the power was his own, and their dependence rested on\r\nhim. Lord Bute was startled, and would have compromised, as himself\r\nwas unacquainted with the men, that the recommendation of members to\r\nfavour,--that is, to places and pensions,--should be made through\r\nGrenville to himself. But Grenville was obstinate, and soon had cause\r\nto repent both his frankness and perverse ambition. It was instilled\r\ntoo into Lord Bute, that Grenville was not so much at variance with\r\nhis family as he wished to be thought--an imputation of which he soon\r\nappeared to be guiltless: but the die was cast; and he heard with\r\nunspeakable astonishment, and with a rage not to be described, that he\r\nmust exchange with Lord Halifax, that is, return to be First Lord of\r\nthe Admiralty, and quit the seals, and with them the management of the\r\nHouse of Commons, which Mr. Fox had consented to undertake. The blow to\r\nGrenville was grievous, but could not be avoided or resented--_then_.\r\nNo retreat towards his brothers Pitt and Temple was left him. Avarice\r\ndecided the conflict, and he submitted to accept the Admiralty.\r\n\r\nWhen Fox thus stooped to be the Favourite’s agent, he gratified many\r\nmore passions than he could be supposed to mortify. In truth, except\r\nhis pride, which had seldom restrained him, what views could he have\r\nbut this step would gratify? To ravish the glories of the war from\r\nhis rival Mr. Pitt, to sacrifice them, and to be selected to defend\r\nthat sacrifice, glutted his spirit of competition. Favourite he could\r\nnot be, for the Princess[241] hated, and Lord Bute feared him: but\r\nto be necessary to both was worth ambition, and the surest means of\r\ngratifying it; and to be master of the secret of the negotiation\r\npromised that superabundance of wealth, which by that secret he\r\nacquired. Should he succeed in carrying through the peace, he would\r\nhave the first weight in the House of Commons (for what harmony there\r\nwas between these _rival friends_ may readily be conjectured); should\r\nhe fail, it were but the loss of the Paymaster’s place, inconsiderable\r\nin peace compared with its produce in time of war: for it must be noted\r\nthat he would not accept the seals, and thus stood in no responsible\r\nlight; a strain of prudence that might have administered alarm to the\r\nFavourite himself!\r\n\r\nThus in the space of four months were the Princess and Lord Bute by\r\ntheir rash and ill-digested measures reduced to lean for support\r\non Fox, whom they had most dreaded as the minister of the Duke of\r\nCumberland; and who would add his own unpopularity to that of Lord\r\nBute, and would necessarily determine Pitt to oppose with increased\r\nresentment.\r\n\r\nFox had embraced this invitation with such alacrity that he had signed\r\nthe treaty with Lord Bute without consulting any of his friends;\r\nconcluding, as over-refined politicians are apt to do, that he could\r\nbring them to his lure, and, while he paid too high compliments to\r\nhis own abilities, setting too slight estimation on theirs. His first\r\napplication was to the Duke of Cumberland. That haughty and sensible\r\nPrince received him with scorn, reproached him warmly with lending\r\nhimself to support a tottering administration, and bitterly with his\r\nformer declarations of having given up all ambitious views. The next\r\ntrial made by Fox was on Lord Waldegrave,[242] to whom he urged that\r\nhis Lordship had so much ridiculed the Princess and Lord Bute, that\r\nthey had more to complain of than he had; and he endeavoured to enclose\r\nthe Earl in his treaty with the Court, by asking him, if it should be\r\nproposed to call his Lordship to the Cabinet Council, whether he should\r\nlike it? The Earl, who had been bred a courtier, who was of too gentle\r\nmanners for opposition, and too shrewd not to see that the power of the\r\nCrown was predominant, desired time to consider, and went to Windsor\r\nto consult the Duke of Cumberland. His Royal Highness acknowledged the\r\nattention with many thanks, but would give no advice. The Earl, who\r\nwanted not to be told, that not advising him to make his court when he\r\nwas disposed to do it, was advising him against it, was not courtier\r\nenough to quit a Prince, his friend, for a Court that he himself\r\ndespised and hated; and immediately wrote to Fox to desire the proposal\r\nmight not be made to him. The Duke of Devonshire[243] was in like\r\nmanner endeavoured to be softened by Fox, who wished to wear the credit\r\nof reconciling his own friends to the peace, and bringing their support\r\nto the administration. But here again he was foiled. The Duke gave him\r\na civil answer, assured him of his personal good wishes, but declined\r\nany connection with him as minister.\r\n\r\nAbandoned by his highest and most showy friends, Fox felt the\r\nmortification of discredit both with his patron and the public, and\r\nthe keenest appetite for revenge. As a politician, his credit was\r\nsaved by his industry and success; and by his arts his vengeance was\r\nsoon gratified on two of those that thus cast him off. But now were\r\nthe seeds sown, which, though slowly, produced such bitter crops in\r\nsubsequent years. Detested by the public, Fox could never recover from\r\nthe stain contracted at this period:--but first we must relate his\r\ntriumph, and the temporary victory he gained for the Court.\r\n\r\nNothing was so unpromising as the prospect of the new system at first.\r\nAll the devotion of the Tories to the Court could not reconcile them\r\nto the nomination of Fox. They knew the mischief he had done them,\r\nand had not the quickness to see that a renegade is tied to make\r\nsatisfaction by greater benefits. Lord Mansfield, not trusted, as he\r\nhad expected to be, by Lord Bute, had blown up discontents against the\r\npeace. Lord Egremont and George Grenville had adopted those doubts;\r\nand doubts from men in high place convey extensive influence. Had the\r\npeace been instantaneously proposed to the House of Commons, there is\r\nno question but it would have been rejected; so strong a disgust was\r\ntaken at the union of Bute and Fox, and so numerous were their several\r\npersonal enemies. Yet in one respect Bute had chosen judiciously: Fox\r\nwas not to be daunted, but set himself to work at the root. He even\r\nmade applications to Newcastle; but the Duke of Cumberland[244] had\r\ninspired even Newcastle and Devonshire with resolution! This, however,\r\nwas the last miscarriage of moment that Fox experienced. Leaving\r\nthe grandees to their ill-humour, he directly attacked the separate\r\nmembers of the House of Commons; and with so little decorum on the\r\npart of either buyer or seller, that a shop was publicly opened at\r\nthe Pay-office, whither the members flocked, and received the wages\r\nof their venality in bank-bills, even to so low a sum as two hundred\r\npounds for their votes on the treaty. Twenty-five thousand pounds, as\r\nMartin,[245] Secretary of the Treasury, afterwards owned, were issued\r\nin one morning; and in a single fortnight a vast majority was purchased\r\nto approve the peace!\r\n\r\nBad as that peace proved, it was near being concluded on terms still\r\nmore disadvantageous; for France, receiving earlier intelligence than\r\nwe did of the capture of the Havannah, had near prevailed on the Duke\r\nof Bedford to sign the treaty,--but Aldworth,[246] his secretary, had\r\nthe prudence or foresight to prevent that precipitate step.[247]\r\n\r\nThe Court having secured the obedience of Parliament, it was determined\r\nto assume a high tone of authority; to awe, and even to punish the\r\nrefractory. “The King, it was given out, _would_ be King,--would _not_\r\nbe dictated to by his ministers, as his grandfather had been. The\r\nprerogative was to shine out: great lords must be humbled.” Fox--whose\r\nlanguage ever was, that the Crown must predominate whenever it would\r\nexert its influence--warmly upheld the doctrine of rewards and\r\npunishments; and, having employed the former with so much success, he\r\nwas rejoiced to inflict the latter to glut his own vengeance. The first\r\nfruit of these councils struck mankind with astonishment. The Duke of\r\nDevonshire, who had kept himself in the country, coming to town on the\r\n28th of October, went to pay his duty to the King, and, as is customary\r\nwith the great officers, went to the backstairs, whence he sent the\r\npage in waiting to acquaint his Majesty with his attendance. “Tell\r\nhim,” said the King angrily, “I will not see him.” The page, amazed,\r\nhesitated. The King ordered him to go and deliver those very words. If\r\nthe page had been thunderstruck, it may be imagined what the Duke felt.\r\nHe had, however, the presence of mind to send in the page again to ask\r\nwhat he should do with his key of Lord Chamberlain. The reply was,\r\n“Orders will be given for that.” The Duke went home with a heart full\r\nof rage, and tore off his key, which immediately after he carried to\r\nLord Egremont, the Secretary of State; and the next morning his brother\r\nLord George Cavendish, and Lord Besborough[248] his brother-in-law,\r\nresigned their places. As the Court urged that the Duke’s disgrace\r\nwas owing to his refusal of attending Councils, his Grace’s friends\r\npleaded that he had asked and obtained the King’s leave not to attend\r\nthem, as he seldom had attended them even in the late reign; and\r\nthat, his summons having been made by a commis in Lord Egremont’s\r\noffice, the Duke did not think that such a message interfered with his\r\ndispensation. Some said there had been no intention to dismiss the\r\nDuke; attributing the affront to a sudden start of passion in the King,\r\nwho, coming from Richmond that morning, had met the Dukes of Devonshire\r\nand Newcastle together in a chariot, whence suspecting a Cabal, he\r\nhad gone home in anger, and, at the moment the Duke arrived at St.\r\nJames’s, was writing to Lord Bute that _now was the time_; words\r\nwhich proved at least that the Duke’s disgrace had been meditated,\r\nand which in truth nobody doubted. The Princess had more than once\r\ntermed him ironically _the Prince of the Whigs_; and his Grace having\r\ndared to desert from Fox’s banner, left no doubt of the latter having\r\ncontributed to irritate the prejudice already conceived. Nor could Fox\r\nwipe off the suspicion: though, as soon as the affront was known, he\r\nhad hurried to Devonshire House,[249] and protested his utter ignorance\r\nof any such design. The Duke received him coolly, did not pretend to\r\nbelieve him; and his family never forgave it.\r\n\r\nThe fairness of the Duke’s character, his decent and timid caution,\r\nand the high rank in which he stood with the party, made the measure\r\nmuch wondered at; yet it was far from producing such open offence\r\nas might have been expected, nor did the consequences spread. The\r\nMarquis of Rockingham, five days afterwards, resigned the Bedchamber;\r\nbut, offering to explain his disgusts, the King with much haughtiness\r\nrefused to hear him--another strain of authority much vaunted, and not\r\nwithout effect. The Peerage itself kissed the rod, which was declared\r\nto be held out to humble them. Nor did they take the alarm, though the\r\nrigour towards the Duke of Devonshire was prosecuted farther; for, a\r\nPrivy Council being summoned November the 3rd, the King ordered the\r\nDuke’s name to be struck out of the Council-book: a severity of which\r\nthere had been no precedent in the last reign but in the cases of\r\nLord Bath and Lord George Sackville; the first, in open and virulent\r\nopposition; the second on his ignominious sentence after the battle\r\nof Minden. John Duke of Argyle,[250] when his regiment was taken from\r\nhim, was not thus affronted; nor had George the First refused to admit\r\nLord Oxford[251] to kiss his hand on the Queen’s death, nor denied an\r\naudience to the Earl Marichal[252] involved in Jacobitism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n  Preliminaries of Peace with France and Spain.--Secret springs of\r\n    Political actions.--Embassy to the Court of Spain offered to\r\n    Lord Sandwich.--Insult to the Duke of Cumberland.--Honours and\r\n    Preferments.--Resignation of Lords Ashburnham and Kinnoul.--Lord\r\n    Lincoln’s ingratitude to the Duke of Newcastle.--Bait offered to\r\n    Lord Granby.--Mr. Conway.--The Duke of York obliged to go to\r\n    Italy.--Profusion exercised by the Court.--Charles Townshend’s\r\n    want of judgment.--His bons mots.--Attempt to propitiate\r\n    Walpole.--Correspondence between him and Fox respecting the\r\n    Rangership of the Parks offered to Lord Orford.--Conduct of the\r\n    latter.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of the month a courier arrived with the preliminaries\r\nsigned by France and Spain. I shall not detail those preliminaries,\r\ntoo well known, and to be found in all common histories. It is my\r\npart to explain, as far as I could know them, the leading motives\r\nof actions and events; and, though the secret springs are often\r\nunfathomable, I had acquaintance enough with the actors to judge with\r\nbetter probability than the common of mankind; and where these memoirs\r\nare defective or mistaken, still they may direct to the inquiry after\r\nsounder materials, and prove a key to original papers that may appear\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nThe peace with Spain, as it opened a door for an embassy to that Court,\r\nafforded Mr. Fox a new opportunity of revenge; and as this measure at\r\nleast he could not waive the honour of having suggested, so did it\r\ncorroborate the belief of his being the author of the other too.[253]\r\nHe immediately offered that embassy to Lord Sandwich,[254] who as\r\ngreedily accepted it. Sandwich, rejected and exploded by all mankind,\r\nhad been adopted, fostered, patronized in the most kind and intimate\r\nmanner by the Duke of Cumberland; nor had he the confidence now to\r\nconsult his Royal Highness, or to venture in person to notify to him\r\nhis desertion. He wrote. The insult was too glaring, and could not be\r\npardoned to either Fox or Sandwich, both of whom were for ever excluded\r\nfrom the Duke’s presence but at his public levées, and there underwent\r\nthe most mortifying neglect from him; though Fox often sued in most\r\nabject manner to be forgiven.\r\n\r\nSeverity gratified, honours and preferments were amply proffered,\r\nand but few rejected. The Duke of Manchester[255] had been named to\r\nthe Bedchamber the instant Lord Rockingham had quitted it. The Duke\r\nof Marlborough[256] and the Earl of Northumberland[257] were made\r\nLords Chamberlains to the King and Queen; the latter of which posts\r\nLord Bristol had refused to accept, from attachment to Mr. Pitt. Lord\r\nEgmont was made Postmaster in the room of Lord Besborough. The seals\r\nof Secretary of State, with the _feuille de bénéfices_, were once\r\nmore offered to the Duke of Newcastle; but he replied, it would be\r\ntime enough to talk of business when the Parliament met. His friend,\r\nLord Ashburnham,[258] resigned: and so did his other friend, Lord\r\nKinnoul,[259] who, though his bosom-confident, dwelling in his very\r\nhouse, had borne his disgrace, and now affected to forget him, and to\r\nplead obligations to the Duke of Devonshire, at the same time declaring\r\nhis reluctance to break with the Court; a reluctance so decisive, that\r\nhe retired into Scotland, and came no more to London till the year 1770.\r\n\r\nLord Lincoln,[260] Newcastle’s favourite nephew and heir, displayed\r\nmore open ingratitude. He asked an audience of the King, called his\r\nuncle a factious old fool, and said he could not forget a message which\r\nhimself had brought from his uncle to his Majesty in the year 1757, in\r\nwhich the Duke had signified to his then Royal Highness, that, if he\r\nwould not disturb the tranquillity of the rest of his grandfather’s\r\nreign, the Duke, in or out of place, though he hoped the latter, would\r\nsupport his measures to the utmost. It was justice, to recollect this\r\npromise; but Lincoln’s subsequent conduct, at the same time that it was\r\ninconsistent, was honourable neither towards the King nor his uncle. He\r\nhad a second audience, in which he told the King that the Duke insisted\r\non his resigning; “but if I must,” said he, “I will show but the more\r\nwarmly the next day that I remember the message, of which I have kept\r\na copy in writing.” The third time, when he went to resign, he said\r\nhe must oppose. The King told him his tone was much changed since his\r\nfirst audience. But the Court never had much reason to complain of Lord\r\nLincoln’s hostilities. His exceeding pride kept him secluded from the\r\nworld, and rarely did he appear either at Court or in Parliament. For\r\nsome time he fluctuated between Lord Bute and Mr. Pitt, to the latter\r\nof whom he at last attached himself; but with constant derision of,\r\nand insult to, his uncle, and, whatever were the Duke of Newcastle’s\r\nfaults, cruel and unmerited. The truth was, Lord Lincoln’s avarice was\r\nas unbounded as his haughtiness. Though possessed of two places for\r\nlife, and one of them the most lucrative in England, the auditorship of\r\nthe Exchequer, which never produces less than eight thousand pounds\r\na year, and during the war had brought in at least twenty, he had\r\nresented the Duke’s not bestowing on him two more places for the lives\r\nof his younger sons.\r\n\r\nAs every door was to be opened or barricaded that could admit or\r\nexclude friends or enemies to the preliminaries, messengers were\r\nstationed at the sea-ports to waylay Lord Granby on his return from\r\nthe army, with the most advantageous offers, as the Ordnance and\r\ncommand of the army, setting aside the worthy old Marshal Ligonier[261]\r\nwith a large pension; a bait gulped by the former without scruple.\r\nMr. Conway, to whom they did the honour of thinking they could not\r\nbribe him, (and whoever they could not bribe, they concluded, could\r\nnot approve their treaty,) was decorated with the empty honour of\r\nconducting home the army; which would and did prevent his return before\r\nthe discussion of the preliminaries in Parliament. And the Duke of\r\nYork, whom they would not silence by favours, they obliged to go on an\r\nidle expedition to Italy.\r\n\r\nThe profusion exercised on this occasion, and which reduced the\r\nCourt to stop even the payments of the King’s bedchamber, made men\r\nrecall severely to mind the King’s declaration on the choice of the\r\nParliament, that he would not permit any money to be spent on elections.\r\n\r\nTheir greatest difficulty was with Charles Townshend, who slipped\r\nthrough their fingers at every turn, and could be held down to no\r\ndecision. He refused to be First Lord of Trade with the same power\r\nover the colonies as had been granted to Lord Halifax. At the same\r\ntime he was loth to resign, though in that quarter the needle rested\r\nat last,--a mark of that want of judgment that was conspicuous in all\r\nhis actions; for, having fluctuated from uncertainty of the issue, he\r\nchose the losing side but the very day before the great victory of the\r\nCourt on the preliminaries. His post of Secretary at War was soon after\r\ngiven to Ellis.[262] Townshend’s bons mots wounded where his conduct\r\ncould not. It being reported, to justify the treatment of the Duke of\r\nDevonshire, that the King complained he had been kept prisoner; “True,”\r\nsaid Townshend, “he is a prisoner, but he mistakes his jailor.” Another\r\nof his sayings had not only proved a prophecy, but was often applied in\r\nthe following years. He had said of the last arrangement before Fox was\r\nset at the head, that “it was a pretty lutestring administration, which\r\nwould do very well for summer wear.”\r\n\r\nAfter so many considerable names, it will look, perhaps, like vain\r\npresumption in me to name myself as one whom it was thought necessary\r\nto manage. But, as it proves how low the arts and attention of Fox\r\ncould descend, and as my answer (at least, I have always suspected\r\nso) contributed to an event of much consequence afterwards, I shall\r\nbe excused by the candid for giving some account of it. I had, soon\r\nafter my appearance in the world, lived in much intimacy with Fox,\r\nhad warmly espoused his side when persecuted by the Duke and Duchess\r\nof Richmond,[263] and had happened to have conferred some other little\r\nfavours on him. I had carefully avoided receiving the smallest or\r\nthe greatest from him. As his character opened more to the world, I\r\ndeclined any connection with him in politics, though determining never\r\nto have a quarrel with him, as I well knew his vindictive nature. When\r\nhe united with the Duke of Newcastle, he had offered in truth slightly\r\nenough to procure the reversion of a considerable place, which I hold\r\nonly for my brother’s life, to be confirmed for my own, provided I\r\nwould be upon good terms with the Duke. I had ever, in the most open\r\nmanner, spoken of that minister with contempt; and having never to this\r\nhour received a favour from any minister, I shall be believed that\r\nI never would accept one from Fox. I answered accordingly with much\r\nscorn, “I will not accept that reversion from the Duke.” Fox, knowing\r\nthis spirit, and knowing, too, that I had declared to Lord Bute that\r\nI would receive no favour from the Court, had no hope of fixing me to\r\nhis measures by any offers he could make. Nor yet had he had reason to\r\nknow I was averse to the preliminaries, on which I had kept silent.\r\nThe truth was, I had been civilly treated on the King’s accession,\r\nand had so much disliked Newcastle and Hardwicke, that few men were\r\nbetter pleased than myself to see a new administration; and had not\r\nthe standard of Prerogative been hoisted, and disgrace brought on\r\nthis triumphant country, I should probably have remained a satisfied\r\nspectator. Yet was I not so steeled by the glories of the war as to be\r\ninsensible to the yearnings of humanity; and therefore, ignominious as\r\nthe articles were, my conscience would not suffer me to speak against a\r\ntreaty that would stop such effusion of blood. Sentiments, I confess,\r\nmost heroic: yet I blush not to own that they divided my sensations,\r\nand forbad my voting _against_ the preliminaries, though I was too much\r\nan Englishman to vote _for_ them, and accordingly left the House before\r\nthe putting of the question.\r\n\r\nAs doubtless I did not trust Fox with this situation of my breast, nor\r\nmade my court on his new dignity, he concluded I was in the number of\r\nthe disapprovers. Direct offers, or direct threats, would be vain: but\r\nto put me in mind of my dependence on my nephew, by whose interest I\r\nwas chosen into Parliament,[264] and which dependence Fox ought to have\r\nremembered I had braved[265] for his sake; or of my dependence on the\r\nTreasury, which could hurt me severely[266] by stopping the payments of\r\nmy place in the Treasury; he wrote me the following letter:--\r\n\r\n                              Nov. 21, 1762.\r\n  DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n  As soon as I heard that the Parks,[267] which Lord Ashburnham\r\n  had quitted, were worth 2200_l._ a year (as they certainly\r\n  are), I thought such an income might, if not prevent, at least\r\n  procrastinate your nephew’s ruin.[268] I find nobody knows his\r\n  Lordship’s[269] thoughts on the present state of politics.\r\n\r\n  Perhaps he has none. Now, are you willing, and are you the proper\r\n  person, to tell Lord Orford that I will do my best to procure\r\n  this employment for him, if I can soon learn that he desires\r\n  it? If he does choose it, I doubt not of his and his friend\r\n  Boone’s[270] hearty assistance, and believe I shall see you too,\r\n  much oftener in the House of Commons. This is offering you a\r\n  bribe, but ’tis such a one as one honest good-natured man may\r\n  without offence offer to another.\r\n\r\n  If you undertake this, do it immediately, and have attention to\r\n  my part in it, which is delicate. If you do not undertake it, let\r\n  me know your thoughts of the proposal, whether I had better drop\r\n  it entirely, or put it into other hands, and whose.\r\n\r\n  You’ll believe me when I tell you that goodness of heart has as\r\n  much share in this to the full as policy.\r\n\r\n            Yours ever,\r\n                      H. FOX.\r\n\r\nThis artful and disingenuous letter the messenger was ordered to\r\ndesire I would answer immediately. I determined at once to guard my\r\nexpressions in such a manner, that, under the appearance of the same\r\ninsincere cordiality which Fox affected to wear, it should not be\r\npossible to fix either declaration or engagement upon me; showing him\r\nat the same time that I would neither accept favour from him, nor be\r\nindirectly obliged to him through my nephew. I was aware that, if I\r\nrefused to notify the offer to Lord Orford, he or his friends, and\r\nthe Court too, would raise a clamour against me for preventing his\r\nreceiving a favour that he wanted so much: and, as he was already Lord\r\nof the Bedchamber, there could be no reason in honour why he should not\r\naccept an addition of income; nor was there anything in his principles\r\nthat would make him difficult to be farther bound. With these views I\r\nreturned the following answer:--\r\n\r\n                              Nov. 21, 1762.\r\n  DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n  After having done[271] what the world knows I have done, to try\r\n  to retrieve the affairs of my family, and to save my nephew from\r\n  ruin, I can have little hopes that any interposition of mine will\r\n  tend to an end I wish so much. I cannot even flatter myself with\r\n  having the least weight with my Lord Orford. In the present case\r\n  I can still less indulge myself in any such hopes. You remember\r\n  in the case of the St. Michael election, how hardly he used me on\r\n  your account. I know how much he resented last year his thinking\r\n  you concerned in the contest about the borough[272] where he set\r\n  up Mr. Thomas Walpole; and, as he has not even now deigned to\r\n  answer Mr. Boone’s letter,[273] I can little expect that he will\r\n  behave with more politeness to me. Yet, I think it so much my\r\n  duty to lay before him anything for his advantage, and what is\r\n  by no means incompatible with his honour, that I will certainly\r\n  acquaint him immediately with the offer you are so good as to\r\n  make him.\r\n\r\n  You see I write to you with my usual frankness and sincerity;\r\n  and you will, I am sure, be so good as to keep to yourself the\r\n  freedom with which I mention very nice family affairs. You must\r\n  excuse me if I add one word more on myself. My wish is, that\r\n  Lord Orford should accept this offer; yet, I tell you truly, I\r\n  shall state it to him plainly and simply, without giving any\r\n  advice, not only for the reasons I have expressed above, but\r\n  because I do not mean to be involved in this affair any otherwise\r\n  than as a messenger. A man, who is so scrupulous as not to\r\n  accept any obligation for himself, cannot be allowed to accept\r\n  one for another without thinking himself bound in gratitude as\r\n  much as if done to himself. The very little share I ever mean\r\n  to take more in public affairs shall and must be dictated by\r\n  disinterested motives. I have no one virtue to support me but\r\n  that disinterestedness; and, if I act with you, no man living\r\n  shall have it to say that it was not by choice and by principle.\r\n\r\n                I am, dear sir,\r\n            Your sincere humble servant,\r\n                            HORACE WALPOLE.\r\n\r\nThere were truths enough to displease, and they did not escape Fox. The\r\nconsequence to me was, that by his influence with Martin, Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, my payments were stopped for some months, nor made\r\nbut on my writing to Lord Bute himself; which, as, notwithstanding\r\nthis persecution, I would take no part with the administration, proved\r\nthat the delay had not flowed from the minister himself, but from his\r\nassociate, my good friend: nor did it stop there. In the meantime I had\r\nwritten thus to Lord Orford:--\r\n\r\n                              Arlington-street, Nov. 22, 1762.\r\n  MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n  I must preface what I am going to say, with desiring you to\r\n  believe that I by no means take the liberty of giving you\r\n  any advice; and should the proposal I have to make to you be\r\n  disagreeable, I beg you to excuse it, as I thought it my duty to\r\n  lay before you anything that is for your advantage, and as you\r\n  would have reason to blame me if I declined communicating to you\r\n  a lucrative offer.\r\n\r\n  I last night received a letter from Mr. Fox, in which he tells\r\n  me, that, hearing the Parks, vacant by Lord Ashburnham’s\r\n  resignation, are worth 2200_l._ a year, he will, if you desire to\r\n  succeed him, do his best to procure that employment for you, if\r\n  he can soon learn that it is your wish.\r\n\r\n  If you will be so good as to send me your answer, I will acquaint\r\n  him with it; or, if you think it more polite to thank Mr. Fox\r\n  himself for his obliging offer, I shall be very well content to\r\n  be, as I am in everything else, a cypher, except when I can show\r\n  myself,\r\n\r\n                      My dear Lord,\r\n            Your very affectionate humble servant,\r\n                                      HORACE WALPOLE.\r\n\r\nTo this letter, nor to the offer, did Lord Orford give himself the\r\ntrouble of making the least reply; but, arriving in town on the very\r\nday the Parliament met, he came to me, and asked what he was to do? I\r\nreplied very coldly, I did not know what he intended to do; but, if his\r\nmeaning was to accept, I supposed he ought to go to Mr. Fox, and tell\r\nhim so, I having nothing farther to do with it than barely to acquaint\r\nhim with the offer. Without preface or apology, without recollecting\r\nhis long enmity to Fox (it is true, he did not know why he was Fox’s\r\nenemy), and without a hint of reconciliation, to Fox he went, accepted\r\nthe place, and never gave that ministry one vote afterwards; continuing\r\nin the country, as he would have done if they had given him nothing. I\r\nreturn from this digression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n  Conference between the Duke of Cumberland and Mr. Pitt.--Pitt’s\r\n    lofty style and inconclusive manner.--Want of union in the\r\n    Opposition.--Anxiety of the Ministers.--Debates in both Houses\r\n    on the Preliminaries of Peace.--Sudden and unexpected appearance\r\n    of Mr. Pitt.--Legge, Fox, and Beckford.--Prerogative.--Pitt’s\r\n    Speech.--His retirement from the House when Fox rose to speak.--\r\n    Speech of the latter.--Charles Townshend’s versatility.--The\r\n    Minority on the Division.--Exultation of the Princess of Wales on\r\n    the Preliminaries being carried.--Severe political persecution.--\r\n    Numerous dismissals from place.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rupture between the Duke of Cumberland and Fox seemed naturally to\r\npave the way for a connection between that Prince and Mr. Pitt. They\r\naccordingly met, and had a conference of four hours; but there their\r\namity commenced and ended. The good sense of his Royal Highness could,\r\nin spite of all his haughtiness, make him bend properly. Pitt, having\r\nless good sense than parts, and affecting more haughtiness even than\r\nhe possessed, and being full of schemes rather than plans, could not\r\nbe brought to any rational system. Meaning to make use of the Prince\r\nbut to a certain degree,--that is, to thwart the Court, or to give it\r\njealousy, not to erect the Duke as head of a party,--he talked in his\r\nusual vague and inconclusive manner; his nearest friends having often\r\nsaid, that between the uncommunicativeness of his temper and the want\r\nof suite in his reasoning faculties, it was ever impossible to pin him\r\ndown to any chain of definite propositions.\r\n\r\nThis the Duke experienced, and combated in vain. All he could draw from\r\nPitt was, a positive demand that the peace should be opposed by the now\r\nforming party. Yet would he not submit to see the Duke of Newcastle;\r\nthough, in his lofty style, he said he would accept of the Duke of\r\nCumberland’s guarantee of Newcastle’s fidelity. It was difficult for\r\nthe chiefs to coalesce: Lord Hardwicke had publicly commended the\r\npreliminaries; and though he had rejected large offers made to his son,\r\nCharles Yorke, he and his friends knew not decently how to fly to Mr.\r\nPitt’s banner, which they had so lately levelled. This want of union in\r\nthe Opposition gave all the remaining advantage to the administration\r\nthat they yet wanted. Mr. Pitt affected to be a chief without a party,\r\nand the party without him had no other chief; for Newcastle was worse\r\nthan none, and the Duke of Cumberland had too much deference for the\r\nCrown, and was too much above courting the people, to be fit to figure\r\nas a ringleader.\r\n\r\nIn this temper of things did the Parliament meet November 25th. Lord\r\nEgmont and Lord Weymouth[274] moved the Address in the Lords, where\r\nthere was no opposition: Lord Carysfort[275] and Lord Charles Spencer\r\nin the Commons. Nicholson Calvert made a warm speech against the\r\npeace, and was answered by Birt, who gave Mr. Pitt the honour of the\r\nfirst plan for taking Martinico. Beckford was yet more violent against\r\nthe treaty; and compared Florida, which was to be ceded to us, for\r\nbarrenness to Bagshot Heath. Charles Townshend made a trimming speech,\r\nthough very personal against Beckford, and the day ended without a\r\ndivision; Mr. Pitt being confined at home with the gout. Without doors\r\nthe scene was more turbulent: the Favourite was assaulted in his chair\r\nby a formidable mob, and had not the Guards arrived opportunely, would\r\nhardly have escaped with life.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of the month the preliminaries were laid before both\r\nHouses, who were acquainted that the King had ordered them to be\r\nprinted and distributed to the members on the morrow. The Duke of\r\nGrafton in the Lords, Calvert and Bamber Gascoyne in the Commons,\r\nobjected to this; it being usual for the two Houses to give the\r\norders for printing papers communicated to them; but the first method\r\nwas acquiesced in, and the Lords resolved to take the papers into\r\nconsideration on the Thursday sevennight following. Lord Pomfret[276]\r\nmoved to order the high bailiff of Westminster to attend, to give\r\nan account why he had taken no measures to disperse the mob on the\r\nfirst day of the session. At the same time the ministers endeavoured,\r\nby money and threats, to silence or intimidate the printers of\r\nnewspapers, libels, and satiric prints, and succeeded with a great\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of December, Calvert moved to defer considering the\r\npreliminaries till the Thursday sevennight following, as Mr. Pitt\r\nwas not able to attend; but the ministers, and for that very reason,\r\ninsisted on bringing them on upon the same day with the Lords, and\r\ncarried their motion by 213 to 74; so unpromising was this outset\r\nof the new Opposition, in which appeared the families of Cavendish,\r\nFitzroy, and Townshend.\r\n\r\nThe memorable day, December 9th, being arrived, both Houses sat on\r\nthe preliminaries. Lord Shelburne and Lord Grosvenor moved to approve\r\nthem. The Duke of Grafton, with great weight and greater warmth,\r\nattacked them severely, and, looking full on Lord Bute, imputed to\r\nhim corruption and worse arts. The Duke was answered by the Earl of\r\nSuffolk; and then Lord Temple spoke with less than usual warmth. The\r\nFavourite rose next, and defended himself with applause, having laid\r\naside much of his former pomp. He treated the Duke of Grafton as a\r\njuvenile member, whose imputations he despised; and, for the Peace,\r\nhe desired to have written on his tomb, “Here lies the Earl of Bute,\r\nwho, in concert with the King’s ministers, made the Peace.” A sentence\r\noften re-echoed with the ridicule it deserved, and more likely to be\r\nengraven on his monument with ignominy than approbation. The Duke of\r\nNewcastle and Lord Hardwicke censured the preliminaries, which the\r\nlatter said were worse than could have been obtained the last year;\r\nand he reflected on the assiduity with which prerogative was cried up,\r\nmore than it had been by the most ductile Parliaments. Henley the\r\nChancellor abused them both: but the fine defence of the treaty was\r\nmade by Lord Mansfield, which, he said, though he had concurred to\r\nmake, he should still retain his old connections and attachments; a\r\npromise he soon violated, with as little decency as his late friends\r\nhad censured prerogative. At ten at night the preliminaries were\r\napproved by the Lords without a division.\r\n\r\nBut it was the other House on which expectation hung. The very\r\nuncertainty whether Mr. Pitt’s health would allow him to attend,\r\nconcurred to augment the impatience of the public on so serious a\r\ncrisis. The Court, it was true, had purchased an effective number of\r\nvotes to ratify their treaty; but, could Mr. Pitt appear, he might\r\nso expose the negotiation, and give breath to such a flame, that the\r\nministers could not but be anxious till the day was decided, and they\r\nknew all that they had to apprehend from Mr. Pitt. Their hopes grew\r\nbrighter as the debate began, and he did not appear. The probability of\r\nhis absence augmented as Beckford proposed to refer the preliminaries\r\nto a committee of the whole House; a measure that seemed calculated\r\nto gain time, and that was seconded by James Grenville, who told the\r\ncourtiers that it did not look as if they were very desirous of praise,\r\nso eager were they to hurry through the question. The demand was\r\nopposed by Ellis, Sir Francis Dashwood, and Harris of Salisbury, when\r\nthe House was alarmed by a shout from without! The doors opened, and\r\nat the head of a large acclaiming concourse was seen Mr. Pitt, borne\r\nin the arms of his servants, who, setting him down within the bar, he\r\ncrawled by the help of a crutch, and with the assistance of some few\r\nfriends, to his seat; not without the sneers of some of Fox’s party. In\r\ntruth, there was a mixture of the very solemn and the theatric in this\r\napparition. The moment was so well timed, the importance of the man and\r\nhis services, the languor of his emaciated countenance, and the study\r\nbestowed on his dress, were circumstances that struck solemnity into\r\na patriot mind, and did a little furnish ridicule to the hardened and\r\ninsensible. He was dressed in black velvet, his legs and thighs wrapped\r\nin flannel, his feet covered with buskins of black cloth, and his hands\r\nwith thick gloves. He said a few words in support of the motion for\r\nsending the preliminaries to a committee; not in order to give time for\r\nraising animosities, but as it was for the dignity of the King and the\r\ncountry to weigh them maturely. Parts of the treaty, he confessed were,\r\nbeyond his expectation, good; but his mind was wounded by what regarded\r\nour trade and our allies. He wished for a committee, that he might\r\ncall merchants to the bar to state the importance of what we were to\r\nkeep, of what we were to give away. He would be convinced we were doing\r\nright, or he would _inflexibly arraign_. Legge said, he should cavil\r\nless than most men, but could not bestow approbation in the lump. Fox\r\nanswered as briefly, that nothing could ever be finished, if perfection\r\nwas insisted on. Beckford replied, that the House was as insignificant\r\nas a parliament of Paris, if treaties were not laid before them for\r\nadvice, but only for approbation; and he and Calvert laid themselves\r\nout on the defence made by the ministers, that it was the King’s\r\nprerogative to conclude peace or war; and, indeed, no occasion was\r\nlost of sounding high any branch of prerogative.\r\n\r\nThe Opposition not choosing to risk a division on the Committee,\r\nHarris, mentioned above, who was afterwards made one of the Lords of\r\nthe Treasury, moved roundly to approve the preliminaries, with the\r\naddition of words acknowledging the prerogative in question. Had the\r\ntreaty been glorious or salutary, there is no doubt but the prerogative\r\nwould not have been called in aid; a proof how distinct are prerogative\r\nand the welfare of the nation. This Harris had written some abstruse\r\nbooks on language, and possessed a good share of reputation within\r\na certain sphere. Lord Ilchester and Fox had brought him forth, and\r\nthought to make him a man of business, but he made only a very pliant\r\ncourtier and wretched orator; and in the end, attaching himself to\r\nGeorge Grenville, closed with all his arbitrary measures, and fell with\r\nhim, with no other blemish on his character than of having thought too\r\nmuch as a scholar, and too little as a senator.[277] In his motion\r\nof approbation he said, “Peace was not made for the emolument of one\r\ncountry, but of many;” a truth so home, and that recoiled so forcibly\r\non him, that it was the very reason why this country, for whose\r\nemolument it was _not_ made, ought not to have honoured it with its\r\nacceptance.\r\n\r\nStanley spoke well and handsomely in defence of the treaty; and then\r\nMr. Pitt rose. His speech it would be difficult to detail; it lasted\r\nthree hours and twenty-five minutes, and was uttered in so low and\r\nfaint a voice that it was almost impossible to hear him. At intervals\r\nhe obtained the permission of the House to speak sitting, a permission\r\nhe did not abuse; supporting himself with cordials, and having the\r\nappearance of a man determined to die in that cause and at that hour.\r\nThis faintness and the prolixity with which he dwelt on the article of\r\nthe fisheries, gave a handle to the courtiers to represent his speech\r\nas unmeasurably dull, tedious, and uninteresting. But it contained\r\nconsiderable matter, much reason, and some parts of great beauty:--but\r\nthunder was wanting to blast such a treaty, and this was not a day on\r\nwhich his genius thundered! His health or his choice had led him to\r\npresent himself as a subject of affliction to his country, and his\r\nungrateful country was not afflicted.\r\n\r\nSome passages of his speech I shall mention, though, for the reasons\r\nI have hinted at, and for that I sat at a great distance, I could but\r\nvery imperfectly collect what he said. He allowed the prerogative of\r\nthe Crown in making peace or war, though something he saw squint at\r\nwhat would subvert the liberties of this country; and, although such\r\nprerogative there was, still was it gracious to lay the Treaty before\r\nParliament. The Crown might finally sign the Treaty; but at the same\r\ntime it was a fundamental right of the House of Commons to offer their\r\nopinion. If this was not the question confessed, he would stop the\r\ndebate to insert in these words, _as it is also the indubitable and\r\nfundamental right of Parliament to offer advice_. From this he launched\r\nout on _this venerable, this lovely Constitution_, and referred to\r\nthe journals to show what answers were made by Parliament to James\r\nthe First and Charles the Second; particularly to the unkingly and\r\nunconstitutional messages of the former, as when he bade them not\r\nmeddle beyond their province, with a _ne sutor ultra crepidam_. He\r\nhoped we had no new cobbler of this old Constitution, and (looking at\r\nFox) if we had, that man should not stand unaccused, unarraigned. With\r\nregard to the peace, it could not be called a question of humanity,\r\nfor one campaign more might have prevented seven hereafter. In all\r\nother wars our commerce had been interrupted; in this alone, increased;\r\nand in respect of commerce, four of the best provinces in old France\r\nwere not worth the acquisitions we had made. Those France might have\r\nreconquered; Guadaloupe she could not retake. We had got possession\r\nof their four trades of the world. Thanks to God, General Amherst had\r\nrecovered Newfoundland! Thanks to Providence, Amherst’s brother had\r\nbehaved like _his_ brother! Thus had we secured two of those trades,\r\nthe fisheries and the sugar, all but at St. Domingo, and that we must\r\nhave taken the next campaign. Our conquests in Africa gave us the\r\nSlave Trade; and those in India the exclusive trade of the Indies.\r\n_These depended no longer on the chance of war!_ He believed there was\r\nno disunion between France and Spain; this treaty would manifestly\r\nincrease their weight: the Havannah would add to it--the Havannah!\r\nthat would have enabled you to supply Spanish America with British\r\nmanufactures and implements! He then pronounced the preliminaries\r\n_inadmissible_; declared he had thought it right to make peace when\r\nMr. Stanley went to France, and had been for the King not abusing his\r\nprosperity. But he had _proved_ that France was not in earnest _then_;\r\nhad only meant to cajole us, and deserved no management from us, after\r\nforcing us to the expense of this war, particularly by her iniquitous\r\nbehaviour in the two Courts of Madrid and Naples, a conduct never\r\nparalleled in the unbridled behaviour of Louis the Fourteenth. Yet\r\nwhy talk of Naples, which was Bourbon weakness coupled with Bourbon\r\nweakness! Obstinate, however, as himself had been in pushing forward\r\nthe war with Spain, he supposed he had been in the wrong, as nobody\r\nhad joined in sentiment with him but Lord Temple. They two were for\r\nmaking the entire maintenance of the fisheries the _sine quâ non_; but\r\nall the rest had been against them, both the old Ministers and _the\r\nfavoured Minister of this King_. Soon had it been known to France that\r\nthe exclusive fisheries would not be made a _sine quâ non_. He had\r\nnot thought that France would at once give them up, but he had held\r\nthem worth trying for for another campaign or two. Before the death\r\nof the Czarina--before the acquisition of Guadaloupe, the Havannah,\r\nand Pondicherry, the Duc de Choiseul had asked but for one rock at\r\nNewfoundland; he wished he had made his stand there, and refused,\r\nthough overwhelmed with most illiberal calumny and scurrility! He took\r\nnotice of the thousands of lives thrown away at the Havannah by their\r\nbeing sent out at so untimely a season, when the work might have been\r\ndone in the month of April; but he had retired first, when he found\r\nhe was not permitted to have the least weight. Yes, said he again,\r\nthe French had cried _Donnez nous un rocher simplement_.--I replied,\r\nI did not intend to give them the garden of Eden. But what they asked\r\nfor their _batiments pêcheurs_ extended to much more than a rock. They\r\nasked for fishing vessels, now had been given them a fishery--_en toute\r\npropriété_, in full right; I never would have granted it. Then, after\r\nexpatiating on the fisheries, he drew attention to himself, by seeming\r\nto bid adieu to politics, and to despair of his own health. He might\r\nnever come to the House again. He was unconnected, followed no party,\r\nrespected the King’s administration, though he must remonstrate when he\r\nsaw them going on fatal ground. He prayed for the House of Brunswick;\r\nstood on revolution principles alone against France; had a deep-rooted\r\nalienation from France; acted on the spirit of King William, on whose\r\nmaxims, and on the maxims on which they came thither, the House of\r\nBrunswick must rest, or could never be secure. He had seen the day on\r\nwhich every unsound maxim had been disclaimed; now saw unhappy clouds\r\ndarkening our prospect; wished the Ministers would think of these\r\nimportant matters before it was too late!\r\n\r\nHe then went through the points to be ceded in America and Africa;\r\nand declared he would not have agreed to any terms approaching to\r\nthese preliminaries. He inveighed against the bad faith of France, and\r\nshowed from their losses how much they had lain at our mercy. In the\r\ncampaign of Crevelt alone they had lost forty thousand men. Every year\r\nhad cost them twenty thousand more. Would you still treat on the same\r\nterms you would have treated, after they had put you to the expense\r\nof fourteen additional millions, and after your arms had been crowned\r\nwith such advantages? It could not be for the sake of Portugal; for you\r\nhad been told from the throne that a stop had been put to the progress\r\nof the Spaniards in that country. We must, say the French, have St.\r\nLucia, for _cela bouche Martinique_; is that a reason to be given to\r\na British Parliament? France should have given you Guadaloupe, or she\r\nand Spain, Hispaniola. She had given you more in Canada than she knew\r\nyou could use, and more than he had contended for; but then she had got\r\nthe fisheries. On the coast of Bengal we should never have suffered\r\nher to come; yet did she affect to cede all her conquests, where she\r\nhad made _none_; but, alas! no nation had ever lost an opportunity so\r\nhappy, so almost accomplished, of fixing its ascendant and commerce!\r\nHe applauded the drawing of the article of Canada, infinitely better\r\nexecuted than he could have done it. Spain, too, he owned, had\r\nacknowledged our right of cutting log-wood as fully as he could find\r\nany authority in our records to contend for; but the negotiators had\r\nnot been equally able, in fixing Spain, to acknowledge our right of\r\nfishery in Newfoundland. Spain does not renounce her right of fishing\r\nthere, but desists. For the King of Prussia he was disavowed! given up!\r\nsacrificed! so melancholy was the effect of the coldness that was grown\r\nbetween the two crowns! The branches of Bourbon were united; we and\r\nour allies disunited! He had seen nothing he envied in French councils\r\ntill now. They had indulged a noble delicacy of honour, and obtained\r\neverything for Spain; nay, had treated Austria with punctilio. We did\r\nnot so remember those who had served us! The moment the battle of\r\nCulloden should be forgotten, this country would be undone! We ought to\r\nhave made a family compact with the King of Prussia.\r\n\r\nStanley said a few words on his own part in the negotiation; and then\r\nMr. Fox rising to speak, Pitt, in contempt or exhausted, retired out\r\nof the house, attended by redoubled huzzas! the mob re-echoing the\r\nduration of his speech, “Three hours and a half! three hours and a\r\nhalf!”\r\n\r\nThe secession of Pitt struck such a damp on Opposition, that Fox had\r\nbut little to do but to chant _Te Deum_ for victory. He said little,\r\nvery little, in behalf of the treaty, to which success was now ensured.\r\nHe rather painted his own situation, and that of parties, ranking\r\nhimself with the Whigs, but affecting to believe a general union of\r\nall factions under the King. He had been called out, he said, when men\r\nwould have revived those distinctions, and torn the Tories from the\r\nsupport of the Crown. No desire did he know of extending prerogative;\r\nif it had been exerted unduly in signing the preliminaries, Ministers\r\nwere answerable; but he vowed to God he did not know that it was in the\r\nmind of any man to enlarge the prerogative. Mr. Pitt had thought we\r\ncould have gone on much longer, and that France could not; he himself\r\nthought we could not have gone on much longer: but what had Mr. Pitt\r\ngiven, except assertions in support of his persuasion? He himself had\r\nbeen told that our commerce was declined. If England would apply itself\r\nto improve this peace, it would turn out the greatest that ever had\r\nbeen made.\r\n\r\nCharles Townshend, discontent, expecting much severe animadversion\r\non the treaty, and dreading to differ with Mr. Pitt when the latter\r\nwas likely to exert all his powers, had come to the House prepared\r\nto arraign the preliminaries. Finding his mistake, and secure by the\r\nretreat of Pitt, he changed his battery, defended the peace as well\r\nas it could be defended, burned incense on the altar of prerogative,\r\nand sang almost hosannahs to the praise of the King. It happened the\r\nnext day that Dempster, commending Mr. Pitt, and calling him the\r\n_arch-patriot_, Rigby said, Mr. Pitt, it was true, had spoken three\r\nhours and a half, but an _archer-patriot_ had said more to the purpose\r\nin twenty-five minutes.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Newcastle had sent to his friends not to divide; on which\r\nthey retired. This not being known to the Duke of Cumberland, his\r\nadherents stayed, and two of his own servants, Lord Ancram[278]\r\nand General Fitzwilliam,[279] were in the minority--which were but\r\nsixty-five against three hundred and nineteen. The Duke was angry that\r\nhis people had been left alone: on which it was resolved to rally\r\non the Report, but with no better success; the Court were still two\r\nhundred and twenty-seven to sixty-three, Lord Royston, Lord Hardwicke’s\r\nson, being of the majority.\r\n\r\nNothing can paint the importance of this victory to the Court so\r\nstrongly as what the Princess of Wales said, on the news of the\r\npreliminaries being carried: “Now,” said she, “my son _is_ King of\r\nEngland.” The ministers ordered that the numbers on the question should\r\nbe printed--had they printed the names too, the world would have known\r\nthe names of the sixty-five that were _not_ bribed.\r\n\r\nFox having thus successfully employed rewards, thought the time was\r\ncome for making use of the other weapon of government--punishment.\r\nA more severe political persecution never raged. Whoever, holding a\r\nplace, had voted against the preliminaries, was instantly dismissed.\r\nThe friends[280] and dependents of the Duke of Newcastle were\r\nparticularly cashiered; and this cruelty was extended so far, that old\r\nservants, who had retired and been preferred to very small places, were\r\nrigorously hunted out and deprived of their livelihood. An inquisition\r\nwas held at Fox’s house; and a despotic spirit prevailed so rudely,\r\nthat Lady Elizabeth Waldegrave,[281] sister of the Duchess of Bedford,\r\nand a notable politician, desired to be admitted to the junto of\r\nproscription.\r\n\r\nIn particular, Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Earle[282] were dismissed from\r\nthe Board of Ordnance for their votes; as was the younger Thomas\r\nTownshend[283] from the green cloth, without the smallest notification.\r\nSome were even sacrificed who had given no offence, as the worthy\r\nAdmiral Forbes,[284] who was removed from the Admiralty to make room\r\nfor Cotes, of the same profession and a friend of Fox. Schutz, who\r\nhad been seven years of the King’s bedchamber, was turned out, for no\r\nreason but that he had not a seat in Parliament, and could be of no use\r\nthere.[285]\r\n\r\nBut to wind up the year with more dignified rigour, the Dukes of\r\nNewcastle and Grafton and the Marquis of Rockingham were dismissed from\r\nthe Lieutenancies of their several counties.[286] The same affront\r\nbeing designed for the Duke of Devonshire, Fox affected to make a point\r\nof saving him; but the Duke, with proper spirit, scorned to be obliged\r\nto him, and resigned to accompany his friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n  Death of John Earl Granville.--His character.--Political\r\n    persecution originating in Fox.--Want of cordiality in the\r\n    Ministerial League between him and Bute.--Attack on Patent\r\n    Places.--Lord Northington and Sir Fletcher Norton.--The Duke of\r\n    Cumberland’s remark on the harsh proceedings of Fox.--Triumph of\r\n    the Court.--Wilkes and Churchill.--Favour shown to the friends\r\n    of the Stuarts.--Observance of the Jacobite fast.--Calvert’s\r\n    extraordinary Speech.--Sir John Philipps’s Motion for the Accounts\r\n    of the Nation.--Folly of the Tories.--Committee to inspect\r\n    Madhouses.--Accounts of the Navy.--Calamities of War.--No\r\n    famous _native_ Generals except Wolfe and Lord Clive.--Charles\r\n    Townshend’s fickle Politics.--The Standing Army.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Earl Granville, the antagonist of one Prime Minister, Prime\r\nMinister himself, and then assistant to every succeeding Prime\r\nMinister, died on the second day of the new year. The rhodomontade, to\r\nwhich he was addicted, was set off by parts and wit, or forgiven to his\r\ngood-humour. It was very unlike the presumptuous ascendant of Pitt,\r\nor the lofty ignorance of Lord Bute. Pitt, unsociable and muffled in\r\nclouds, was adored from the terror imprinted by his lightnings. Bute\r\nthought distance and obscurity sufficient characteristics of divinity;\r\nbut Granville, like Bacchus, rattled his car among men, and was but\r\nthe more admired the more he familiarized himself with mortals. He\r\nhad fallen unpitied, but unhated; and sank in rank without sinking\r\nin esteem, his fall having lessened him less than his exaltation. He\r\nseemed so proper for every part, that in him it did not seem mean to be\r\nsecond, after commanding.[287]\r\n\r\nThe persecution, set on foot at the end of the last year, was kept up\r\nwith unrelaxed severity.[288] A place of 200_l._ a year was taken from\r\nMr. Legge’s nephew,[289] a boy at school: and another of the same value\r\nfrom a man in Sussex, who had been rewarded with it for service done\r\nagainst an inhuman set of smugglers, by the interest of the late Duke\r\nof Grafton, whom Fox had hated. In truth, these hardships were not only\r\nsuggested by Fox, but now and then executed without the knowledge of\r\nthe Favourite, who often disclaimed[290] them, and sometimes, to load\r\nhis associate, made recompense to the parties aggrieved; for though\r\nthey became heartier friends afterwards, and though the Favourite bore\r\ntestimony, in a subsequent period, that Fox was the only man who had\r\nnot deceived him, it is pretty sure that their ministerial league was\r\nfar from cordial; not quite sure that Bute did not deceive Fox; and\r\ncertain, that the King betrayed symptoms of satisfaction on hearing\r\nthat the blame of all this violence fell on Fox.\r\n\r\nHe had meditated going still greater lengths. Lord Lincoln, whom he\r\nparticularly hated, was Auditor of the Exchequer for life, the amplest\r\nsinecure in England, except the Archbishoprick of Canterbury. Some\r\nother great patent-places were held by men then in Opposition. Fox\r\nhimself enjoyed a very considerable one in Ireland; yet so much did\r\nhis thirst of vengeance surmount his interest, that a question was\r\nput to the Chancellor, whether the King could not take away patents\r\nbestowed in former reigns, and whether the case might not be laid\r\nbefore the twelve Judges. The Chancellor, who had fits of bluntness and\r\nhonesty, or prophetically affectionate to grants for life, so profusely\r\nheaped on him afterwards, replied, “Yes, they might lay the idea\r\nbefore the Judges, and then refer Magna Charta to them afterwards, to\r\ndecide on that too.” Norton, Solicitor-General, as bold and as blunt,\r\nbut never as honest as Lord Northington, being consulted to the same\r\npoint, advised to take away the places, and then see if the law would\r\nrestore them. This man now rose from obscure infamy to that infamous\r\nfame which long will stick to him. It was known that in private causes\r\nhe took money from both parties, and availed himself against one or\r\nother of them of the lights they had communicated to him.[291] Yet\r\nhis abilities were so good, and his knowledge so great, that no man\r\nhad more extensive practice in Westminster Hall. In Parliament he had\r\nfor some years been disregarded; but his foul tongue and causidical\r\nboldness, his clearness in argument or facility in assertion, his\r\nattachment to Lord Mansfield, and his total alienation from all\r\nprinciple, offered him as a proper tool to a Court that was to wade\r\nthrough the letter of the law to the demolition of the spirit. Yet\r\nhis authority alone could not encourage such a violation of justice\r\nas had now been in agitation. The Favourite, too, and the Favourite’s\r\nfavourites, might think it more eligible to leave patent places\r\nunmolested; they must have coveted them more than they could wish, to\r\nrender them precarious.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland, on these harsh proceedings, said to Lord\r\nWaldegrave, “Fox has deceived me grossly--not, as you think, by\r\ngiving me up; he might be as angry with me for talking to Newcastle\r\nand Pitt--but he has deceived me, for I thought him good-natured;\r\nbut in all these transactions he has shown the bitterest revenge and\r\ninhumanity.”\r\n\r\nWhen the Houses met after Christmas, the Court was so thoroughly the\r\nmaster, that scarce an attempt was made at opposition. Yet Wilkes and\r\nChurchill wrote with as much intemperance as if the nation had been\r\noverspread with the flame of faction. The latter now published his\r\n“Prophecy of Famine,” one of the severest and least irregular of his\r\nworks. Their poems and libels seemed to have little effect, but the\r\nseeds sown by them took deep root. Nor did the Court trouble itself to\r\ndeny what was charged on it. The measures of the House of Stuart were\r\nso thoroughly copied, that even the rankest friends of that family were\r\nadopted at St. James’s. Sir John Philipps himself was made a privy\r\ncouncillor.\r\n\r\nIt happened that Lord Strange,[292] moving a common adjournment to the\r\nfollowing Monday, the Speaker said the House must adjourn till Tuesday,\r\nfor Monday would be the 30th of January. Lord Strange laughed at such a\r\nSaint’s day, and divided the House, but found only thirty-six persons\r\nof his opinion; one hundred and three were for observing the ridiculous\r\nfast. Fox was of the majority, who, very few years before, had been\r\nfor putting an end to that Jacobite holiday--a clear indication of the\r\nprinciples of the new Court. Lord Strange causing that part of the act\r\nof Parliament, which ordains observance of the day, to be read, and\r\naffirming that the words _Neither Parliament nor People can judge the\r\nKing_, were contrary to the constitution; Fox denied it, and maintained\r\nthat the constitution had always held that language. Rose Fuller and\r\nLord Strange moved another day, to abolish the observation of the\r\npretended martyrdom, but it was overruled by the House: however, it\r\nproduced a very bold and extraordinary speech from Calvert; he drew a\r\npicture of a fictitious family in Surrey, whom he called _the Steadys_,\r\ndescribing two old Steadys and a young one; with a very particular\r\naccount of young Steady’s mother, and of her improper intimacy\r\nwith a Scotch gardener--he hoped the true friends of young _Steady_\r\nwould advise him to recall his old friends, and turn away the Scotch\r\ngardener. No reply was made, for none could be made, without carrying\r\nthe application too home.\r\n\r\nMost of the other transactions of this session were as trifling, and\r\ndeserve but little notice. Sir John Philipps, to preserve a semblance\r\nof patriotism, or instigated by Bute to intimidate Newcastle, moved for\r\nthe accounts of the nation. Fox, who did not like any clue that might\r\nlead to the mysteries of the Pay-Office, opposed it; and Lord Granby,\r\nthough sold to the Court, warmly defended the Duke of Newcastle’s\r\nintegrity. Legge objected, too, and said he saw no end such a motion\r\ntended to; it was like asking a country fellow the way--he always asks\r\nyou whence you came! Aislabie[293] reflected on Fox for not passing his\r\naccounts, and the attack was received with loud marks of approbation;\r\nbut when neither the late nor actual ministers encouraged the inquiry,\r\nit was not likely to be very successful. Sir John Philipps accordingly\r\ndesisted, and Sir Francis Dashwood proposed to name a select committee\r\nto examine any accounts that had been brought in, which was agreed to;\r\nand lists were given out, from whence an equal number being chosen of\r\nthe Court’s and of Newcastle’s friends, no more came of this, than\r\nof twenty such intended inquiries. Nor was anything memorable in\r\nthe outset, but that the Tories, meeting in a body to consider the\r\nproposed lists, erased the names of Fox’s four chief friends; still,\r\nso blind were those dull men to their real interest, and still so much\r\naddicted to be led by mere names, they even objected to the large\r\narmy proposed to be maintained; proof that they had not one sensible\r\nman of their body. What should a large army achieve but the work of\r\nmonarchy? Or say the Tories were honest men and lovers of liberty?\r\nCould they love liberty and slavery both? or did they call themselves\r\nby a disgraceful name when they deserved to wear an honourable one? In\r\ntruth, all the sensible Tories I ever knew were either Jacobites or\r\nbecame Whigs; those that remained Tories remained fools.\r\n\r\nA scheme more laudable, more necessary, and founded on a crying evil,\r\nmet with no fairer success than the committee of accounts. I mean the\r\ncommittee to inspect and redress the grievous abuses of madhouses.[294]\r\nCharles Townshend took great pains in that business, distinguished\r\nhimself, was content and dropped it. The lawyers raised many\r\nobjections, and removed none. Poor humanity! how ill art thou treated\r\nby the human race! We fire at the relation of calamities, denounce\r\nvengeance on the perpetrators, cry out for, set about, reformation,\r\nand in England, give us our due, lavish our money towards it; then\r\ngrow cool, and never think of the woe afterwards. Lawyers never suffer\r\ncorrection of abuses; they defend them even where they do not commit\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhen the accounts of the navy were brought into the House, it appeared\r\nthat one hundred and eighty-four thousand seamen had been raised during\r\nthe war. Of these, one hundred and thirty thousand had been lost to\r\nthe nation; and yet, scarce will it be believed, sixteen hundred only\r\nhad been killed![295] Many had deserted, and had enlisted again;\r\nothers went into other services. Most of the rest died of distempers,\r\nclimates, hardships, &c. But with the loss of sixteen hundred men, we\r\nhad destroyed the navies of France and Spain. Glorious consideration!\r\ncould it be unmixed with the remembrance of the other hundred and\r\ntwenty-eight thousand! But Glory must shed more tears of anguish than\r\nof joy, whenever she turns accomptant. What if returns were made of all\r\nthe other lives lost in that war all over the face of the globe! What\r\ndid the peasants in Germany suffer? even heroism had its pangs. Did not\r\nthe King of Prussia see every general with whom he commenced that short\r\nwar perish before his eyes? I said he felt a pang--I hope he did. It\r\nis an observation a little foreign to the reflection with which I set\r\nout, but extensively victorious as that war was to Britain, she did not\r\nsee one famous _native_ general arise out of that war, except Wolfe,\r\nwho died in the cradle of his celebrity; and unless we name Lord Clive,\r\nwho was more a statesman than general, and in both respects not matched\r\nagainst equal rivals. I do not mean to detract from his merits; he was\r\nborn to shine in the Indies: at home he never stepped beyond the common\r\nof mankind.\r\n\r\nCharles Townshend, who had but just resigned, and who had no sooner\r\nresigned than he opposed the opposition, perceiving the weakness of\r\nthat opposition, that Pitt would not lead it, and afraid to lead it\r\nhimself, struck in again with the tide, and at the end of February\r\nkissed hands for first Lord of Trade, with a nominal rank of Cabinet\r\nCouncillor, but without being permitted to go in to the King with\r\nstate papers, except with those relating to the Board of Trade. He had\r\nboasted of far greater offers. Lord Sandys was removed to make room for\r\nhim. A promiscuous meeting being held at Sir Francis Dashwood’s, to\r\nconsider what proportion of army should be kept up, Ellis, Secretary\r\nat War, proposed eighteen thousand men for England, ten for America,\r\nand the usual twelve thousand for Ireland; but hinted at raising six\r\nthousand more for the latter kingdom; which Fox said the King desired.\r\nSir Charles Mordaunt, a chief Tory, said he had great duty for the\r\nKing, but could not consent to that augmentation. Charles Townshend\r\nseconded his refusal, and it was given up.\r\n\r\nLord Strange said the King must know what force was wanting, and if\r\nnecessary it must be granted; but if the King would give it up, it\r\nshowed it was not necessary; and therefore himself should be for the\r\nlesser number. Sir John Philipps, Lord George Sackville, and Rigby\r\ntried in Parliament to obtain the additional six thousand, but could\r\nnot carry the point, though they endeavoured to prove that the King was\r\nnot limited by the act of King William to but twelve thousand men in\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Pitt’s opinion on the Army Reductions.--Address to the King.--\r\n    Symptoms of disunion among Ministers.--Fox’s rage.--Apprehensive\r\n    of treachery, he seeks to propitiate his old connections.--Sir\r\n    Francis Dashwood’s Budget.--Tax on Cider.--Discussion on Ways\r\n    and Means.--Pitt and George Grenville.--Ardent opposition to the\r\n    Cider-tax.--Petition from Newfoundland.--Humiliation of Fox.--\r\n    Debate in the House of Lords on the Cider-bill.--Passing of the\r\n    Bill.--Lord Bute’s alarm.--His resignation.--Its effect on\r\n    Fox.--George Grenville first Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor\r\n    of the Exchequer.--Removal of Sir Francis Dashwood.--Ministerial\r\n    changes and promotions.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the day came for voting the army, Mr. Pitt attended. He approved\r\nthe measure, he said, as far as it went, but wished more troops were\r\nallotted to America. That he had a very different opinion from many\r\nof the peace: thought it hollow and insecure, _and that it would not\r\nlast ten years_. He showed no acrimony to Fox, he and Lord Temple both\r\nseeming more hostile to Lord Bute; but he dropped, that if any body\r\nwould point out the right way to inquire what was the cause of so many\r\ndismissions, he would second the motion. Beckford having wished the\r\narmy more reduced, Pitt said, such reductions had hurt us formerly.\r\nAfter the peace of Ryswick the army was lessened to seven thousand; but\r\nwar followed in three years. After the treaty of Utrecht, but eight\r\nthousand men were kept up, but that reduction produced a rebellion\r\nand an army of fifteen thousand. Charles Townshend, dreading the lash\r\nof Pitt on his late inconsistencies, retired early in the debate; but\r\nthe General, his brother, just arrived from Portugal, was lavish in\r\nencomiums on the peace and peacemakers.\r\n\r\nIn a few days after, Beckford, seconded by Pitt, moved to address the\r\nKing to prefer officers on half-pay to those whose commissions were\r\nfresher; and though Fox and the ministers objected, it was suffered to\r\npass. Sir Henry Erskine in the course of the debate frequently sounding\r\nthe King’s name, Mr. Pitt severely reprimanded the Speaker for not\r\nstopping him.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of these debates, it was observed, that at least the\r\nFavourite’s faction, if not himself, were hostile to Fox. On the\r\ncommittee of accounts, Elliot and Lord North had been so personal\r\nto him, that he lost his temper; and Beckford desiring him to save\r\nappearances, he replied, he never minded appearances, but--he was going\r\nto say, realities, when a loud burst of laughter from the whole House\r\ninterrupted him. His rage was so great, that, sitting down, he said\r\nto Onslow,[296] though an enemy, “Did you ever see a man so treated\r\nin my situation? but, by G--, I will have an explanation and ample\r\nsubmission, or I will never set my foot in this House again.” Another\r\nsymptom of disunion was, that Lord Ravensworth[297] having moved for\r\nthe whole accounts of the war, Lord Hardwicke said it was impossible\r\nto produce them yet; the paymaster had a deputy abroad who could not\r\nhave made them up. This being understood as a reflection on Fox, Lord\r\nHardwicke said, on the contrary, he had meant to vindicate him. Lord\r\nTalbot concurred with this explanation; adding, “Nobody can imagine\r\nthat _I_ want to screen Mr. Fox;” an expression warmly taken up by Lord\r\nHilsborough, one of Fox’s friends.\r\n\r\nIf Lord Bute countenanced these hostilities, it was but consonant to\r\nthe folly of his character. Fox had boldness and wickedness enough\r\nto undertake whatever the Court wished to compass. Fox seemed so\r\napprehensive of treachery, that he cast about to recover his old\r\nconnections. By Lord Albemarle, Lord Frederick Cavendish,[298] and Lord\r\nWaldegrave, he laboured to be reconciled to the Duke of Cumberland and\r\nthe Duke of Devonshire. He asked Lord Waldegrave if the former was\r\nstill incensed against him. The other replied, he had not heard the\r\nDuke mention him of late, but supposed his Royal Highness could not be\r\nignorant how much he had been abused by Murphy, known to write under\r\nFox’s direction. “Formerly he did so,” said Fox, “but I had not seen\r\nhim in a year and a half, till _hearing_ how violent the ‘Auditors’\r\nwere, I sent for him and stopped them;”--an excuse too weak _for_ a\r\nsensible man to make _to_ a sensible man _through_ a sensible man. Lord\r\nWaldegrave suspected that Fox’s views went deeper than reconciliation;\r\nfor shortly after this conversation Rigby came to the Earl, and sounded\r\nhim whether he would not take the Treasury, Lord Bute, he said, not\r\nbeing able to stand his ground. As Lord Waldegrave had married my\r\nniece,[299] I knew all these intrigues from him, and was actually in\r\nhis house at the time of this overture, of which he immediately told\r\nme with an expressive smile, which in him, who never uttered a bitter\r\nword, conveyed the essence of sense and satire.\r\n\r\nWe must now quit Fox, to make room for a doughty hero of more comic\r\ncast, the Chancellor of the Exchequer.[300] Hitherto he had but just\r\nacted enough as minister, to show that he neither was one nor was fit\r\nto be one. The time was now come for _opening the budget_, when it was\r\nincumbent on him to state the finances, debts, and calls of Government;\r\nand to chalk out a plan of proper supplies. All this he performed so\r\nawkwardly, with so little intelligence or clearness, in so vulgar a\r\ntone, and in such mean language, that he, who had been esteemed a plain\r\ncountry gentleman of good sense, said himself afterwards, “People will\r\npoint at me, and cry, _there goes the worst Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\nthat ever appeared_!” His famous measure was the tax on cider; and\r\nwhoever would know more of his ability in conducting that business,\r\nwill find it amply detailed in the North-Britons; a coarse and satiric\r\npicture, yet but little exaggerated. The tax itself deserves far more\r\nthan the author of it to live in the memory of English history, for the\r\ncrisis it occasioned or drove on.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion of these ways and means, George Grenville complained\r\nthat men objected to laying burthens on the sinking fund, and called\r\nrather for new taxes. He wished gentlemen would show him _where_ to\r\nlay them. Repeating this question in his querulous, languid, fatiguing\r\ntone, Pitt, who sat opposite to him, mimicking his accent aloud,\r\nrepeated these words of an old ditty--_Gentle shepherd, tell me\r\nwhere!_ and then rising, abused Grenville bitterly. He had no sooner\r\nfinished than Grenville started up in a transport of rage, and said,\r\nif gentlemen were to be treated with that contempt--Pitt was walking\r\nout of the House, but at that word turned round, made a sneering bow\r\nto Grenville and departed. The latter had provoked him by stating the\r\nprofusions of the war. There is use in recording this anecdote: the\r\nappellation of _The Gentle Shepherd_ long stuck by Grenville; he is\r\nmentioned by it in many of the writings on the stamp act, and in other\r\npamphlets and political prints of the time.\r\n\r\nThe tax on cider raised a great flame in the western counties, and\r\nby management, that flame was transported to the metropolis. All the\r\nwestern members, however, attached to the Court, could not avoid\r\ndefending the interests of their constituents; and thus joining what\r\nstanding Opposition there was, the minority often divided near 120:\r\nand as every step of the bill was ardently fought, divisions happened\r\nfrequently, and threw a kind of vivacity into the session. In the city\r\nSir William Baker acted strenuously against the Court, and Wilkes’s pen\r\nwas never idle.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Fox received another humiliation. He had received a\r\npetition for relief from the sufferers at Newfoundland. It was objected\r\nto from all quarters of the House: general indemnification could not\r\nbe made to all the sufferers by the war, why then partial? Sir Francis\r\nDashwood, Lord Barrington, and Nugent supported Fox faintly; Ellis\r\nand Rigby warmly; Lord George Sackville with panegyric, for which he\r\nwas reproved by Lord Strange, who, with G. Grenville, Stanley, and\r\nLord Frederick Campbell, treated Fox and his petition harshly. During\r\nthis altercation Lord Middleton, casting his eye over the paper,\r\nobserved that all the names to the petition were signed by the same\r\nhand. This occasioned such an uproar, that Fox was obliged to ask\r\npardon, and withdraw the petition, pleading, that the paper had been\r\nwritten out fair from the original, which had really been signed by\r\nthe petitioners. In private, he said that there had been a paragraph\r\nnot worded with sufficient respect to the House, which occasioned his\r\nhaving the petition copied out by a clerk, and there had not been time\r\nto get it signed again; but he stood so ill in the public eye, that\r\nwhatever he did received the worst construction.\r\n\r\nMarch 28th. The Cider-bill had now laboured through the Commons, and\r\nwas read for the second time by the Lords. Lord Hardwicke spoke and\r\nvoted against it; but was answered well, and with severity, by Lord\r\nMarchmont.[301] Lord Mansfield made a bad trimming speech, but voted\r\nfor the bill. Lord Lyttelton[302] spoke well against it. Lord Pomfret\r\nheaped panegyrics on the Favourite, whose own speech was languid and\r\nunargumentative. The Tory Lords who belong chiefly to the western\r\ncounties were most of them against the bill, as were nine of the\r\nBishops; but the bill was committed by a majority of 71 to 39.\r\n\r\nIt was read the third time on the 30th, and was attacked with energy by\r\nthe Duke of Grafton; by Lord Dartmouth[303] with decency and propriety;\r\nby Lord Lyttelton, though with censures on the political pamphlets of\r\nthe time; and by the Duke of Newcastle, who complimented the rising\r\ngeneration. It having been reported that, on hearing the City would\r\npetition the King against the bill, as they had both Houses, on the\r\nground of the bill being calculated to extend the excise, Lord Bute\r\nhad sent word to the leading men of the City, that if they would drop\r\ntheir petition, the bill should be repealed the next session, he\r\nthought it necessary to explain the foundation of that report; he had\r\nonly sent word, he said, that if the bill proved a bad one, which he\r\ndid not believe it would, he would try to get it repealed. This was\r\none of his best speeches, though not divested of pomp, and with much\r\naffected contempt of popularity. Lord Ravensworth expressed great scorn\r\nof the City assuming the dictatorial tone. Lord Denbigh was still\r\nmore bitter, and spoke with so much wit and applause that in very\r\nfew days he was made a Lord of the Bedchamber. Lord Temple having in\r\nboth debates been very personal to the Favourite, and having declared\r\nin favour of excise, as Lord Bute had against it, Lord Denbigh said\r\nhe hoped the King, to please the City, would remove the Minister who\r\nwas against excise, and place that Lord who was for it at the head\r\nof the Treasury. The bill was passed, sixty-two lords being for it,\r\nthirty-eight against it. After the first debate, the Lords Oxford,\r\nFoley, and Willoughby protested; the first and last of the King’s\r\nbedchamber. After the second debate, the Duke of Bolton,[304] Earl\r\nTemple, and Lord Fortescue protested.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the House rose the Sheriffs hurried to St. James’s;\r\nand, though at so unusual an hour, and without having previously asked\r\nleave, presented to the King a petition not to pass the bill; but he\r\npassed it the very next morning.\r\n\r\nFew political clouds seemed less big with mischief than this storm,\r\nunnaturally conjured up, and little likely to last; for what principle\r\nof union could there be in common between the City of London and two\r\nor three distant counties whose apples were to be taxed? The spell,\r\n_excise_, was pronounced, but had lost its terrors. They who sounded\r\nloudest the alarm, neither were alarmed, nor expected to breathe much\r\ndread into others. But there was a frame of nerves more easily thrown\r\ninto disorder; fear seized on the Favourite; he said, “We shall have\r\nthirty thousand men come down to St. James’s!” The assault that had\r\nbeen made on him the first day of the session had left a lasting\r\nimpression; and he had showed, early in the reign, that fortitude\r\nwas not a ruling ingredient in his composition. He had appointed\r\nhimself a guard of bruisers the day of his attending the King into the\r\nCity in 1761, when Mr. Pitt made his insolent parade thither at the\r\nsame time. Now, bating the slight distemperature occasioned by the\r\ncider-tax, England seemed to be willingly, and submissively, prostrate\r\nat the Favourite’s feet. Would she have rebelled for a partial tax,\r\nafter acquiescing in the peace? Fear does not calculate, but lumps\r\napprehensions in the gross. The panic was taken, and on the 7th of\r\nApril, to the surprise of mankind, it was notified that Lord Bute\r\nintended to resign the next day, and to retire for his health, not\r\nbeing able to go through the fatigue of business.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that he had at times declared, that as soon as he had made\r\nthe peace, he would quit his post; but few had heard the declaration,\r\nand fewer believed it. The Ministers knew nothing of his intention\r\ntill the day before it was publicly notified; and Fox was so entirely\r\nout of the secret, that he reproached the Earl bitterly for leaving\r\nhim in that ignorance and dilemma. The Favourite’s own speeches in\r\nParliament expressing a wish of retirement had rather confirmed men\r\nin the opinion that he had no thoughts of it. No one act had had the\r\nleast air of his giving up his power, nor had any measures been taken\r\nto replace him or carry on the present system; but the best comment on\r\nhis behaviour at that moment was his subsequent conduct. The fondness\r\nhe retained for power, his intrigues to preserve it, the confusion he\r\nhelped to throw into almost every succeeding system, and his impotent\r\nand dark attempts to hang on the wheels of Government, which he only\r\nclogged, and to which he dreaded even being suspected of recommending\r\ndrivers, all proved that neither virtue nor philosophy had the honour\r\nof dictating his retreat; but that fear, and fear only, was the\r\nimmediate, inconsiderate, and precipitate cause of his resignation.[305]\r\n\r\nYet let me not be thought to lament this weak man’s pusillanimity. I am\r\ncondemning his want of policy, but rejoice at it. Had he been firm to\r\nhimself, there was an end of the constitution! The hearts of Englishmen\r\nwere corrupt and sold, and the best heads amongst them toiled in the\r\ncause of Despotism. A happy panic blew up the system of absolute\r\npower when it had lasted but five months; and a trifling Opposition\r\noverturned in a fortnight the work of that majority which a fortnight\r\nhad purchased. Yet the struggle was not over. The rod fell into abler\r\nand more resolute hands; the mercenaries were not disbanded, though the\r\ncommander-in-chief ran away. Fortunately he became incompatible with\r\nhis successors; and liberty owed its salvation, not to its friends, but\r\nto discord among the conspirators.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned how utterly Fox was disconcerted at this unexpected\r\nresignation. His first movement was to press Lord Bute to retain the\r\nTreasury, at least for six months. That attempt was fruitless. His\r\nnext step was to secure his own peerage. Again was he astonished to be\r\ntold that he had agreed to cede the Pay-office on going into the House\r\nof Lords. This he peremptorily denied. But he had dealt with a worthy\r\npupil of his own. Lord Shelburne, who had negotiated between him and\r\nLord Bute, when Fox undertook the conduct of the House of Commons,\r\nhad told the Earl that Fox would quit the Pay-office for a peerage;\r\nbut Fox had only stipulated to give his support for that reward. He\r\nnow broke out against his scholar, reproached him for concealing Lord\r\nBute’s intention of retiring, and spoke of Shelburne to everybody\r\n_as a perfidious and infamous liar_; those were his usual words. The\r\nprobability was, that Shelburne intended to slip into the Pay-office\r\nhimself. The Favourite, who would have declared Fox his successor,\r\nexcused Lord Shelburne to him, and, in his pedantic style, called the\r\nsecrecy he had observed _a pious fraud_; for Fox, he said, he knew\r\nwould not have engaged in the management of the Parliament, had he been\r\napprized that he (Bute) intended to retire, and it had been necessary\r\nto the King’s affairs that Fox should carry them through the session.\r\nThis very offer of the Treasury to Fox showed how little the Favourite\r\nhad taken any measures for carrying on his master’s business for the\r\nfuture, and corroborates the presumption that a sudden panic was the\r\nimmediate cause of his retreat.\r\n\r\nFox refusing to accept them, the post of First Lord of the Treasury and\r\nthe Seals of Chancellor of the Exchequer were, on April 8, the very\r\nday on which the Favourite resigned, bestowed on George Grenville. Sir\r\nFrancis Dashwood was removed to the Great Wardrobe; and the barony of\r\nDespencer, then in abeyance between him and his nephew, Sir Thomas\r\nStapleton, was granted to him: the one to repair, the other to decorate\r\nhis fall.\r\n\r\nSome other promotions were made of the Favourite’s and Fox’s adherents;\r\nand, to strengthen the new system, many favours were heaped on the\r\nDuke of Bedford’s dependents. Of the first sorts was the preferment\r\nof Oswald to be Vice-Treasurer of Ireland; of Hunter[306] and Harris\r\nto the Treasury; of Lord Digby[307] to the Admiralty; to which board\r\nwere added, by Grenville, Lord Howe[308] and young Thomas Pitt.[309]\r\nThe Earl of Northumberland was named to the chief government of\r\nIreland, which had been offered to, and refused by, Lord Granby,\r\nwho, as I hinted before, was now appointed Master of the Ordnance;\r\nfrom which old Marshal Ligonier was by force removed, but softened\r\nwith a pension, which he refused to accept till accompanied with an\r\nEnglish peerage. General Townshend,[310] though only a Major-General,\r\nwas made Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance; Lord Harcourt[311]\r\nreplaced Lord Northumberland as Chamberlain to the Queen; and, in the\r\nroom of the former, Lord Weymouth was made her Master of the Horse.\r\nThe Duke of Queensberry[312] succeeded the deceased Lord Tweedale\r\nas Justice-General of Scotland: the Seal was given to the Duke of\r\nAthol,[313] and the Privy Seal to Mr. Mackenzie, the Favourite’s\r\nbrother. John Pitt[314] was turned out to make room for Sir Edmund\r\nThomas.[315] Lord March[316] and Lord Cathcart[317] obtained green\r\nribands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n  The Bedford Faction.--Ambition of the Duchess of Bedford.--The\r\n    Dukes of Marlborough and Rutland.--Lord Gower.--Fox raised to the\r\n    Peerage.--Ingratitude of his friends, particularly of Calcraft and\r\n    Rigby.--Mr. (afterwards Sir Charles) Bunbury.--Lord Hertford and\r\n    Mr. Conway.--Charles Townshend’s presumption.--Reversions granted\r\n    by Lord Bute.--Walpole’s feelings towards that Minister.--His\r\n    Political acts.--Death of Lord Waldegrave.--His character.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bedford faction were not to be contented with empty honours or\r\nslight emoluments. They sent for their Duke from France, who, to grasp\r\nthe more by seeming moderation, resigned the Privy Seal, as most men\r\nthought, with views on the Treasury itself; at least, his squadron\r\nvaunted that they had two or three administrations in readiness before\r\nthe King should be obliged to employ the Opposition. The Favourite,\r\nfrom the first moment of his power, had made it a point to gratify,\r\nnay, to outrun, the Duke of Bedford’s largest wishes. Nothing he had\r\nasked, nothing his creatures were immodest enough to demand, had\r\nbeen denied; yet Lord Bute was balked in his hopes of purchasing\r\nthe attachment of that connection--not from their usual perfidy; he\r\nhad lost them before they suspected the smallest diminution of his\r\nomnipotence. He had not gratified the ambition of the Duchess.[318] She\r\nhad marked for herself the first post in the Queen’s family; but with\r\nmore attention to her pride than to her interest, had forborne to ask\r\nit, concluding it must be offered to her. The Princess and Lord Bute,\r\neither not suspecting, or glad to be ignorant of her views, were far\r\nenough from seeking to place so dangerous a woman in the very heart\r\nof the palace. This neglect the Duchess deeply resented, and never\r\nforgave. She was even so weak as to declare that inveteracy in a letter\r\nto her sister, Lady Elizabeth Waldegrave, from Paris; which Lord Bute\r\nintercepting, there first learned what an aspic was lodged near his\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\nBut though the Favourite, persuaded of the Duchess’s implacability,\r\ndropped all correspondence with that faction, he was far from checking\r\nthe stream of the Crown’s graces towards them. The King begged the\r\nsupport of the Duke of Marlborough,[319] and offered to make him Master\r\nof the Horse, if the Duke of Rutland[320] could be induced to part with\r\nit. The latter consented to exchange it for Lord Chamberlain; but that\r\npost the Duke of Bedford insisted upon for Lord Gower.[321] After a\r\nwarm struggle, Lord Gower obtained the Chamberlain’s staff; the Duke\r\nof Rutland remained in his old situation; and the Duke of Marlborough,\r\nthough so very young, was appointed Lord Privy Seal; and his brother,\r\nLord Charles Spencer, was made Comptroller of the Household.\r\n\r\nFox obtained his barony, and retained his place, but not without\r\nexperiencing such a scene of ingratitude as could scarce happen but to\r\na man who had selected his friends more for their utility than their\r\nmerit. In the discussion, and during the defending and proving what\r\nhe had or had not said relative to the cession of the Paymaster’s\r\nplace, Calcraft,[322] his own creature, his cousin, raised from extreme\r\nindigence and obscurity to enormous wealth, to opulence so excessive\r\nthat the vast number of regiments to which he was agent, and the\r\noutrageous plurality of places he held, were universally believed to\r\nbe deposited with him only for Fox’s use,[323] took part with Lord\r\nShelburne, and witnessed to the latter’s tale. Fox ordered Calcraft\r\nto make up his accounts, dismissed him worth near 300,000_l._, and,\r\nthough so rich himself, grew almost justified; and, though so hated,\r\ngrew almost pitied; but this was not all. The man he most loved was\r\nRigby; and though Fox had not crammed him with wealth in the same\r\nlavish guise with which he had enriched Calcraft, he had assisted\r\nin Rigby’s promotions, and wished to push him forwards, and to be\r\nstrictly connected with him in every political walk. In the height\r\nof his quarrel with Shelburne and Calcraft, Fox, walking along St.\r\nJames’s Street, met and stopped Rigby’s chariot, and, leaning on the\r\ndoor of it, began to vent his complaints; when the other, unprovoked\r\nand unconcerned in the dispute, interrupted him with these stunning\r\nsounds, “_You_ tell your story of Shelburne; _he_ has a damned one to\r\ntell of you; I do not trouble myself which is the truth;”--and pushing\r\nhim aside, ordered his coachman to drive away. From that moment Rigby\r\nbecame the enemy of Fox.[324] The necessity of relating this story will\r\nappear hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Hertford was named to succeed the Duke of Bedford at Paris.\r\nFox, in the midst of his quarrels and mortifications, found leisure\r\nto think of his friends, and to think of gratifying his hatred. He\r\nprocured his wife’s brother-in-law, Mr. Bunbury, to be imposed on Lord\r\nHertford as secretary of the embassy; an affront Lord Hertford was\r\nadvised not to digest: but, though he acquiesced in it, he treated\r\nBunbury with such obstinate coldness, that the latter was glad to quit\r\nthe employment. I never knew why Fox was on all occasions the personal\r\nenemy of Lord Hertford and Mr. Conway; neither of them being hostile\r\nto him, and both most inoffensive men. The elder brother was even a\r\ngood courtier, and never in union with Fox’s enemies. Mr. Conway’s\r\ncharacter was indeed a reproach to that of Fox, and antipathy is as\r\noften the cause of enmity as offence is. The decorum and piety of Lord\r\nHertford occasioned men to wonder, when, in the room of Bunbury, he\r\nchose for his secretary the celebrated free-thinker David Hume, totally\r\nunknown to him; but this was the effect of recommendations from other\r\nScots, who had much weight with both Lord and Lady Hertford.[325]\r\n\r\nWhile the arrangement of the new drama was thus settling, there was\r\nan important actor to be made easy; but it was one who, whenever\r\nhe appeared of most consequence, was sure of rendering himself\r\ninsignificant. This was Charles Townshend. After his usual fluctuation,\r\nhe accepted the post of First Lord of the Admiralty, and actually went\r\nto St. James’s to kiss hands for it. Presuming that nothing would or\r\ncould be refused to him, without asking it, without even naming it\r\nto any minister, and as if the seats of his colleagues at that Board\r\nwere in the nomination of the First Commissioner, he carried to court\r\nwith him a Mr. Burrel, one of his followers, intending the latter\r\nshould kiss hands along with himself as another Lord of the Admiralty.\r\nThinking his honour engaged to carry through this absurdity, he would\r\nnot kiss the King’s hand unless Burrel was admitted too. It was flatly\r\nrefused, and Townshend was told that the King had no further occasion\r\nfor his service. Lord Shelburne was immediately named to succeed him at\r\nthe head of the Board of Trade, and Lord Sandwich to fill up the place\r\ndestined to Townshend at the head of the Admiralty.\r\n\r\nThese were all the public promotions calculated to oil the new\r\nsprings of Government. But the Favourite did not close the scene\r\nof his administration without conferring still more solid marks of\r\nhis power and friendship on his family and intimate dependents. The\r\nreversion of Auditor[326] of the Imprest was obtained for his own son\r\nLord Mount-Stewart. My place of Usher of the Exchequer was granted in\r\nreversion to Samuel Martin;[327] and a place[328] in the Custom-house,\r\nheld by my brother, but the far greater share of which had been\r\nbequeathed to me by my father for my brother’s life, was also granted\r\nin reversion to Jenkinson.[329] I was, I confess, much provoked at\r\nthis last grant, and took occasion of fomenting the ill-humour against\r\nthe Favourite, who thus excluded me from the possibility of obtaining\r\nthe continuance of that place to myself in case of my brother’s death;\r\nbut in truth, except in the want of that attention, I had no reason\r\nto complain. I had refused to accept the grant[330] from Fox, and I\r\nhad in terms told Lord Bute that I would accept no favour from him,\r\nthough with great civility, and without acting in any shape as hostile\r\nto him. Thus my resentment kept no deep root: and I can say with the\r\nutmost truth, that as I afterwards, though never connected with him,\r\nwas on many occasions friendly to that great favourite, so no word\r\nin these Memoirs to his prejudice has been dictated by a vindictive\r\nspirit, but the whole narrative is faithfully the representation of\r\nwhat I knew and heard of him. Infinite ill has he occasioned to this\r\ncountry, in which light only it is my intention to pass sentence on his\r\ncharacter. In other respects, the meanness of his abilities and the\r\npoorness of his spirit place him below resentment. His private virtues,\r\nthe long and bitter persecution he has undergone, and many domestic\r\nmisfortunes, would extract every sting which exact or necessary justice\r\ndid not sharpen. The last transaction I am going to mention flowing\r\nnotoriously from his dispensation, was of a nature not to be palliated\r\nor forgotten. To see it in its full force of indignity offered to so\r\nmighty a country, the reader must place himself at the moment when\r\nEngland, triumphant over France and Spain, had annihilated their\r\nnavies, and sat sole arbitress of peace and war, absolutely secure that\r\nEurope combined could not wrench her conquests from her, and sure of\r\nproving her moderation by consenting to peace on almost whatever terms\r\nshe should please to dictate.\r\n\r\nAt that moment did a pusillanimous favourite not only make peace,\r\nrelinquishing the greater and most valuable part of our acquisitions,\r\nbut (what never entered into the imagination of distress and slavery\r\nitself) he purchased that scandalous peace of the envoy of a little\r\nprince, who was not even a party in the war! In short, it now came out,\r\nthat a pension on Ireland of one thousand pounds a year for thirty-one\r\nyears to Count Virri,[331] the Sardinian Minister, through whose hands\r\nthe real negotiation[332] had passed, was the price and tribute of that\r\nshame which Lord Bute, by the treaty of Paris, heaped on Great Britain!\r\n\r\nThe very day on which the Favourite resigned the reins of government\r\ndied the man who, of all England, would perhaps have rejoiced the\r\nmost to behold that event. James Earl Waldegrave was carried off by\r\nthe small-pox, April 8th. With unbounded benevolence, and of the most\r\nflowing courtesy to all men, Lord Waldegrave, whose penetration no\r\nweakness could escape, nor art impose upon, though vice he overlooked,\r\nand only abstained sometimes from connecting with black and bad\r\nmen,--Lord Waldegrave, I say, had been so thoroughly fatigued with\r\nthe insipidity of his pupil the King, and so harassed and unworthily\r\ntreated by the Princess and Lord Bute, that no one of the most\r\ninflammable vengeance, or of the coolest resentment, could harbour\r\nmore bitter hatred and contempt than he did for the King’s mother\r\nand favourite. This aversion carried him to what I scarce believed\r\nmy eyes when he first showed me--severe satires against them. He has\r\nleft behind him, too, some Memoirs[333] of the few years in which he\r\nwas governor to the Prince, that will corroborate many things I have\r\nasserted, and will not tend to make these Anecdotes be reckoned unjust\r\nand unmerciful.\r\n\r\nLord Waldegrave died most unseasonably for his own honour. He stood so\r\nhigh in the esteem of mankind for probity, abilities, and temper, that,\r\nif any man could, he might have accomplished a coalition of parties,\r\nor thrown sense into that party, which, though acting for the cause\r\nof liberty, rather wounded than served it, so ill were they formed\r\nfor counsel or conduct. Had he lived still longer, he must, by the\r\ndeaths of the chiefs, been placed incontestably at the head of that\r\nparty himself. Indeed, but just before his illness, he was much looked\r\nup to by very different sets. Lord Bute himself had thought of him\r\nfor a considerable share on his own retreat; and, but the day before\r\nLord Waldegrave was seized with the small-pox, he had been offered\r\nthe Embassy to France or Lord-Lieutenancy of Ireland, both which he\r\nperemptorily declined. And yet after his death the Court boasted they\r\nhad gained him,--a report much resented, and eagerly contradicted by\r\nhis friend the Duke of Cumberland. But let us now turn to the opening\r\nof the new Administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n  Lord Bute’s pretended abdication of business.--The “Triumvirate”\r\n    (Mr. Grenville, Lord Egremont, and Lord Halifax) who succeeded\r\n    him.--Character of those personages.--Grenville’s ingratitude\r\n    to Lord Bute.--The memorable Forty-fifth Number of the “North\r\n    Briton.”--Wilkes apprehended on a General Warrant.--Committed\r\n    close prisoner to the Tower.--His spirit and wit.--His bad\r\n    character.--He is taken by Habeas Corpus to the Court of Common\r\n    Pleas.--His Speech.--He is discharged from confinement.--Chief\r\n    Justice Pratt.--Triumph of Wilkes.--His endeavour to obtain\r\n    Warrants against the Secretaries of State.--Lord Temple.--\r\n    Discontent in the Cider counties.--Mortifications of the Court.--\r\n    Wilkes challenged by Forbes.--Sudden Death of Lord Egremont.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Parliament had risen on April 19th, everything being then outwardly\r\nsettled. The Favourite, to give some colour to his pretended illness,\r\nand to his still more pretended abdication of business, went to drink\r\nthe waters at Harrowgate; having first protested that he would neither\r\nmeddle, nor offer to intercept or direct the channel of the King’s\r\nfavours. Trusting to this declaration, there started up a triumvirate,\r\nwho not only seemed to be, but who really thought themselves, possessed\r\nof the whole power of government. They seemed, too, to have divided\r\namongst themselves the whole portion of the Favourite’s pride. These\r\nwere Mr. Grenville, his brother-in-law, Lord Egremont, and Lord\r\nHalifax: the two latter, Secretaries of State.\r\n\r\nMr. Grenville[334] had hitherto been known but as a fatiguing orator\r\nand indefatigable drudge, more likely to disgust than to offend.\r\nBeneath this useful unpromising outside lay lurking great abilities:\r\ncourage so confounded with obstinacy that there was no drawing the line\r\nbetwixt them; good intentions to the public, without one great view;\r\nmuch economy for that public, which in truth was the whole amount of\r\nhis good intentions; excessive rapaciousness and parsimony in himself;\r\ninfinite self-conceit, which produced impossibility of instructing,\r\nconvincing, or setting him right; implacability in his temper; and a\r\ntotal want of principles in his political conduct; for, having long\r\nprofessed himself uncommonly bigoted to the doctrines of liberty, he\r\nbecame the staunchest champion of unwarrantable power. As all his\r\npassions were expressed by one livid smile, he never blushed at the\r\nvariations in his behaviour. His ingratitude to his benefactor, Lord\r\nBute, and his reproaching Mr. Pitt with the profusion of a war which\r\nhe had sometimes actively supported, and always tacitly approved,\r\nwhile holding a beneficial place,[335] were but too often paralleled\r\nby the crimes of other men; but scarce any man ever wore in his face\r\nsuch outward and visible marks of the hollow, cruel, and rotten heart\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nLord Egremont[336] was a composition of pride, ill-nature, avarice, and\r\nstrict good-breeding; with such infirmity in his frame, that he could\r\nnot speak truth on the most trivial occasion. He had humour, and did\r\nnot want sense; but had neither knowledge of business, nor the smallest\r\nshare of parliamentary abilities.[337]\r\n\r\nOf the three, Lord Halifax[338] was by far the weakest, and at the\r\nsame time the most amiable man. His pride, like Lord Egremont’s, taught\r\nhim much civility. He spoke readily and agreeably, and only wanted\r\nmatter and argument. His profusion in building, planting, and on a\r\nfavourite mistress, had brought him into great straits, from which he\r\nsought to extricate himself by discreditable means. He aimed at virtues\r\nhe could not support, and was rather carried away by his vices than\r\nsensible of them.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned Mr. Grenville’s ingratitude to Lord Bute, which\r\nimplies preceding obligation. He had owed solely and entirely to Lord\r\nBute the rich reversion of a Tellership of the Exchequer for his son.\r\nLord Bute perhaps thought it was no light additional favour to have\r\nmade over his power into Mr. Grenville’s hands. But the latter had\r\nnot forgotten how contemptuously he had been set aside the last year;\r\nand, as Lord Bute by no means observed his promise of abstaining from\r\nexerting his influence at Court, it is but candid to allow that Lord\r\nBute diminished the favour by not adhering to the terms on which he\r\nbestowed it. Be that how it would, Grenville had not sat a month at the\r\nTreasury, before, remembering the affront and forgetting the reversion,\r\nhe set himself by all manner of means to lessen the profits of the\r\nother reversion which Lord Bute had procured for his own son. Thus\r\nauspiciously commenced the new administration!\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was known that Lord Bute intended to quit, Wilkes had\r\nforborne to publish his North Britons; waiting to see the consequences\r\nof the change. The tone he had given did not, however, stop. In\r\nthe City they toasted to Wit, Beauty, Virtue, and Honour, ironic\r\ndesignations of the King, Queen, Princess Dowager, and Lord Bute.\r\nThe North Briton too was soon resumed, and on the 23rd of April was\r\npublished the memorable _forty-fifth_ number, which occasioned so much\r\ntrouble to the author, procured so essential a correction of loose\r\nand till then undefined power, and produced so many silly conundrums\r\nand wretched witticisms on the number itself.[339] This famous paper\r\ngave a flat lie to the King himself, for having, by the Favourite’s\r\nsuggestion, assumed the honour of obtaining peace for the King of\r\nPrussia.[340]\r\n\r\nNothing could be more just than the satire, nothing more bold than\r\nthe unmeasured liberty with which it was uttered.[341] The Prussian\r\nmonarch must have read with scorn, and Europe with laughter, so absurd\r\na boast as our vaunting to have saved an ally whom we had betrayed and\r\nabandoned. Ridicule might have handled this vain-glorious falsehood\r\nwith full severity and full security, without passing the bounds which\r\nlaw allows. But when Parliament had connived at the treachery, could\r\nit be supposed that it would suffer a private hand to wield the bolt\r\nwhich had slept in the custody of so many corrupt representatives? The\r\nlie given in print to the Crown, by an obscure man, was an unparalleled\r\nlicense. If the King had a particle of power left, or his servants,\r\nor his magistrates, of spirit, such an insult could not be passed\r\nover. The rashness of his servants contrived to involve the Crown and\r\nthemselves in inextricable difficulties, and to make the unwarrantable\r\nbehaviour of Wilkes appear innocent, when compared with the excesses\r\nthey committed themselves.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to lead the reader through the maze of vague and\r\nbarbarous law-proceedings, which sprang out of this transaction. It\r\ndid but lay open the undefined or unmeaning magazine of terms which\r\nthe chicanery or contradictions of ages had heaped together, and it\r\nproved that the Crown and the subject might be justified in almost\r\nany excesses. The right hand of Nonsense armed the King, and her left\r\ndefended the subject. The lawyers on either side were employed in\r\ndiscovering springes or loop-holes.\r\n\r\nAfter a week’s deliberation Wilkes was seized, April 30th, by three\r\nmessengers, on a _general warrant_, signed by Lord Halifax. They had\r\nbeen ordered to apprehend him at midnight, but abstained till noon of\r\nthe 30th. Churchill, his friend, then with him, slipped out of the\r\nhouse, either to secure himself or to give the alarm. Mr. Wood,[342]\r\nthe Under-Secretary, and Philip Carteret Webbe,[343] a most villanous\r\ntool and agent in any iniquity, seized his papers, though he had\r\nreceived intimation time enough to convey away the most material. He\r\nwas conducted to Lord Halifax’s, where he behaved with much firmness\r\nand confidence, and grievously wounded the haughty dignity attempted to\r\nbe assumed by Lord Egremont. They committed him close prisoner to the\r\nTower; a severity rarely, and never fit to be practised but in cases of\r\nmost dangerous treason. This treatment served but to increase Wilkes’s\r\nspirit and wit. He desired to be confined in the same room where Sir\r\nWilliam Windham, Lord Egremont’s father, had been kept on a charge of\r\nJacobitism; and said he hoped, if there could be found such a chamber\r\nin the Tower, that he might not be lodged where any Scotchman had been\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, being told of the reasons alleged by the King\r\nof Spain[344] for setting aside his eldest son, two of which were,\r\nthat the Prince squinted, and did not believe the mysteries of our\r\nholy religion; then said Wilkes, “I can never be King of Spain, for I\r\nsquint, and believe none of those mysteries.”\r\n\r\nThe rigour of the commitment gave serious alarm; but, the very day on\r\nwhich it happened, Wilkes’s friends applied to the Court of Common\r\nPleas for his habeas corpus, expecting it from Lord Chief Justice\r\nPratt, and scorning or despairing of it from Lord Mansfield.\r\n\r\nLord Temple instantly resorted to the Tower, but was denied admittance\r\nto the prisoner; a restraint the ministers found the very next day\r\nthey must take off. Lord Temple then returned to visit Wilkes, as did\r\nthe Duke of Grafton and some few others of rank; but, in general, the\r\nprisoner’s character was so bad, and his conduct so rash and unguarded,\r\nthat few who were either decent or cautious cared to be concerned with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe habeas corpus being granted, Wilkes was carried to the Court of\r\nCommon Pleas, May 3rd. He spoke for an hour, said “attempts had been\r\nmade to corrupt him, now to persecute him; he had been worse treated\r\nthan any rebel Scot.” The crowd in Westminster-hall gave a great shout;\r\nthe Chief Justice, with great dignity, reproved them. The judges took\r\ntime to deliberate. The people were profuse of their acclamations to\r\nthe sufferer.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th, he wrote a letter to his daughter (a child whom he had\r\nplaced in a convent in France for her education), and sent it open to\r\nLord Halifax; it congratulated her on living in a _free_ country. He\r\nwas the same day turned out of his commission in the militia.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th, being again conveyed from the Tower to Westminster-hall,\r\nPratt and the other judges of the Common Pleas unanimously discharged\r\nhim from his confinement; the Chief Justice delivering their opinions,\r\nand dismissing him on his parliamentary privilege, “_because_, though\r\nprivilege of Parliament does not hold against a breach of the peace, it\r\ndoes against what only _tends_ to a breach of the peace. The case of\r\nthe seven bishops was quoted; the judges Wright, Holloway, and Allibone\r\nhad been against them. Allibone, said Pratt, was a Papist; Wright and\r\nHolloway had been appointed for the occasion; but Powel, an honest man,\r\nhad declared for the bishops. On the other hand, he quoted a recent\r\ncase of Lord Tankerville, who having been arrested on a prosecution for\r\nbribery in the election for Windsor, the Lords had declared it a breach\r\nof privilege”--we shall find how much less tender the Commons were of\r\n_their_ privileges.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice had no sooner granted the enlargement of Wilkes,\r\nthan two of the King’s serjeants presented letters to the Court, from\r\nthe Attorney and Solicitor Generals, demanding to be admitted into\r\nthe Court, as the case concerned the King’s interest. The Attorney,\r\nit is said, has a right of interfering in any Court where the King’s\r\ninterest is agitated; it is doubted whether the Solicitor has the same\r\nprerogative. To both Pratt answered, that they had applied too late.\r\nNow did the Court feel the consequence of having forced Pratt to be\r\nChief Justice against his will.\r\n\r\nThis triumph quite overset the little discretion of which Wilkes had\r\nbeen master. He seemed to put himself into the situation of a King,\r\nwho, not content with the outworks with which the law has surrounded\r\nhis person, attempts to employ the law as offensive artillery.\r\nAffecting to have been robbed of moveables when his papers were seized,\r\nWilkes entered into a virulent controversy, by letter, with the\r\nSecretaries of State; and even endeavoured, though in vain, to obtain\r\nwarrants for searching their houses. This wild conduct did not help his\r\ncause. His next step fell more perniciously on his own head. He erected\r\na printing-press in his own house; and, against the remonstrances\r\nof Lord Temple, who never wanted fear where there was room for it,\r\nand who had no taste for anything that did not lead directly home to\r\nfaction, indulged himself in realizing those sallies of his humour and\r\nintemperance, which are scarcely excusable when transient and confined\r\nto the jollity of intoxicated moments at table. The Court regarding\r\nLord Temple as the instigator, not as the Socrates, of this Alcibiades,\r\nremoved him from the lord-lieutenancy of the county of Buckingham.\r\nThe printers, who had been vexed in their business by the orders of\r\nthe Secretaries of State, and encouraged by the victory of Wilkes,\r\nprosecuted the messengers, and obtained damages to the value of 300_l._\r\n\r\nThe same spirit spread into the west. In the cider counties they\r\ndressed up a figure in Scotch plaid, with a blue riband, to represent\r\nthe Favourite, and this figure seemed to lead by the nose an ass\r\nroyally crowned. At the same time they voted instructions to their\r\nmembers to try to obtain a repeal of the act. The circumstance of\r\nthe act being passed under so unpopular an administration was most\r\nunfortunate. It had taken thirty years to open the eyes of mankind\r\nto the benefits of excise: the only, at least the best, method of\r\nimproving the revenue without imposing new burthens. Being started at\r\nso ungracious a moment, the old prejudices were industriously revived.\r\n\r\nThe Court at the same time met with some mortifications in their\r\npursuit of congratulatory addresses on the peace, which they sedulously\r\npromoted. One Judge Perrot[345] was so servile as to recommend it from\r\nthe bench on the circuit. The Duke of Newcastle and Lord Hardwicke, the\r\none Chancellor, the other High Steward of the University of Cambridge,\r\nrefused to go to St. James’s with the address of that body. Allen,[346]\r\nthe ostentatious patron of Pope and Warburton, the latter of whom had\r\nmarried his natural daughter, prevailed on the city of Bath to thank\r\nthe King for the _adequate_[347] peace, and had himself the insolence\r\nor folly to send that address, so profligately worded, to Mr. Pitt,\r\nwith whom he had maintained a mutual intercourse of flattery. Mr. Pitt\r\ndisdained to present their compliment to the King, and even declared he\r\nwould represent their city no more.\r\n\r\nWilkes, in the meantime, had gone to France to visit his daughter.\r\nThere he received a challenge from one Forbes[348] an outlawed Scot in\r\nthe French service, who could not digest the torrents of abuse which\r\nWilkes had poured forth on his country. Alexander Murray, brother\r\nof Lord Elibank, and an outlaw too since the Westminster Election\r\nin 1751,[349] was the go-between in this quarrel, not without being\r\nsuspected of inflaming it. Wilkes accepted the defiance for the next\r\nmorning, but, when Forbes called on him, affected to laugh it off,\r\nsaying, he was bound to fight Lord Egremont by preference before any\r\nother man. When that excuse availed not, he asked Forbes if he had\r\nprovided a second; to which the other replied, such preparation was\r\ntoo dangerous in France. Altercations thickened, till at last the\r\nlieutenant de police was sent for, who obliged Forbes to promise not to\r\nproceed any farther.\r\n\r\nHad the duel with Lord Egremont been seriously intended, from that too\r\nwould Wilkes have been delivered; for the earl, who was of a sanguine\r\nand apoplectic complexion, of which he had felt attacks, and though\r\nwarned in vain to moderate the indulgence of his palate, to which he\r\nwas ungovernably prone, died suddenly on the 21st of August, and put an\r\nend to a triumvirate which had involved their master and themselves in\r\nsuch a labyrinth of knotty and undecided questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n  Perplexity of the “Triumvirate.”--Lord Bute’s unsuccessful\r\n    Manœuvres.--Lord Halifax and Mr. Grenville remonstrate with the\r\n    King.--The Duchess of Bedford’s animosity to Lord Bute and the\r\n    Princess of Wales.--Schemes of the Bedford Faction.--Mr. Pitt\r\n    sent for by the King.--Negotiation with the former.--The Treaty\r\n    broken off.--Causes of the Rupture.--The King’s Account of his\r\n    Interviews with Pitt.--Pitt’s Proposals.--Proscriptions.--\r\n    Machinations of Lord Sandwich.--Ministerial Arrangements.--\r\n    Grenville’s Power.--Lord Temple’s Conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it was not the affair of Wilkes which had alone perplexed the\r\nTriumvirate. They found they were by no means in the confidence of the\r\nKing. He was continually suggesting new measures to them, which plainly\r\ncame from a hidden quarter. A fortnight before the death of Lord\r\nEgremont, his Majesty had hinted to Grenville that he wished to prevail\r\non Lord Hardwicke to return, if not to his service, at least to his\r\ncouncils. Whether the blow received from the Common Pleas had alarmed\r\nthe Favourite (who had made but a very short stay at Harrowgate), and\r\nhad warned him to look out for more support; or whether he thought\r\nthe three ministers insufficient; or whether, which is most likely,\r\nhe wished already to get rid of them, especially having detected the\r\nunderhand practices of Grenville against his son’s patent;--in short,\r\nwhatever was the motive, Grenville could not be ignorant who was\r\nauthor of the advice, and only replied, _it would not do_. The King\r\ninsisted, and the overture was made; Hardwicke rejected it, and said he\r\nwould not abandon Newcastle. The King then commanded the same trial to\r\nbe made on Newcastle, but with exclusion of Mr. Pitt; an early proof\r\nof those crooked councils of division with which the Favourite was\r\nafterwards so often charged, and which were so agreeable to the King’s\r\nnatural insincerity. Newcastle haughtily refused the offers made to\r\nhim. Still were the King’s discourses dark and ambiguous; and, though\r\naffecting to call out for new strength by extending preferments, he had\r\nrefused, at Grenville’s recommendation, to make the Duke of Leeds[350]\r\nPresident of the Council, and Lord Hyde[351] Chief Justice in Eyre.\r\n\r\nOn this behaviour the three ministers had determined to bring his\r\nMajesty to an explanation. Lord Halifax broke the ice; complained\r\nof their not having his countenance, and concluded with telling him\r\nthat he had but three options: to support them; to try a coalition of\r\nparties, which was impracticable; or to surrender himself, bound hand\r\nand foot, to Mr. Pitt. Mr. Grenville went much farther; reproached\r\nhim with violating the assurances he had given them that Lord Bute\r\nshould meddle no more, and with abandoning the ministers he had himself\r\nchosen. The King renewed his professions, and promised to be firm to\r\nthem. Grenville said he should go into the country for a fortnight,\r\nand begged the King to take his final resolution against that time. At\r\nGrenville’s return the King had renewed his protestations, and, the\r\nvery day before Lord Egremont died, Grenville had been to assure him\r\nof the King’s promise to be true to them; but, on the 25th, Grenville,\r\nthrough great professions to him, perceived that his Majesty was not\r\nwithout a disposition of recalling Pitt, against which Grenville made a\r\nwarm, not to say indecent, remonstrance and protest.\r\n\r\nThe Bedfords in the interim had totally renounced Bute. The Duchess had\r\ncarried her animosity still higher, and would not, on her return from\r\nthe French embassy, be prevailed on to pay her duty to the Princess of\r\nWales. Casting about for allies (for Grenville and Lord Halifax they\r\ndespised), the Bedford faction had not been without views of connecting\r\nwith the Duke of Cumberland and Newcastle; and his Royal Highness\r\nhad at this very juncture been invited to Woburn. The death of Lord\r\nEgremont seeming to dissolve that ministry, a bolder stroke was struck;\r\nand the Bedfords, hoping under him to get possession of the government,\r\ndetermined to attempt making Mr. Pitt minister. With this view Rigby,\r\nin the most private and mysterious manner, went down to Woodstock, and\r\nsent for the Duke of Bedford, who was then at Blenheim, and persuaded\r\nhim to go directly to town to the King, and advise him to send for Mr.\r\nPitt.[352] Lord Shelburne, who in his separate department had affected\r\nto act minister too, had assured them that this would not be opposed by\r\nLord Bute; but had not trusted them, or was not trusted himself, with\r\nLord Bute’s real disposition that way. Rigby had no sooner lighted the\r\nmatch than he left the mine to take fire, and retired to his own house\r\nin the country; while the Duke of Bedford posted to the King, and told\r\nhim, that, as he had made peace abroad, he must now make it at home,\r\nand that could only be effected by sending for Mr. Pitt.\r\n\r\nLord Bute, hearing this measure had been prescribed by the Duke of\r\nBedford, thought it wiser to have the merit of it himself. Mr. Pitt,\r\nthough trusting to the clamour of party for support, had seldom openly\r\ncourted it; and, since he had had such eminent services to boast, had\r\naffected to despise it. He had kept clear of all transactions with\r\nWilkes, and had condemned Lord Temple’s connection with him, and, yet\r\nmore, his visits to that incendiary in the Tower. Mr. Pitt’s amity\r\nmight reconcile the people, and no man was so accommodating a partner\r\nin power; Pitt having few or no dependents, and scorning to meddle in\r\nthe distribution of common places and preferments. On these grounds\r\nthe Favourite, through the intervention of Alderman Beckford, entered\r\ninto a negotiation with Mr. Pitt, and, finding facilities there beyond\r\nhis most sanguine hopes, induced the King to send for that formidable\r\ndictator.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 28th of August that Mr. Grenville, arriving at Buckingham\r\nHouse, was struck with the apparition of Mr. Pitt’s chair and servants\r\nin the Court. This was the first notice he or the public received of a\r\nphenomenon so little expected, at least by the latter.\r\n\r\nLet it be remarked here, that I do not pretend to give a perfect and\r\nentire account of the following negotiation. No transaction was ever\r\ninvolved in more contradictions and mystery; for, though the retainers\r\nof both sides spoke out, and amply, their narratives disagreed\r\nmaterially, and the exact truth was never fully known. From all I could\r\ncollect then or since, and from explanations which I have gathered by\r\ncommenting on the subsequent behaviour of the actors, I believe the\r\nensuing relation is pretty near the truth.\r\n\r\nThe Bedfords had sent Calcraft to Hayes[353] to sound how Mr. Pitt\r\nstood affected to them, and Calcraft returned with a most favourable\r\naccount. On this assurance had the Duke of Bedford been pushed on the\r\nmeasure of advising the recall of Mr. Pitt. Lord Bute had not been\r\nless encouraged by the report of Alderman Beckford, for Mr. Pitt had\r\ndetermined, if ever he should return to Court, not to make himself\r\nunwelcome there. The Favourite, therefore, saw him privately at his\r\nhouse in Jermyn-street before he saw the King, and advised him not\r\nto propose Lord Temple for the Treasury, which would break off the\r\nnegotiation. Pitt thanked him, but did not take his advice,--and on\r\nthis rock undoubtedly did the treaty split; for all the variations I\r\nhave hinted at, were but circumstances artfully seized or feigned to\r\ncolour the rupture, or misrepresent it.\r\n\r\nThe Favourite deceived, or deceiving himself, brought about the\r\ninterview, as I have said, between the King and Mr. Pitt. It lasted\r\nthree hours, and the bargain was universally thought concluded. But the\r\nKing had not only been revolted at Mr. Pitt’s terms, though without\r\nowning it, but Mr. Pitt had had the sagacity to discover his Majesty’s\r\nrepugnance; and therefore not only carried on the farce of returning\r\nto Court the next day, but was so dexterous as to see the Duke of\r\nNewcastle, with whose interests he had by no means clogged his first\r\ndemands; and assuring his Grace of his zeal for his service, went\r\nback to the King with a schedule of terms extremely enlarged. These\r\nwere peremptorily rejected, and the treaty broke off, on pretences\r\nwhich the one had not meaned to ask, nor the other cared whether he\r\ngranted or refused. The Treasury for Lord Temple was the real stone of\r\noffence.[354]\r\n\r\nBut no sooner was the rupture known, than all tongues were let loose\r\nto inquire, guess, invent, or assign causes. The King detailed his\r\nconversation with Mr. Pitt to all that came about him--and almost all\r\nadded to it, as their interest or malice suggested. Mr. Pitt saw very\r\nfew, and to fewer would disclose any circumstances. He soon found that\r\nhe could not speak without flatly contradicting what his Majesty had\r\nsaid, or was reported to have said. No wonder the transaction came\r\nforth loaded with uncertainties and inconsistence!\r\n\r\nThe substance reported was, that Mr. Pitt had proscribed almost all the\r\nministry then existing, and yet had been very cool in recommendations\r\nof the Opposition. The first part was not very credible, for though\r\nhis haughtiness rendered him indifferent to those who affected to\r\ncall themselves his party, his nature, on the other hand, was not\r\nvindictive: and it was true, that he had not been worse treated by\r\nthe one set than by the other. On his second audience, I believe it\r\nmight be true to a good degree that he had been dictatorial; but at\r\nfirst he had been far more moderate. However, it was given out that he\r\nproscribed all who had made, or had voted for the peace: whereas he had\r\nspoken tenderly of some of the negotiators; and had said of the treaty\r\nitself, that he would take it, and make the best he could of it.\r\n\r\nThe King himself relating the two conversations, took care to dwell\r\non any circumstances that would most affect the persons to whom he\r\nmade the confidence. Thus, to Lord Hertford, at that time Lord of the\r\nBedchamber in waiting, the King said, “Mr. Pitt proscribed several,\r\nparticularly your friend Lord Powis:[355] I told him, continued his\r\nMajesty, that he might restore Lord George Cavendish;[356] but Lord\r\nPowis had stuck by me, and I never would abandon him.[357] I will\r\nstand by those who have stood by me. He said little,” continued the\r\nKing, “of Legge (another of Lord Hertford’s friends, consequently the\r\nKing intended Legge should be informed), only, having recommended Lord\r\nTemple for the Treasury, Mr. Pitt said, Mr. Legge may be his Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer, if he pleases--if not, _Lord Temple will name\r\nanother_. He surprised me,” pursued the King to Lord Hertford, “with\r\nsaying still less of your relation the Duke of Grafton; and more, with\r\ncrying up to me for one of the first men of business in the kingdom,\r\nLord Rockingham,[358] whom he intended for First Lord of the Admiralty.\r\nI thought,” said his Majesty, “I had not two men in my bedchamber of\r\nless parts than Lord Rockingham.” The King spoke handsomely of both\r\nthe Dukes of Grafton and Devonshire, and laid his treatment of the\r\nlatter on passion, that Duke not having made the least excuse for not\r\ncoming to council when he had been summoned. Knowing that Lord Hertford\r\nwas not well with Fox, the King affirmed that he had taken the latter\r\nlast winter against his inclination; and he told Lord Hertford that\r\nthe Duke of Newcastle had urged the Duke of Bedford to make a worse\r\npeace than Mr. Pitt had projected, and had promised to defend it: and\r\nthat the Duke of Devonshire had recommended to the Duke of Bedford to\r\nmake _any_ peace; and then, fearing to be reproached with that advice,\r\nalways avoided conversation with that Duke. “When he took leave of me,”\r\nadded the King, “Mr. Pitt said to me, Sir, the House of Commons will\r\nnot force me upon your Majesty, and I will never come into your service\r\nagainst your consent.” “You see,” said Lord Hertford, when he repeated\r\nthis conversation to me, “that if they did not shut the King up, he\r\nwould talk enough to any body!”--but if they sometimes debarred him\r\nfrom talking, he was now instructed to talk--and every grain he sowed\r\nbrought forth an hundred-fold.\r\n\r\nI must observe that his Majesty had told Lady Holland, in the\r\ndrawing-room, that he should never forget Mr. Fox’s undertaking the\r\nHouse of Commons and the Peace in the last winter. It is certain that\r\nin this interview with Mr. Pitt, the King _proposed_ to take the\r\nPaymaster’s place from Fox, and bestow it on George Grenville.\r\n\r\nOf the persons really proscribed, the chief was Lord Mansfield. “He\r\nis a Jacobite,” said Pitt, “and means sir, to ruin your family.” He\r\nrecommended Pratt for a peerage, and in future for the Chancellor’s\r\nSeals; would have saved the Duke of Marlborough, as a young man\r\nmisled; Elliot, for having tried to preserve union between him and\r\nLord Bute; and of Lord Halifax he had said, “that he was a pretty\r\nman, and, as in bad circumstances, might be Groom of the Stole or\r\nPaymaster.” “The Duke of Newcastle,” he said, “would take any place\r\nnot of business.” Charles Townshend he proposed for Secretary of State\r\nwith himself. The Secretary at War should not be of consequence, as it\r\nwas now under Ellis,[359] that clerk of Fox the Paymaster, but should\r\ndepend on him whom his Majesty should think proper to command his army.\r\n“Then,” said the King, “we shall agree in Lord Granby;” “or,” said\r\nPitt, “in Lord Albemarle.”[360] This was the sole approach he seemed to\r\nmake towards the Duke of Cumberland; but never would his Majesty have\r\ntrusted his army with a creature of his uncle.\r\n\r\nOf Lord Gower Pitt spoke not favourably, having probably discovered\r\nthat it was the way to make his court to the Favourite, who, having\r\nperceived that that Lord aimed at being a favourite himself, had taken\r\ncare to alienate the King’s mind from him. Rigby was not excepted for\r\nmercy,[361] and Lord Sandwich much less. Of the Duke of Bedford Mr.\r\nPitt spoke properly, as of a man well-intentioned, but shamefully\r\nmisguided, and who might hereafter, if in proper hands, be useful to\r\nGovernment. But nothing harsh did Pitt utter against the peace: he\r\nwould try to _meliorate_ it. Should a national spirit of inquiry arise,\r\nhe would not resist it. He had held the same language formerly on the\r\nloss of Minorca: they were specious words then and now, but with no\r\nsanguinary intentions.\r\n\r\nWhen Calcraft was reproached by the Bedford faction with having\r\ndeceived them on Pitt’s disposition towards them, he could not evade\r\nthe charge. A breach ensued, and he remained attached to Mr. Pitt.\r\n\r\nSandwich, finding himself proscribed by Pitt, made advantage of the\r\nmoment, and exerting all his invention and industry, of which no\r\nman possessed a larger receipt, he set himself to persuade men of\r\nall denominations that they had been marked in black letters in the\r\ndictator’s catalogue of pains and penalties. He even drew every man’s\r\ncharacter to himself, and selecting their faults or deficiencies,\r\nascribed to Mr. Pitt both the recapitulation and imaginary sentence\r\nthat followed it. Grenville and Lord Halifax caught the righteous\r\nflame, and diffused it: Grenville even assembling the Commissioners of\r\nthe several boards, and assuring them, one and all, that they had been\r\ncondemned by Mr. Pitt to be cashiered. To Woburn, where the Duke of\r\nBedford was at this anxious moment detained by his royal visitor, the\r\nDuke of Cumberland, Lord Sandwich wrote inflammatory letters, telling\r\nBedford that he was proscribed, and his peace to be attacked. The warm\r\nlittle Duke caught fire; but Rigby, to whom Sandwich had made the same\r\nreport, doubted, and came to town, where he was either duped into, or\r\npersuaded to join in the imposition.\r\n\r\nGrenville was pressed by the King to remain minister, and did not\r\nwant to be pressed. The Duke of Bedford, in the hot fit of zeal and\r\nresentment, accepted the post of President; and Shelburne, who had\r\nshuffled round the compass with so ill success, and lost the favour of\r\nLord Bute, choosing now to adhere to Pitt, and resigning the seals,\r\nthey were bestowed on the only man who could replace, or excel him,\r\nLord Sandwich. It was fortunate for Grenville and union, that the\r\nfaction did not wish to place the Duke of Bedford at the head of the\r\nTreasury,--but they could not trust his warmth and absurdities. In\r\nIreland he had disgusted everybody, and had gone so far as to tell the\r\nIrish themselves that theirs was no Parliament. The Court had wished\r\nto have Charles Townshend Secretary of State with Lord Halifax; but he\r\ntoo, for that time, stuck to Mr. Pitt, and refused.\r\n\r\nThus, from a strange concurrence of jarring causes, there sprung up out\r\nof great weakness a strong and cemented ministry, who all acquiesced in\r\nthe predominant power of Grenville. The Favourite hated, had tried to\r\nshake him off, and he knew it. How much must his brother Temple have\r\nbeen detested at Court, when, under all these humiliating aspects, it\r\nwas thought preferable to retain Grenville!\r\n\r\nIn truth, nothing could be more offensive than Lord Temple’s conduct,\r\nwhether considered in a public or private light. Opposition to his\r\nfactious views seemed to let him loose from all ties, all restraint\r\nof principles. Of the truth of this assertion he, at the time I am\r\ndescribing, gave a convincing proof. His brother George was at that\r\nmoment the object of his jealousy and resentment. He had, however, been\r\nprevailed upon by his family, or rather by considerations of family,\r\nto suffer Mr. Grenville to be rechosen for Buckingham; but on this\r\nsole condition, that Mr. Grenville should give up a paper formerly\r\nreceived from him. When Dr. Lyttelton, Bishop of Carlisle,[362] who had\r\nnegotiated this treaty, gave him the paper, he said, after reading it,\r\n“It is true, I am bound in honour and by promise to make a firm entail\r\nof my estate,--I will; but it shall be on my brother James.”[363] The\r\ncase was this: it had been discovered during the life of their uncle,\r\nthe late Lord Cobham, that he had made a flaw in the settlement of\r\nhis estate. A meeting of his nephews was held in the presence of his\r\nsister,[364] and their mother, the late Lady Temple. She said, “My son\r\nRichard is ill with my brother; if we tell my brother of this flaw, he\r\nmay make a new settlement, and give his fortune from my eldest son.”\r\nGeorge Grenville consented to keep the secret, provided his brother\r\ngave him the most solemn promise in writing to resettle the estate\r\nwhen he should come to it. Insensible to such a tie, and filled with\r\nrancour, he had the mortification of seeing that very brother preserved\r\nin power merely to his exclusion.\r\n\r\nOther persons preferred on the new settlement were Lord Egmont to the\r\nhead of the Admiralty, and Lord Hyde to be joint-Postmaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n  Secret power of Lord Bute.--His rupture with Pitt.--The late\r\n    Prince of Wales’s character of Bute.--Extraordinary Anecdote.--\r\n    Mr. Legge’s imprudent Manœuvre.--Unanimous attempt to destroy\r\n    Wilkes.--Governor Johnstone.--General Wall.--The Comte de\r\n    Guerchy.--His character.--Madame de Guerchy.--The Duke de\r\n    Nivernois, and the Chevalier d’Eon.--Death of Augustus the\r\n    Third, of Saxony.--The Pope invites the Duke of York to Rome.--\r\n    Humiliation of the helpless Line of Stuart.--Charles Yorke resigns\r\n    the Attorney-Generalship.--Trimming conduct of the Yorke Family.--\r\n    Unfavourable Commencement of the new Lord-Lieutenant’s power in\r\n    Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nStill did the same grievance remain, the favour and secret power of\r\nLord Bute. Grenville and Lord Halifax insisted that he should go\r\nabroad; and it was said to be promised. At least his refusal, or\r\nbreach of promise, was made the pretence for depriving him of the\r\ncustody of the King’s Privy-purse, an office he yet retained. The\r\nnomination of a successor showed how little the ministers had gained,\r\nand how vainly they endeavoured to destroy his credit, the Purse\r\nbeing immediately given to Sir William Breton, who was Groom of the\r\nBedchamber to the King, as he had been to the King’s father, and who\r\nwas a most devoted tool of the Princess and her favourite. A stronger\r\nproof of the latter’s confidence in his own power was given by himself.\r\nGeorge Grenville having written a very voluminous letter to Sir John\r\nPhillips, giving an account of the negotiation with Mr. Pitt and its\r\nmiscarriage, of which letter the King had seen and approved every\r\nparagraph, Sir John wrote a warm expostulation to Lord Bute (who he did\r\nnot know had been concerned in that treaty), blaming the timidity of\r\nsending for Mr. Pitt. Lord Bute returned a haughty answer, in which he\r\nsaid, _whatever the ministers might think, they should find he himself\r\nwas minister still_. A memorable sentence, confirmed by facts, and of\r\nwhich the contrary assertion was vainly attempted afterwards to be\r\nimposed upon the world.\r\n\r\nThe mysteries of this man’s conduct, and the reserve and eccentric\r\nstarts of Mr. Pitt, have made any lights valuable that can be thrown\r\non this part of our history. Mr. Pitt’s was the character suited to\r\nsupport and colour over the pusillanimity of the Favourite, but his\r\njealousy and their mutual pride threw them at a distance. The affair of\r\nLord George Sackville, who was attached to Lord Bute, and proscribed by\r\nPitt in compliment to Prince Ferdinand, had given the finishing stroke\r\nto their rupture; hastened too, by that very attachment of Mr. Pitt\r\nto the foreign house of Brunswick. Nor, with all the disposition of\r\nPitt to forgive the Favourite’s offences, could they meet again, while\r\nLord Temple hung upon his brother-in-law, and was the _sine quâ non_\r\nof Mr. Pitt’s return to Court. On every occasion of moment appeared\r\nthe justness of the character drawn of Lord Bute by the late Prince of\r\nWales, who did not want parts, nor ill-nature to sharpen those parts,\r\nnor insolence to utter what either of them dictated. Growing tired of\r\nLord Bute a little before his death, he said to him, “Bute, you would\r\nmake an excellent ambassador in some proud little Court where there is\r\nnothing to do.” It had been happy for England, and for Lord Bute too,\r\nif the Prince could have made that destination of him--I mean, without\r\nliving to execute it himself.\r\n\r\nI shall relate another very extraordinary anecdote, which will not be\r\nmentioned improperly in this place, though I do not know the precise\r\ntime in which it happened. The Princess Dowager dreamed that she was\r\nin the palace of Saxe Gotha: the window was open, and the moon, level\r\nto it, shook with a tremulous motion before her eyes, to her great\r\ndisquiet. She bade Lord Bute try to fix it. Extending his arms to stop\r\nits motion, it burst in his hand into ten thousand fiery splinters; on\r\nwhich, turning to the Princess, he said reproachfully, “See, Madam, to\r\nwhat you have brought me!” This dream was the Princess so weak as to\r\nrepeat the next morning to some of her women; one of whom, I guess the\r\nwife of Velters Cornwall, told it to Lady Suffolk,[365] who trusted it\r\nto me. She did not name her authority, but said she heard it from one\r\nof the Princess’s bedchamber; and Mrs. Cornwall I know was the one with\r\nwhom Lady Suffolk was the most connected. I repeat this vision, not as\r\nprophetic or divine, but as a strong picture of what passed in the mind\r\non which it painted itself.\r\n\r\nBefore I close this account of the negotiation, I ought to assign\r\nthe reason why Mr. Pitt had so slightingly or offensively mentioned\r\nMr. Legge, the second in Opposition, and long the second to Mr. Pitt\r\nhimself. With all his abilities, Legge was of a creeping underhand\r\nnature, and aspired to the lion’s place by the manœuvre of the mole.\r\nWhile yet connected with Mr. Pitt, and before he had lost favour\r\nat Leicester House,[366] he had, before the late King’s death,\r\nbrought about a secret interview with Newcastle; but with so much\r\ncircumspection, that meeting him at Lord Duplin’s, Legge had insisted\r\nthe conversation should pass without candles and in the dark. The Duke\r\nwas charmed with the mystery, and with the pleasure of betraying it to\r\nMr. Pitt. Mr. Elliot, as he told me himself, discovered it too, and\r\nacquainted Lord Bute--and thus with both was Legge ruined. I now return\r\nto the common occurrences of the year.\r\n\r\nIn one point the Favourite and his rivals agreed; that is, in the\r\ndestruction of Wilkes. The rashness and despotic conduct of the\r\ntriumvirate had made them parties in the same cause; they pursuing him\r\nwith what they called Law, and the Scotch without attention to any\r\nlaw. Johnstone, one of Lord Bute’s American governors,[367] had the\r\nsame view with Forbes, but took a looser plan. Having been reflected\r\non in a North Briton, I think then no longer written by Wilkes, he\r\nchallenged the author, whoever it was; and, to be sure of provoking at\r\nleast one person, threw out in his challenge printed in the newspapers,\r\nsevere sarcasms on Lord Temple’s want of spirit.\r\n\r\nAbout this time General Wall,[368] a true friend to the union of\r\nEngland and Spain, finding the French interest daily making greater\r\nprogress at Madrid, desired leave to resign on pretence of failure of\r\nhis eyesight. Grimaldi[369] was immediately ordered home from Paris\r\nto succeed him; a man devoted to France. To that Court Lord Hertford\r\nset out on the 13th of October, and Monsieur de Guerchy arrived thence.\r\nThe Comte de Guerchy[370] was an amiable soldier; not to be named for\r\nparts, but far better qualified for his situation than his own Court\r\nbelieved, having a good knowledge of the world, a perpetual attention\r\nto his employment, consummate discretion, much natural ease in his\r\nbehaviour, with either no impertinence, or with thorough mastery of\r\nit, and a complaisance so properly applied that he was agreeable to\r\nall parties, and yet always well with the reigning ministry here. It\r\ngave him a ridicule at home, that he was enslaved to a penurious and\r\ndeformed wife; but that dominion of Madame de Guerchy was his greatest\r\nfelicity. She had an excellent understanding, and a talent for learning\r\nthe tempers, humours, and connections of England; her constant\r\napplication to which, and the necessary curiosity in consequence, were\r\nconcealed by the natural coldness and reserve of her disposition. Nor\r\ndid her attention to their fortune ever disgrace her husband, nor throw\r\neven an air of economy on his table. At Paris her devotion and domestic\r\nretirement had passed for insipid virtues that prevented her good sense\r\nfrom being so much as suspected. At the Count’s first audience he told\r\nthe King, with pleasant candour, _that it was a proof of his master’s\r\nintentions to preserve the peace, that he was sent over, who was no man\r\nof talents or intrigue_.\r\n\r\nThus formed to succeed and never to offend, no man was more unfortunate\r\nthan this ambassador; and it required not only dexterity, but the\r\nsimplicity of his conduct, to surmount the most cruel and disagreeable\r\nideas, first carelessly dropped, and then maliciously dispersed to his\r\nprejudice. The Duc de Nivernois had brought over and left here, to\r\nmanage the affairs of their Court till M. de Guerchy’s arrival, the\r\nChevalier D’Eon,[371] a military man, but who had been much employed in\r\nsecret negotiations in Russia, for which he had been largely praised\r\nand very ill paid. The man had notable parts, great appearance of\r\nbashful merit, and learning enough to charm the superficial pedantry\r\nof the Duke, who had treated him with a fondness and intimacy that was\r\nridiculous; and that, by being over kind, proved cruel: for having to\r\nserve him made D’Eon the courier of the peace, the Duke went farther,\r\nand procured him to be styled plenipotentiary during the absence of\r\nthe ambassador. Vigils and vanity turned the poor young man’s head,\r\nwhich was by no means ballasted by a good heart. He mistook the road of\r\nfortune for fortune itself, and thought that highsounding titles lifted\r\nhim to a level with those that conferred them. He forgot his modesty,\r\nand learned to talk loftily, or, as his masters thought, arrogantly.\r\nUnder this unhappy intoxication he was thunderstruck with a declaration\r\nfrom the Duc de Nivernois, that on the ambassador’s arrival he was to\r\nsink into his pristine insignificance. To laugh this off, the Duke had\r\nfamiliarly pictured him to himself as sometimes a plenipotentiary and\r\nsometimes a tool of office. Other accidents concurred to aggravate\r\nthis mortifying notice. He could obtain no arrears; and having made\r\nfree with the remittances of his new master to give dignity to his\r\nown mission, he received a very humiliating reprimand from Monsieur\r\nde Guerchy. To crown all, Wilkes’s writings had breathed a spirit of\r\nindependence into a poor brain born to crouch at a desk or to rise by\r\nservility. The ambassador was no sooner arrived, than the Chevalier\r\nbehaved in a manner to which French ministers are little accustomed\r\nfrom their inferiors. At the same time D’Eon took it into his fancy\r\nthat one Treyssac de Vergy,[372] an adventurer, was brought over to\r\nassassinate him; and on this belief broke out so outrageously against\r\nthe Count after dinner at Lord Halifax’s, that the Earl, at M. de\r\nGuerchy’s desire, was obliged to send for Justice Fielding, and put\r\nD’Eon under arrest; and next day Vergy swore the peace[373] against\r\nhim. The consequences of this adventure will be related hereafter.\r\n\r\nAugustus the Third[374] having enjoyed but for few months the cessation\r\nof war, and of those misfortunes which a vain and impertinent\r\nfavourite[375] had drawn down upon him, died about this time, leaving\r\nPoland at liberty to get rid of a family who had sacrificed their\r\nreligion for a crown, without obtaining essential benefits for\r\nthemselves, or conferring any on subjects so dearly purchased. The new\r\nElector of Saxony, his son, was infirm in mind and body, and survived\r\nhis father not a year.\r\n\r\nWe, on whom an empty favourite had heaped little less disgrace by peace\r\nthan Count Bruhl had inflicted on Saxony by war, had occasion to feel\r\nhow wide the terror of our arms had extended our influence. The Duke\r\nof York, making the tour of the Mediterranean, and being expected at\r\nFlorence, the Pope[376] ordered Cardinal Albani to inform Sir Horace\r\nMann, the King’s minister in Tuscany, that his Royal Highness, if he\r\npleased to visit Rome, would be received there with all the honours due\r\nto his birth. The nuncio at Florence was commanded too to wait on the\r\nPrince, and repeat the same; to invite him to Rome, and to assure him\r\nof all safety, honours, and amusements. His Royal Highness accepted\r\nthe invitation; and the son of James the Second, and his grandson, a\r\ncardinal of that very church, had the mortification of being forced\r\nto retire to Albano, where they had a villa, lest they should see a\r\nheretic Duke of York courted and treated in that holy city whence the\r\nthunders of the Vatican had been hurled against the great Elizabeth.\r\nBut this was not the last nor least humiliation which the wretched\r\nand helpless line of Stuart received from the hands of their Pontiff,\r\nand from that church for which they had sacrificed themselves, their\r\ncrowns, and their posterity.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of November Charles Yorke resigned the post of\r\nAttorney-General, alleging to Mr. Grenville that his father and the\r\nDuke of Newcastle had insisted upon it. Yorke, on the trial of the\r\nprinters, had made a warm speech against Wilkes, and was to carry on\r\nthe prosecution. The father and the sons were certainly in their hearts\r\ninclined to prerogative; but interest so swayed their actions, and it\r\nwas so much the point of the whole family that Charles Yorke should be\r\nChancellor, that we shall find one perpetual stream of dubitation and\r\ntrimming run through their conduct. The father, indeed, more soured,\r\nand with pride more affronted, towards this close of his life, grew\r\nmore settled in his asperity towards the Court. Nor was he the only\r\ninstrument of prerogative whom the Court lost because it could not\r\nreward all its devotees up to their ambition.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland the scene commenced unfavourably. The new Lord Lieutenant,\r\nthe Earl of Northumberland,[377] lost a question the first day in\r\nthe House of Commons there by so considerable a number as forty, who\r\nwould not suffer the word _adequate_ to be applied to the Peace in the\r\naddress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n  Opening of Parliament.--Lord Gower and Lord Temple.--Wilkes’s\r\n    “Essay on Woman” laid before the House of Lords.--Hypocrisy of\r\n    Lord Sandwich.--Bishop Warburton.--Kidgell.--Persecution of\r\n    Wilkes.--He complains in the House of Commons of a breach of\r\n    privilege in the seizure of himself and his papers.--Warm Debate\r\n    on the question.--Mr. Pitt’s Speech.--Arguments of Lord North\r\n    and others.--Wilkes wounded in a duel by Martin.--The King’s\r\n    Speech read to the Commons.--Pitt’s obscure Speech.--Speech of\r\n    Grenville.--Postponement of the farther hearing on Wilkes.--\r\n    Bestowal of the Bishoprick of Osnabrugh.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut in the Parliament of England lay the chief seat of the war; and\r\nwith very extraordinary scenes did the campaign open. The Houses\r\nmet November 15th, Lord Hilsborough and Lord Suffolk moved the\r\nAddress of the Peers. Lord Temple censured the Peace; and the Duke\r\nof Bedford defended it with temper. Lord Gower attacked Lord Temple\r\nfor his disrespect to the King. He denied that he had ever shown any\r\ndisrespect; and said that he and his family had been attached to _this_\r\nroyal family _full as long_ as his lordship’s family had (who were very\r\nrecent converts from Jacobitism).\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Address was voted, Lord Sandwich produced a poem,\r\ncalled an Essay on Woman, with notes pretended to be written by Bishop\r\nWarburton. It was a performance bawdy and blasphemous to the last\r\ndegree, being a parody of _Pope’s Essay on Man_, and of other pieces,\r\nadapted to the grossest ideas, or to the most profane. Wilkes and\r\nPotter,[378] son of the late Archbishop of Canterbury, had formerly\r\ncomposed this indecent patchwork in some of their bacchanalian hours;\r\nand Wilkes, not content with provoking the vengeance of the King, of\r\nthe Princess, of the Favourite, of twenty subaltern ministers, and of\r\nthe whole Scottish nation, had, for the amusement of his idle hours,\r\nconsigned this _innocent_ rhapsody to his own printing-press--a folly\r\nunparalleled, though he had intended to restrain the edition to twelve\r\ncopies. However, as he could not commit a wanton imprudence without\r\ngiving birth to some villainy or tyranny in others, this very poem\r\nwas now laid before the House of Lords in consequence of a train\r\nof both kinds. One of the copies had been seized among his papers\r\nby Philip Carteret Webbe. Still was even that ministry ashamed to\r\naccuse Wilkes on evidence which had fallen into their hands by such\r\nillegal means--unanswerable proof that they were conscious of their\r\nguilt, and knew they could not justify their proceedings. But the\r\nblood-hounds having thus fallen on the scent, were not to be turned\r\naside by delicacies. Could they procure another copy the business would\r\nbe effected--and effected it was. Carteret Webbe set his tools to\r\nwork, for even hangmen have deputies. There was one Kidgell, a dainty\r\npriggish parson, much in vogue among the old ladies for his gossiping\r\nand quaint sermons, and chaplain to the Scotch[379] Earl of March. This\r\nfellow got at a proof-sheet; and by the treachery of one of Wilkes’s\r\nprinters, who thought himself ill-used, and by the encouragement of his\r\npatron, who consulted Lord Bute and Lord Sandwich, and was egged on by\r\nthem to proceed, Kidgell and Webbe purchased the whole poem: and now\r\ndid Sandwich, who had hugged this mischief for months in his breast,\r\nlay open the precious poem before his brother Lords in strains of more\r\nhypocrisy[380] than would have been tolerable even in a professed\r\nMethodist. Parts of it were read, most coarsely and disgustingly\r\nblasphemous. Lord Lyttelton groaned in spirit, and begged they might\r\nhear no more. Bishop Warburton, who had not the luck, like Lord\r\nLyttelton, to have his conversion believed by any one, foamed with the\r\nviolence of a Saint Dominic; vaunted that he had combated infidelity,\r\nand laid it under his feet; and said, the blackest fiends in hell\r\nwould not keep company with Wilkes, and then begged Satan’s pardon for\r\ncomparing them together.\r\n\r\nLord Temple had got no intelligence of this bomb, and knew little\r\nwhat to say; but concluding, justly, that the piece had been found\r\namong Wilkes’s papers, condemned the means by which it was obtained.\r\nIt was instantly voted blasphemous, and a breach of privilege against\r\nthe person of the Bishop of Gloucester. Lord Sandwich then moved that\r\nWilkes should be voted the author; but even Lord Mansfield condemned so\r\nhasty and arbitrary a course, and said it was previously necessary to\r\nhear the accused person in his own defence: on which the proceeding was\r\nadjourned to the next day but one. I was in a division in the lobby of\r\nthe House of Commons, when I heard what was passing in the other House,\r\nand immediately informed Mr. Pitt. He replied with indignation, “Why do\r\nnot they search the Bishop of Gloucester’s study for heresy?”\r\n\r\nEvents now thickened so fast, that to avoid confusion, I will here\r\nsay a little more on this head. The plot so hopefully laid to blow up\r\nWilkes, and ruin him in the estimation of all the decent and grave,\r\nhad, at least in the latter respect, scarce any effect at all. The\r\ntreachery was so gross and scandalous, so revengeful, and so totally\r\nunconnected with the political conduct of Wilkes, and the instruments\r\nso despicable, odious, or in whom any pretensions to decency,\r\nsanctimony, or faith, were so preposterous, that losing all sight of\r\nthe scandal contained in the poem, the whole world almost united in\r\ncrying out against the informers. Sandwich, in opening the discovery,\r\nhad canted till his own friends could not keep their countenances.\r\nSir Francis Dashwood was not more notorious for singing profane and\r\nlewd catches; and what aggravated the hypocrisy, scarce a fortnight\r\nhad passed since this holy Secretary of State himself had been present\r\nwith Wilkes at a weekly club to which both belonged, held at the top\r\nof Covent Garden Theatre, and composed of players and the loosest\r\nrevellers of the age. Warburton’s part was only ridiculous, and was\r\nheightened by its being known that Potter, his wife’s gallant, had had\r\nthe chief hand in the composition of the verses. However, an intimacy\r\ncommenced between the Bishop and Sandwich, and some jovial dinners\r\nand libations of champagne cemented their friendship. Kidgell, the\r\njackall, published so precise, affected, and hypocritic an account of\r\nthe transaction, that he, who might have escaped in the gloom of the\r\ntreachery, completely blasted his own reputation; and falling into\r\ndebt, was, according to the fate of inferior tools, abandoned by his\r\nmasters, and forced to fly his country. Though the rank and fortune of\r\nSandwich saved him from disgrace of that kind, he had little reason\r\nto exult in his machination. He brought a stigma on himself that\r\ncounterworked many of his own views and arts; and Churchill the poet\r\nhas branded his name on this account with lasting colours. The public\r\nindignation went so far, that the Beggar’s Opera being performed at\r\nCovent Garden Theatre soon after this event, the whole audience, when\r\nMacheath says, “_That Jemmy Twitcher should peach me, I own surprises\r\nme_,” burst out into an applause of application; and the nick-name of\r\n_Jemmy Twitcher_ stuck by the Earl so as almost to occasion the disuse\r\nof his title.\r\n\r\nWhile the destruction of the character and fortune of Wilkes was thus\r\nprosecuted in one chamber of Parliament, a plot against his life was\r\nhatching in the other; his enemies not being satisfied with all the\r\nseverities they could wring from the law to oppress him. Nor were\r\nseveral servants of the Crown sorry to make his outrages a handle for\r\ncurtailing liberty itself. The House was no sooner met, than Wilkes\r\nrose to make his complaint of the breach of privilege in the seizure\r\nof himself and his papers. The Speaker interrupted him, and said the\r\nsession was not yet open, the silly form of reading a bill not having\r\nbeen gone through. Grenville, too, urged that there was a message from\r\nthe Crown that ought to be received before any other business. Beckford\r\nand Onslow pleaded that privilege ought to take place of every other\r\nconsideration. A long and warm debate ensued. Mr. Pitt strenuously\r\nsupported the precedence of privilege, though affecting to offer to\r\ntake privilege and message together. Elliot moved to have a bill\r\nread. Pitt replied admirably, and said, if they were not yet a House,\r\nno member could have been sworn; nor was it necessary to have some\r\nnonsense read to which nobody would attend. Suppose it should have been\r\nforgotten, and the House had entered on some arduous business, some\r\nfool of form might have started up and told them,--“Lord bless us!\r\nit is all a nullity that we have been doing!” Privilege waived would\r\nreally nullify the proceedings. The House would be a company of men put\r\nunder force. The man who would waive privilege ought to have a question\r\nmoved on him. Lord North, Nugent, and Dyson argued against privilege,\r\nand warm words passed between Pitt on one side, Grenville and Norton\r\non the other. Yorke said, that if they did not begin regularly with a\r\nbill, Westminster Hall would not know how to date the commencement of\r\nthe session, unless the two Houses started together. Pitt replied, that\r\nif the House should sit till three in the morning, it would still be\r\ndeemed the 15th of November. The House divided at six in the evening,\r\nand it was carried, by 300 to 111, that a bill should first be read.\r\nGrenville then delivered the message from the Crown, acquainting the\r\nHouse with the imprisonment that had been made of one of their members;\r\nfor which message Lord North moved the thanks of the House; together\r\nwith an assurance that they would forthwith go into the consideration\r\nof the offence. Wilkes then made his complaint. Mr. Pitt approved\r\nof Lord North’s motion of thanks, but spoke against precipitation.\r\nWilkes’s case, he said, was not to be paralleled. He desired to be\r\ntried by his peers,--and if he did not, said Pitt, I would force him.\r\nThe North Briton No. 45 was then read; and two printers being examined,\r\none said he had received it from Wilkes in his own hand-writing; the\r\nother, that Wilkes and Churchill were the authors of that periodic\r\npaper in general. Lord North, who had undertaken the conduct of the\r\nparliamentary prosecution against Wilkes, held forth on the sedition\r\nof those papers, and of No. 45 in particular. Wilkes replied, his\r\nLordship, however, had not proved that it contained any falsehoods.\r\nMr. Pitt said it was a scandalous, licentious paper, and false; but\r\nalways distinguishing between the criminal and the illegal proceedings\r\nof the Ministers. The House, he said, was not a proper place for trying\r\na libel; nor did this tend to excite traitorous insurrections. Was\r\nthe motion calculated, by inserting the word _traitorous_, to justify\r\nwhat the Ministers had done? He himself could never learn exactly\r\nwhat was a libel. Whoever was the patron of these doctrines, fœnum\r\nhabet in cornu. Norton said he did think the paper tended to excite\r\ninsurrections. Scandalous reflections on private men or magistrates\r\nwere a libel. Opposing law was treason. Pitt replied, a libel could not\r\nbe treason. It might, said North, tend to excite treason. Pitt moved to\r\nomit the epithet _traitorous_, but the Ministry upholding it, the House\r\ndivided at eleven at night, and the ministerial phrase was carried by\r\n273 against 111; Sir Alexander Gilmour and Murray, two Scots, and the\r\nonly two of that nation in opposition, voting with the rest of their\r\ncountrymen on that occasion. Lord North then moved to have the paper\r\nburned by the hangman, which was ordered. Lord North affirmed next,\r\nthat privilege did not extend to libels, nor to stay justice; which\r\nPitt said was the boldest assertion and attempt ever made without\r\nconsulting precedents or appointing a committee. He lamented the King\r\nwas so ill served as to run aground on the liberties of Parliament. He\r\nwould die, he said, if a day were not appointed for hearing Wilkes.\r\nNorton took this up hotly, and said he was called upon by insult and\r\nabuse. Pitt replied, that he had said the King had been ill served\r\nby lawyers and others; and he proposed to take the case of privilege\r\ninto consideration the next day, and on the following day to hear the\r\ncomplaint of Wilkes; which was agreed to at one in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe next day when I went down to the House, I found all the members\r\nstanding on the floor in great hubbub, questioning, hearing, and\r\neagerly discussing I knew not what. I soon learned that Wilkes about\r\ntwo hours before had been dangerously wounded by Martin in a duel. In\r\nthe foregoing spring, Wilkes, in one of his North Britons, had pointed\r\nout Martin by name as a low fellow, and dirty tool of power. Martin\r\nhad stomached, not digested this; but in the debate on No. 45 the day\r\nbefore, he had risen and called the author of that paper on himself a\r\ncowardly, scandalous, and malignant scoundrel, and had repeated the\r\nwords twice, trembling with rage. Wilkes took no notice; and as he\r\ndid not, the House did not interfere, as is usual, when personalities\r\nhappen, and seem to threaten a duel. The next morning Wilkes wrote\r\nto Martin, to ask if the words used the day before were meant to be\r\naddressed to him as the supposed author of the paper in which Martin\r\nhad been abused. If Martin had thus intended to point the words, Wilkes\r\nowned he had written that paper. Martin replied, he had meant him,\r\nWilkes; and as the latter had avowed himself the author, he should not\r\ndeny, added Martin, what he had said before five hundred people, and\r\ngave him a challenge. About noon they went into Hyde-park; Martin\r\nalone; Wilkes, with Humphrey Cotes[381] in a post-chaise, knowing if he\r\nkilled Martin that he should have no chance of pardon. Cotes waited at\r\na distance. They changed pistols, both fired, and both missed. Martin\r\nfired a second time, and lodged a ball in Wilkes’s side, who was going\r\nto fire, but dropped his pistol. The wound, though not mortal, proved a\r\nbad one.\r\n\r\nIt was thought an ill symptom of Martin’s heroism, that he had\r\nsmothered the affront for so many months, nor had given vent to his\r\nresentment, till the affair with Forbes had left a doubt on Wilkes’s\r\ncourage. If Martin got rid of this imputation, it was but at the\r\nexpense of a worse charge. It came out, nor could he deny it, that\r\nhis neighbours in the country had observed him practising to fire at\r\na target for the whole summer. I shall not be thought to have used\r\ntoo hard an expression, when I called this a plot against the life of\r\nWilkes. Churchill wrote _The Duellist_, one of his finest satires, on\r\nthis occasion.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th, the King’s speech was read to the Commons, when Lord\r\nCaernarvon[382] and Lord Frederick Campbell moved the Address. Pitt\r\nmade an obscure speech, parts of which seemed to aim at explaining\r\nhis conduct in the late negotiation; but all that could be gathered\r\nfrom it was, that he had not excommunicated the Peace-makers, nor the\r\nTories; that he had aimed most at Lord Mansfield, and that he took\r\nup the Whigs, but not as enemies to prerogative.[383] He could not\r\nallow, he said, the words _safe and honourable Peace_ in the Address;\r\nhe did not think it was either; it was _durante bene placito_ of France\r\nand Spain: yet as the Address precluded nobody from speaking their\r\nsentiment afterwards, he should let the words pass. For himself, no\r\nminister could know less what to do with the Peace; nor did any man\r\nmore bid adieu to the political world than he did. He was against\r\nreviving party-names; but if dissension arose on principles, he must\r\nagain become a party-man. Grenville taking hold of Beckford’s objecting\r\nto the proclamation for settling America, made artful advantage of the\r\nopportunity to show the great pains taken by the Ministry to settle\r\nour conquests and colonies, and to regulate the finances at home. In\r\none article they had struck off 250,000_l._ of the demands made from\r\nGermany. He then expatiated on the profusion of the war, and attacked\r\nPitt strongly without reserve or fear. The Address was voted without a\r\nnegative.\r\n\r\nThe farther hearing on Wilkes was deferred on account of his\r\nwound.[384] After the debate Pitt had a meeting with the Dukes of\r\nNewcastle, Devonshire, and their friends, and insisted on their\r\nsupporting Chief Justice Pratt’s opinion in behalf of privilege against\r\nMr. Yorke, who had declared that Wilkes’s case was not within the pale\r\nof privilege.\r\n\r\nDuring these transactions, the King, after keeping the bishoprick of\r\nOsnabrugh open near three years, contrary to the custom, which allows\r\nbut six months, bestowed it on his son, a new-born child,[385] before\r\nit was christened. The Duke of York[386] had thought it his due, and\r\nnot without reason. It could not be conferred on the Prince of Wales;\r\nnor was there much equity in reserving it for a son that might be born.\r\nThe interest of the family and of the Protestant cause, too, seemed to\r\npoint out the Duke, as an infant liable to so many accidents might,\r\nif born, soon fail, and then the turn would revolve to the Papists;\r\neven a minor in possession was favourable too, to that party, for of\r\nthe revenue, which is about 25,000_l._ a year, only 2000_l._ belong to\r\nthe Bishop till he is eighteen, and the rest is divided amongst the\r\nPopish chapter. But the Queen, who began to get weight with her husband\r\nin German affairs, prevailed to reserve for, and then to grant this\r\ngreat provision to, a child of her own; and the Duke of York’s little\r\nreverence for his mother, and antipathy to the Favourite, excluded him\r\nfrom a grace for which he had so much occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n  Important Question as to the Privilege of Parliament.--Liberty of\r\n    the Press.--Scandalous Resignation of Privilege by the House\r\n    of Commons.--Abandonment of General Warrants.--Debate on the\r\n    proceedings against Wilkes.--“The Moderator,” a new scurrilous\r\n    paper.--Lord Clive.--Riot on the attempt to burn “The North\r\n    Briton.”--Debate on this subject in the House of Lords.--Triumph\r\n    of Wilkes in his prosecution against the Under-Secretary of\r\n    State.--Dismissals by the Court.--The Chevalier d’Eon.--Attempt\r\n    to assassinate Wilkes.--The East India Company and Lord Clive.--\r\n    Wilkes and the Parliament.--Outlawry against Wilkes.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of November came on the important question whether the\r\nPrivilege of Parliament preserved the members from being taken up for\r\nwriting and publishing libels. At first sight, a disinterested person\r\nwould perhaps think it strange that it should be a question whether\r\na seat in the Legislature should not secure the Legislators from the\r\npenalty of breaking the laws, for publishing a libel is undoubtedly\r\nillegal; but to those acquainted with our Constitution, it will perhaps\r\nappear more extraordinary that a House of Commons should suffer such\r\na question to be proposed to them, and that they should condescend to\r\nagitate it. Will our posterity believe that a House of Commons gave it\r\nup? but it was _that_ House of Commons that had sold itself to approve\r\nthe late Peace. Still it is to be admired that this cessation of their\r\nprivileges should be wrung from them, after the Court of Common Pleas\r\nhad declared that Privilege held against everything but treason,\r\nfelony, and breach of the peace. A libel, at most, but _tended_ to a\r\nbreach of the peace.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature consists of the three branches of Kings, Lords, and\r\nCommons. Together they form our invaluable Constitution, and each\r\nis a check on the other two. But it must be remembered, at the same\r\ntime, that while any two are checking, the third is naturally aiming\r\nat extending and aggrandizing its power. The House of Commons has not\r\nseldom made this attempt, like the rest. The Lords, as a permanent\r\nand as a proud body, more constantly aim at it: the Crown always. Of\r\nliberty, a chief and material engine is the liberty of the Press: a\r\nprivilege for ever sought to be stifled and annihilated by the Crown.\r\nThe ministers of the Crown and its lawyers must misrepresent the\r\nliberty of the Press before they can presume to request the suppression\r\nof it. Every grievance set forth in print is misnamed a libel; and\r\ngrave laws necessarily disapprove libels. If the Crown can arrive\r\nat precluding Members of Parliament from complaining in print of\r\ngrievances, no doubt the Crown could debar all other men, who are of\r\nless importance, and whose persons are guarded by no sacred privilege.\r\nLiberty of speech and liberty of writing are the two instruments by\r\nwhich Englishmen call on one another to defend their common rights.\r\nLiberty of speech is communicated but a little way; the Press gives\r\nwings to that voice, and all men may read what all cannot hear. Freedom\r\nof speech in Parliament is not so valuable as freedom of writing. A\r\nman may hazard many necessary truths in print, when he may conceal\r\nhis name, which he might not venture to utter in open Parliament.\r\nIf discovered, his privilege used to be his security. Nor is this\r\na vindication of libels, properly so called; but a Court will call\r\na libel the most just censure of tyranny. Yet could it not wrest\r\nfrom Members of Parliament the safety of their persons without their\r\nown consent--and in what instance did the Court ask this?--in what\r\ninstance did the House of Commons yield it? Mr. Wilkes, one of their\r\nown members, had been taken up by a _General Warrant_, in which his\r\nname had not so much as been mentioned. Contrary to all precedent,\r\nhe had been committed _close_ prisoner to the Tower--a proceeding\r\nso arbitrary, that a Court of Law had set him free. The House of\r\nCommons sacrificed him and their own privileges, and yet shame--I mean\r\ndisgrace, so soon overtook them, that _General Warrants_, such as that\r\non which Wilkes was arrested, were given up, condemned, exploded--but\r\nhalf the wound remains, for this scandalous vote was never rescinded!\r\n\r\nIt is true, that on the debate it did appear that there were many\r\nand many precedents on both sides. Often had privilege protected a\r\nmember--often it had not; but how did that happen to be the case? It\r\nhappened, because there had been various cases in which the Crown\r\nwas not concerned, but where the contest had lain between subject\r\nand subject; and in those instances the House had often determined\r\ndifferent ways. But on the great case of the seven Bishops, in the\r\nreign of James the Second, Privilege of Parliament had been vindicated\r\nand secured. What would have become of those prelates if the Court had\r\nhad this precedent of Wilkes to justify its violence? Even allowing\r\nthat privilege were not inherent in members, but had been decided\r\nsometimes for, sometimes against them; was this a time--was this an\r\ninstance, in which the House should have waived its pretensions? Was\r\nthe blow it gave itself likely to be repaired? But let the preceding\r\nand subsequent conduct of this ductile and servile House of Commons\r\ntell its motives!\r\n\r\nThe debates were not brilliant, but serious and solemn as the occasion\r\nrequired. Lord North[387] was the chief manager for the Court,\r\nsupported by Norton, George Grenville, Morton,[388] and Elliot. Lord\r\nNorth’s mouthing and boisterous manner, his coarse figure, and rude\r\nuntempered style, contributed to make the cause into which he had\r\nunnecessarily thrust himself appear still more odious. Pitt, Beckford,\r\nLegge, Sir George Saville, Sir William Baker, and James Grenville\r\ndefended the Constitution. Much was said on the danger to which every\r\nman’s private papers were now exposed, and more on the injustice of\r\nhurrying on this decision, when Wilkes could not for his wound appear\r\nto defend himself, when he was prosecuting both the Secretaries of\r\nState and the messengers, and when he was to be tried himself for\r\nthe libel. What court, what judge, what jury, but must be prejudiced\r\nby a decision of the House of Commons against him? This plea was\r\nglaring, was crying. The lawyers themselves many of them allowed it,\r\nand the debate took that turn; the Opposition endeavouring to stave\r\noff the question on Privilege, the courtiers insisting to bring it\r\non. Charles Yorke begged for delay, but it was a delay of a few days;\r\nEliab Harvey, though bred a Tory, pleaded for deferring their decision.\r\nForester, a Scot devoted to the Duke of Bedford,[389] and reckoned no\r\nsqueamish lawyer, spoke for procrastination, and voted against the\r\nCourt. Wedderburne, another Scot, argued for farther time; and even\r\nold Wilbraham,[390] the Gamaliel of the Jacobites, could not digest\r\nsuch indecent hurry, for which he was much commended by Pitt; yet by\r\nseven in the evening the Court bore down all obstruction, and carried\r\ntheir point by 243 to 166; though Sir John Philipps and Benjamin\r\nBathurst,[391] two high-prerogative men, were in the minority, with\r\nGlover, and four general officers--Conway, Sir John Griffin,[392]\r\nA’Court,[393] and Honeywood.[394] It being, however, too late to\r\ncommence the regular debate, it was adjourned till the next day.\r\n\r\nThe 24th, a letter from Wilkes was presented, protesting against their\r\nproceedings, and promising on his honour to attend in his place as\r\nsoon as possible. To this no regard was paid, Grenville moving for\r\nthe orders of the day, and Rigby saying that Wilkes could not have\r\nwritten that letter but on misrepresentation of what had passed the\r\nday before. Hussey, the Queen’s Solicitor, a man of most fair life,\r\nunambitious, uninterested, candid in his conduct, and gracefully\r\ntouching in his delivery, a great friend of Pratt, and lover of the\r\nConstitution, made an excellent speech in behalf of privilege and\r\nliberty. Charles Yorke, under the difficulties of disgusting his Whig\r\nfriends and of serving a Court with which he was dissatisfied, explored\r\nall the sources of distinction and law subtleties, to defend his\r\nopinion against privilege; and spoke for two hours with great applause,\r\nas excellent in that branch of his profession. Pitt, near as long\r\non the audaciousness of the Crown’s servants, and their contempt of\r\nParliament; declaring that this proceeding was making a surrender from\r\nthat day of every man’s liberty in the House to the discretion of the\r\nSecretary of State. Pitt was ill, and then went away. Norton indecently\r\nquoted a prosecution for perjury against Sir John Rushout,[395] the\r\nmost ancient member of the House, then sitting at the end of the same\r\nbench. The old gentleman was stout and choleric: the prosecution had\r\nbeen on a case of election, and he had been acquitted. He rose with\r\nwarmth, but with much propriety told his story; showed the prosecution\r\nhad been instigated by Norton himself, to serve an election purpose;\r\nand, looking defiance at that attorney, said, “It was all owing to that\r\n_honest_ gentleman!--I hope I do not call him out of his name!” The\r\nshout of the House did justice on Norton.\r\n\r\nThis interlude, however, was decent and calm in comparison of what\r\nfollowed. Rigby, looking at Lord Temple, who was sitting at the end\r\nof the House, to hear the debate, as he constantly practised, drew\r\na picture of that incendiary peer, described him in his blue riband\r\nencouraging mobs from windows of coffee-houses; and more particularly\r\nas the instigator of Wilkes. James Grenville rose, in amazing heat,\r\nto defend his brother, and vomited out a torrent of invectives on\r\nRigby, telling him of his interestedness and ignorance; harangued on\r\nso illiterate a man being a Master of the Rolls;[396] and painted his\r\nflying from Ireland to avoid being hanged by the enraged populace. This\r\nphilippic was uttered with every vehemence of language and gesture;\r\nthe bitterest terms flowing spontaneously from him, who had ever been\r\nthe most obscure and unready speaker: and what added to the outrage of\r\nthe diction was, that sitting on the bench immediately above Rigby, and\r\ndashing about his arm in the air, he seemed to aim blows at the latter,\r\nwho was forced to crouch lest he should receive them. Grenville had no\r\nsooner finished, than the Speaker interposed--indeed of the latest.\r\nRigby replied, with ease enough, that in Ireland the Mastership of the\r\nRolls was a sinecure, and a man as ignorant as he was might execute the\r\noffice. The House then insisted on their giving their words that this\r\naltercation should have no consequences. Grenville, sitting obstinate\r\nand mute, Rigby gave his word it should end there; and then Grenville\r\nin like manner.\r\n\r\nThe candour of Wilbraham and Philipps on the preceding day had\r\nsatisfied their consciences, and they both now spoke, and voted with\r\nthe majority. The House dividing at one in the morning, 258 voted for\r\nrelinquishing their privilege; only 133 for maintaining it. Lord North\r\nthen moved to communicate their resolutions to the Lords, which was\r\nagreed to.\r\n\r\nA conference being accordingly demanded, and held next day, the Lords,\r\nthough in a very thin House, and though no important business is\r\nagitated there without summoning the Peers [a respect their Lordships\r\nhave often paid even to a turnpike-bill], were precipitately proceeding\r\nto pass the like votes with the Commons; but the Duke of Richmond,\r\nthough acting with the Court, was struck with the indecency, and on\r\nstating it, the House did agree to summon the Lords for the 29th.\r\nDecency thus satisfied, their Lordships on the 29th, in happy harmony\r\nwith the other House, made a parallel compliment of their privilege\r\nto the Crown. One hundred and fourteen were thus loyal: the Duke\r\nof Cumberland and thirty-four more were the minority. The Duke of\r\nNewcastle defended the warrant of the Secretaries, but voted against\r\nthe resolutions. The Chancellor[397] was very warm; said he did not\r\nwish to see the House unanimous; unanimity had cost the nation sixty\r\nmillions.[398] Lord Temple disculpated himself from encouraging the\r\ngeneral satire in the North Britons, and said he had always condemned\r\nthe attack on the Scotch and on the Tories in that paper. He brought a\r\nprotest, drawn, as was supposed, by Lord Chief Justice Pratt, and the\r\nlongest on record, and signed it with fifteen other Lords.\r\n\r\nAt this very period that Court and Parliament were raging so hotly\r\nagainst libels, a new paper, called the Moderator, appeared. It was\r\nso scurrilous against the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, that his\r\nCourt took up the printer. The man owned directly that it was written\r\nby Carteret Webbe, Solicitor of the Treasury, and by Dr. Shebbeare,\r\nwho, having been committed to Newgate by the King’s Bench in the late\r\nreign for abusing King William and the House of Hanover, had been\r\ngratified by a pension of 200_l._ a year by Lord Bute; and was a proper\r\nchampion of measures so dissonant from those of King William, and from\r\nthose to which the House of Hanover owed the Crown.\r\n\r\nLord Clive had last year been thrown out of his directorship of the\r\nEast India Company by the intrigues of Fox; and the new directors had\r\ngone so far as to deprive him of his jaguire, a revenue of 25,000_l._\r\na year conferred on him by the Nabob. This act had driven Lord Clive,\r\nwith five members brought into Parliament by him, into opposition.\r\nGrenville, to gain a man so important, promised that vast revenue\r\nshould be restored to him, or an equivalent given; but Walsh, one of\r\nthe five, said he could not in conscience vote with such iniquitous\r\nmen, and offered to vacate his seat: Lord Clive refusing to accept it,\r\nWalsh abstained from attendance on the House.\r\n\r\nThe 3rd of December had been appointed for burning the North Briton at\r\nthe Royal Exchange; but when the magistrates were assembled for that\r\npurpose, and the executioner began to perform the ceremony, a great\r\nriot ensued, the paper was forced from the hangman, the constables\r\nwere pelted and beaten, and Mr. Harley,[399] one of the sheriffs, had\r\nthe glass of his coach broken, and himself was wounded in the face by\r\na billet snatched from the fire that was lighted to burn the paper,\r\nand thrown at him. The cry was “Wilkes and liberty!” A jack-boot and a\r\npetticoat--the mob’s hieroglyphics for Lord Bute and the Princess, were\r\nburned with great triumph and acclamations.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th the Duke of Bedford, who had moved that the Commons might\r\nbe desired to permit Mr. Harley, member for the City, to attend the\r\nHouse of Lords, called on him, and Blount, the other sheriff, to give\r\nan account of the late riot. They said the mob had been encouraged\r\nby gentlemen from windows and balconies, particularly from the Union\r\ncoffee-house. One low man had been taken into custody; another had\r\nbeen rescued by the rioters. One witness said the mob had united\r\ntwo respectable names in a cry of approbation, those of the Duke of\r\nCumberland and Lord Temple, and he had joined in that shout. The Duke\r\nof Grafton shrewdly told the marshal’sman he must have seen many\r\nmobs of party against party; had there appeared two parties on this\r\noccasion? “No,” replied the fellow, “all were of one mind.” The Duke\r\nof Bedford, sputtering with zeal and indiscretion, broke forth against\r\nBridgen, the Lord Mayor, and the other magistrates, who, though within\r\nhearing, had taken no pains to quell the mob. “Such behaviour,” he\r\nsaid, “in any smaller town would have forfeited their franchises.\r\nThe Common Council had long been setting themselves up against the\r\nParliament, and last year had taken on them to advise the King to\r\nrefuse his assent to a law[400] that had passed through both Houses.\r\nHe hoped their Lordships would resent this insult and disrespect to\r\ntheir orders.” The Chancellor, alarmed at this injudicious attack on\r\nthe City, said it would be right to proceed without delay against the\r\nactors and abettors of the riot; but without farther proofs, he would\r\nnot believe the magistrates of London guilty. He moved to vote the\r\nrioters perturbators of the peace. This was voted, and thanks to the\r\nsheriffs for their behaviour. The Duke of Richmond seconded the Duke\r\nof Bedford in his violence against the City, and in a proposal of\r\noffering rewards for discovery of the ringleaders, and for committees\r\nof inquiry. Lord Mansfield and Lord Lyttelton interposed to disculpate\r\nthe magistrates, and obtained to adjourn; the former saying, that no\r\ndoubt the magistrates were actually at that time sifting to the bottom\r\nof the commotion. The Lords then conferred with the House of Commons,\r\nwhere Rigby tried to propagate his master’s[401] spirit, and to get the\r\nLord Mayor censured; but, on reflection, the ministers chose to pass\r\nover the insult, rather than quarrel seriously with the City of London.\r\nThey all, therefore, concurred to excuse the magistracy; and the affair\r\nwas dropped in an address to the King to order the offenders to be\r\nbrought to justice.[402]\r\n\r\nThe Common Council, neither intimidated nor imitating the moderation of\r\nParliament, put a negative on a motion for thanking the sheriffs, and\r\nfor prosecuting Franklin, the fellow apprehended in the tumult.\r\n\r\nWilkes, in the meantime, went on triumphantly with his prosecutions;\r\nand on the 6th of December, obtained a verdict of 1000_l._ damages, and\r\ncosts of suit, against Mr. Wood, the Under-Secretary of State.[403]\r\n\r\nThe Court was exerting its authority on the other hand. Lord Shelburne\r\nwas dismissed from being aide-de-camp to the King; Colonel Barré from\r\nbeing Adjutant-general and Governor of Stirling Castle; and Calcraft\r\nlost some little places, which served to provoke more than to hurt him.\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier d’Eon, the mimic of Wilkes, was less fortunate. Being\r\nrecalled by his Court, and refusing to return, he was declared to be\r\nno longer employed here in a public character, and was accordingly\r\nforbidden to appear at St. James’s.[404]\r\n\r\nWhile the world was anxiously expecting the event of Wilkes’s affair,\r\nprotracted by his wound, a new alarm was given of an intention to\r\nmurder him. Mr. Onslow on the 9th acquainted the House of Commons that\r\none Alexander Dun, a Scotchman, had on false pretences got into Mr.\r\nWilkes’s house the night before, intending to assassinate him. A person\r\nwho appeared, and made oath that he had heard this Dun declare that he\r\nand twelve more had made a vow to murder Wilkes, had given notice to\r\nthe latter of their design, on which he had prepared persons to seize\r\nthe assassin, which they had done. A new penknife was found upon him,\r\nand he prevaricated on the time and place of buying it. The House the\r\nnext day examined witnesses on this accusation; but it being proved\r\nthat Dun had been discharged from a ship as a lunatic, he was dismissed\r\nout of custody. But the multitude were far from not continuing to\r\nbelieve the plot (nor indeed was a madman an improper subject to be\r\nset on, if there was such a design), and the animosity against the\r\nScotch was accordingly augmented. About the same time the printers of\r\nthe North Briton obtained in the Court of Common Pleas damages to the\r\namount of four hundred pounds against the messengers of the Secretary’s\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe East India Company were untractable, too, and came to an unanimous\r\nresolution of neither restoring his jaguire to Lord Clive, nor of\r\nallowing him three hundred thousand pounds, which the ministry had\r\nengaged to obtain for him in lieu of it. It occasioned much diversion\r\nthat his father, an old unfashioned man, who did not understand how\r\ndecently corruption was practised, and how ridiculous it is to talk\r\nof what few are ashamed of doing, being asked by the King, in the\r\ndrawing-room, where his son Lord Clive was, replied, with all the\r\nhonesty of bargain and sale, “He is coming to town, Sir, and then your\r\nMajesty will have another vote.”\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons having ordered that Wilkes should appear before\r\nthem on the 24th, and suspecting that his delays were affected, Lord\r\nNorth, George Grenville, and Rigby, in a very thin House, proposed that\r\nDr. Heberden, and Mr. Hawkins the surgeon, should be ordered to attend\r\nhim. This was warmly opposed; and Charles Townshend, who knew that\r\nPitt was provoked at his late silence, and who saw Grenville and North\r\ntowering above him, and perhaps offended too that the Court seemed to\r\ndespise him, broke out with much vehemence, turned Lord North into\r\nridicule, and being told by Grenville that it would be wiser to submit\r\nto this motion, replied, he should often differ with that gentleman,\r\nand hoped he should not have more wisdom to encounter than he had met\r\nwith that day. The motion was carried by 71 to 30. Wilkes, however,\r\nwould not admit the parliamentary physician and surgeon; and, to add\r\nmockery to disobedience, sent for Doctors Duncan and Middleton, two\r\nScotchmen. He had at first, at Martin’s request, who fled to Calais\r\ntill Wilkes was out of danger consulted both Hawkins and Heberden.\r\nBeing told that he must see little company for fear of augmenting\r\nhis fever, he said, “I will not see so much as my own wife,”--I had\r\nmentioned that they were parted.\r\n\r\nIt was to the no small satisfaction of the Ministry that on the 26th\r\nthey heard that Wilkes was privately gone off to France. It was a sort\r\nof confession of guilt, disburthened them of the odium of punishing him\r\npersonally, and left them at liberty to rage against him by outlawry\r\nand forfeitures. With a proper executioner they had just provided\r\nthemselves, having raised Norton to be Attorney-General. He was\r\nsucceeded as Solicitor by De Grey,[405] a man of a fair character and\r\nmoderate principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n  Lord Sandwich’s unpopularity.--He offers himself for the High\r\n    Stewardship of Cambridge.--Animosity between him and Lord Royston,\r\n    the other candidate.--Lord Sandwich’s “Flying Pension.”--\r\n    Disgraceful Grant to Count Virri.--Dismissal of General A’Court.--\r\n    Grenville, Walpole, and General Conway.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effects of Lord Sandwich’s conduct began already to be felt. He\r\nhaving, to thwart the Duke of Cumberland, who espoused Mr. Luther,\r\ntaken the opposite side on the election for the county of Essex,[406]\r\nthe Court lost the election by dint of Sandwich’s unpopularity. He\r\nhimself, foreseeing the approaching death of Lord Hardwicke, presented\r\nhimself as candidate for the High Stewardship of Cambridge. Nothing\r\ncould occasion greater ridicule than a character so flagitious offered\r\nto a religious and learned society. It counter-worked even his own\r\nindefatigable industry. Lord Royston,[407] son of Lord Hardwicke, was\r\nthe other candidate; and the animosities ran so high, that the two\r\nparties preached against each other. The sequel will appear hereafter.\r\nIn the meantime Sandwich obtained what was called a _flying pension_,\r\nthat is, it was to commence if he lost his place. The grant was of\r\n3000_l._ a year on Ireland; but when the order went to Dublin, Lord\r\nNorthumberland, having promised that no addition should be made to\r\nthe pension-list during his administration, was forced to represent\r\nso strongly against what was granted to Lord Sandwich, that the Court\r\nwas obliged to recall it. The Irish House of Commons had just then set\r\nitself to examine the state of pensions charged on that country, and\r\nit had been found, as they published to the world in their votes, that\r\nsince the commencement of this reign, a period only of three years,\r\n17,000_l._ a year had been added to that list. There likewise appeared\r\nthe disgraceful grant to Count Virri, the purchase of the peace. It\r\nstood in the name of one Charles.\r\n\r\nThe year concluded with the dismission of General A’Court, whose\r\nregiment was taken from him for having voted for the Privilege of\r\nParliament. The man was obscure and of no importance, had a large\r\nfamily and no fortune;[408] the tyranny therefore was the more\r\nflagrant, but from those very circumstances made the less noise. Lord\r\nSandwich had carried into the King a list of sixteen officers who\r\nhad dared to act with spirit and independence against the arbitrary\r\nmeasures of the Court. The poor man in question was selected for an\r\nexample of terror; but, except in his ruin, the ministers found no\r\ncause to exult. A much more considerable man had taken the same part,\r\nof which it is necessary here to give some account.\r\n\r\nI have said that General Conway,[409] under pretence of bringing\r\nhome the troops, had been kept abroad till the peace was voted, the\r\nministers apprehending that they should not be able to influence him\r\nto approve an event so ruinous and shameful to his country. At his\r\nreturn, no man being less factious, he had entered into no cabals,\r\nhad attached himself to no party. His chief friendships were with the\r\nDuke of Devonshire, with his own brother the Earl of Hertford, and\r\nwith me. The Duke, though grievously insulted and provoked, was of so\r\ndecent and cautious a nature, that he was the last man on earth to\r\nthink of exciting his friends to violent measures; and, indeed, after\r\nthe first sally of passion, bore his affront with too much patience.\r\nLord Hertford was a perfect courtier, and more likely to dissuade his\r\nbrother from, than incite him to, Opposition. I, much more inclined\r\nto party-heat, had been very seriously alarmed at the strides I had\r\nseen made towards arbitrary power; but having beheld the cowardice of\r\nLord Bute, and knowing that of Lord Mansfield, and finding the nation\r\ndelivered from the influence of Fox, I had flattered myself the danger\r\nwas over. I had been pleased, too, that Grenville was become the acting\r\nminister; having (I confess my blindness) entertained a most favourable\r\nopinion of his integrity. He talked nothing but reformation--which,\r\nindeed, alone, would not have duped me--I had seen too much of patriot\r\nhypocrisy! but he went beyond myself in his principles of liberty--I\r\nmean, in his discourse. I thought him a grounded Republican; had\r\nheard him harangue by the hour against the despotic doctrines of Lord\r\nMansfield. Nor had his venal prostitution of himself to Lord Bute as\r\nyet opened my eyes. But I was again roused by the arbitrary treatment\r\nof Wilkes, committed close prisoner to the Tower by an indefinite\r\nwarrant. Lord Bute, I saw, had left his cloak to his successors; yet\r\nI could not believe that my friend, Algernon Sydney, (for Grenville\r\nappeared to me as scarce a less Whig saint,) was capable of concurring\r\nin such measures. In truth, when I saw Saint Sandwich added to his\r\nrubric, I began to be startled. I saw him lean, too, on the Bedfords:\r\nthem I did not love: and nothing is a more sovereign cure for\r\nblindness in friendship, than a connection between one’s friends and\r\none’s enemies. I laboured by those most in Grenville’s confidence\r\nto detach him from so disreputable an union; but Grenville knew his\r\ninterest better than I knew him. Still I had not the most distant\r\nsuspicion of what his heart was capable of, nor any view of opposing\r\nhis administration. Thinking him as frank and candid as myself, and\r\nthoroughly shocked at the use made of General Warrants, I desired Mr.\r\nThomas Pitt,[410] attached to Mr. Grenville, and my own friend, to\r\ntell him fairly in the summer, that I believed I should differ with him\r\nwhen the point of General Warrants should be agitated in Parliament.\r\nBut not content with opposing them myself, I earnestly desired that\r\nMr. Conway should take the same step: and in bringing that about, I\r\nby no means piqued myself on the same frankness. Should Lord Hertford\r\nconceive the least suspicion of my intentions, I knew how sedulously\r\nhe would labour to prevent his brother from involving himself against\r\nthe Court. He might procure Mr. Conway to be again sent aside on some\r\nhonourable commission, or contrive to have his gratitude dipped in\r\nfavours from the King, before he should be aware with what view they\r\nwere bestowed. I waited therefore in silence and patience till Lord\r\nHertford was set out on his embassy to Paris, before I ever named the\r\nterm _General Warrants_ in the presence of Mr. Conway. Then, indeed,\r\nI asked him, as by accident, how he intended to vote on that business,\r\ntelling him I should wish to act as he did. I found he was disgusted\r\nat the Warrants; and thence I easily entered into agreement with him\r\nto oppose them, as we did, no other person living having any previous\r\nintimation of his intention. The Court was alarmed; and Grenville sent\r\nMr. Thomas Pitt to me to sound me on that head; both of them believing\r\nthat I had rather been influenced by Conway, than he by me.\r\n\r\nPitt began with Mr. Grenville’s concern at Mr. Conway’s behaviour,\r\nwished to know what had disgusted him, and was ready to obtain for\r\nhim whatever his warmest wishes could aim at. I assured him he was\r\nthoroughly mistaken; that no disgust had taken possession of Mr.\r\nConway; that no man was less ambitious; and that I advised Mr.\r\nGrenville, as a friend, not to think of treating Mr. Conway as a man to\r\nbe bought. _That_ really would disgust him, and might throw him into\r\nOpposition, of which I was sure at present he had no thoughts,--and\r\nthus far I really spoke with good wishes to Mr. Grenville,--but the\r\nscene soon changed. Finding bribes rejected, Pitt altered his tone:\r\nsaid it could not be suffered to have men in the King’s service acting\r\nagainst him,--and then dropped this unguarded expression, _the King\r\ncould not trust his army in such hands_. I started. “Good God!” said\r\nI, “Mr. Pitt, what are they going to do with the army? to what use is\r\nit to be put, if a man of Mr. Conway’s virtue, and tried loyalty and\r\nbravery, cannot be trusted with a regiment? You alarm me!” He beat\r\nabout backwards and forwards: sometimes it was offers and promises,\r\nsometimes threats; but I had taken my part, and had got hold of words\r\nI was determined not to part with or forget. I would say no more, but\r\nthat I advised Mr. Grenville to have patience; that I knew Mr. Conway\r\nneither was in, nor was going into, Opposition (for they were jealous\r\nof his connection with the Duke of Devonshire), and that I was sure\r\nhe would never be influenced, would never act but from principle;\r\nand if they would leave him to himself they would have no reason to\r\nbe dissatisfied,--and I told them the truth, if they had had sense\r\nenough to believe me. Mr. Pitt then pressed me to talk it over with\r\nMr. Grenville, which I declined. I said, I would certainly never give\r\nMr. Conway any dishonourable advice; would never try to persuade him\r\nto be bribed or terrified; nor would he forgive me if I should. Pitt\r\npersisted. I said, “Mr. Pitt, I am persuaded Mr. Grenville will never\r\nreport my conversation differently from the truth: but though he may\r\nnot intend it, he may mistake me; I may mistake him. I will wait on\r\nhim, upon condition a third person is present. I do not desire it may\r\nbe a friend of mine, and not his: you are a friend to both; and though\r\njustly much more attached to him than to me, I am persuaded, if any\r\ndifference should arise between us in the relation of the interview,\r\nyou have too much honour not to do strict justice to either. If you may\r\nbe present, I will meet him,--but remember, I tell you it will be to\r\nno purpose.” In truth, after such a Star-Chamber sentence as _the King\r\ncannot trust his army in the hands of a man who votes in Parliament\r\nagainst him_, I was not disposed to labour in cementing an union\r\nbetween my friend and a man of such apostate degeneracy. From that\r\nhour all my prejudices in Grenville’s favour were dispelled. I saw how\r\ndangerous he was: it was Fox with a fairer character.\r\n\r\nThough I had given too little encouragement to expect any alteration\r\neither in Mr. Conway’s or my own sentiments, Grenville persisted in the\r\ninterview. I went accordingly to Mr. Thomas Pitt’s. It happened to be\r\nthe evening of the riot on burning the North Briton. Grenville arrived\r\nin the most ridiculous and extraordinary disorder I ever saw. He could\r\nscarce articulate for passion. One would have thought the City had been\r\ntaken by storm and the guards cut to pieces. Yet this was not a panic.\r\nIt was rage to see authority set at nought while _he_ was minister. His\r\nsubsequent conduct gave evidence that this was his sensation: no man\r\never bore power with more pride. For some time I could scarce learn\r\nwhat had provoked him: the confusion of his ideas made him talk as if\r\nMr. Conway had raised a rebellion. Commanding my laughter, and waiting\r\nwith patience till the torrent should have spent itself, but to no\r\npurpose, I was forced at last to ask what the riot had to do with Mr.\r\nConway’s case? This unfortunate question, like snatching a pebble from\r\namidst a cascade, did but make it dash at random on all sides. From\r\nseven in the evening till ten at night, I sat to hear his inundation of\r\nwords, scarce uttering ten myself; and we parted with as little fruit\r\nas might be expected from a conversation so intemperate and disjointed;\r\nthe result of all I said being to repeat my request that he would have\r\npatience, and assuring him that he would not find Mr. Conway engaged in\r\nany regular opposition.\r\n\r\nWhether it proceeded from his impatience of contradiction, whether\r\nfrom eagerness to carry his point, or whether privately instigated\r\nby the Bedfords to push on an explanation which they hoped might\r\ndrive Mr. Conway into settled hostilities, or whether, which I think\r\nmost likely, they flattered themselves they should regain him from\r\nmy influence, Grenville desired an interview with Conway himself.\r\nHe consulted me, and we agreed that he should act as I had done,\r\nand insist on a third person being present, proposing the Duke of\r\nRichmond,[411] his son-in-law, who however could not be exceptionable,\r\nas he acted uniformly with the Court. This demand produced a new\r\nscene of ridiculous distress. Though the meeting had been proposed,\r\nand Mr. Conway’s answer sent by noon, it was not till ten at night\r\nthat Mr. Grenville could bring himself to any resolution; being, as\r\nhis servant owned, shut up for the greatest part of the time with his\r\nwife,[412] a proud, ambitious, and sensible woman, and the only person\r\nto whom he would listen. She, indeed, had full dominion over him. The\r\nprecautions taken both by Mr. Conway and me had put Grenville on his\r\nguard: not a word dropped from him intimating bribery. The meeting\r\nended fruitlessly, as we had foreseen. Conway was naturally cold, and\r\nGrenville far from being master of ingratiating persuasion. Conway\r\nadhered to the declaration that he was engaged in no opposition. His\r\nsubsequent behaviour amply confirmed that assurance; but a new measure\r\nof obedience was set up, and my late republican friend was become as\r\nstrict a disciplinarian as the most arbitrary of his predecessors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n  Marriage of the Princess Augusta with the Hereditary Duke of\r\n    Brunswick.--His marked opposition to the wishes of the King.--\r\n    Debates on Wilkes’s complaint of Breach of Privilege.--Sir William\r\n    Meredith and Sir George Saville.--The “Essay on Woman.”--The\r\n    Marriage Bill.--Debate on Breach of Privilege.--Cases of Carteret\r\n    Webbe and Wood.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo early as in the late reign there had been thoughts of a double\r\nalliance with the ducal house of Brunswick; but when the jealousy of\r\nthe Princess Dowager had prevented the marriage of her son with a\r\nprincess of that line, there had remained no great propensity in the\r\nCourt of Brunswick to the other match between the hereditary Prince\r\nand Lady Augusta.[413] It had, however, been treated of from time to\r\ntime; and in 1762 had been agreed, but was abruptly broken off by the\r\ninfluence of the King of Prussia. Lady Augusta was lively, and much\r\ninclined to meddle in the private politics of the Court. As none of her\r\nchildren but the King had, or had reason to have, much affection for\r\ntheir mother, she justly apprehended Lady Augusta’s instilling their\r\ndisgusts into the Queen. She could not forbid her daughter’s frequent\r\nvisits at Buckingham House, but to prevent any ill consequence from\r\nthem, often accompanied her thither. This, however, was an attendance\r\nand constraint the Princess of Wales could not support. Her exceeding\r\nindolence, her more excessive love of privacy, and the subjection of\r\nbeing frequently with the Queen, whose higher rank was a never-ceasing\r\nmortification, all concurred to make her resolve at any rate to deliver\r\nherself from her daughter. To attain this end, profusion of favours to\r\nthe hated House of Brunswick was not thought too much. The hereditary\r\nPrince was prevailed on to accept Lady Augusta’s hand, with fourscore\r\nthousand pounds, an annuity of 5000_l._ a year on Ireland, and 3000_l._\r\na year on Hanover. Fourscore thousand pounds were given with the late\r\nPrincess Royal[414] to the Prince of Orange, but she was a King’s\r\ndaughter. The Princess Mary[415] and Louisa had but forty thousand each.\r\n\r\nLady Augusta was not handsome, but tall enough, and not ill-made; with\r\nthe German whiteness of hair and complexion, so remarkable in the Royal\r\nFamily, and with their precipitate, yet thick, Westphalian accent. She\r\nhad little grace or softness in her manner: yet with more attractions\r\nshe might have failed to gain a heart that was not inclined to part\r\nwith its liberty, and least of all to one of her family. The Prince\r\narrived on the 12th of January; and, as if to prejudice him against his\r\nbride, the plan was formed to disgust him as much in order to send him\r\naway as soon as possible. He was lodged at Somerset House: no guards\r\nwere stationed there. The Lord Steward chose the company that should\r\ndine with him: and every art was used to prevent his seeing Mr. Pitt,\r\nor the chiefs of the Opposition. At the wedding, which was on the 16th,\r\nthe servants of the King and Queen were ordered not to appear in new\r\nclothes. But though these little artifices had the desired effect of\r\naffronting the Prince, they only drew mortifications on the Court. The\r\npeople, enchanted with novelty and a hero, were unbounded in their\r\nexultations wherever he appeared; and, as the behaviour of the Court\r\ngot wind, took pleasure, when he attended the King to the theatres, to\r\nmark their joy at the presence of the Prince, and to show the coldest\r\nneglect of their Sovereign. Nor was the Prince less assiduous to\r\nintimate his dissatisfaction, even to ill-breeding, turning his back\r\nto the King, as he stood over against him in the box at the Opera;\r\nand even going away during half the representation. To the Duke of\r\nNewcastle, and others in disgrace, he was full of attentions; dined\r\ntwice with the Duke of Cumberland, and affectedly lingered there,\r\nthough the King and Queen waited for him to a ball: and, as he found\r\n_that_ step would be the most offensive, though indeed due from him\r\nto one so partial to his family, he made a visit to Mr. Pitt, at\r\nHayes.[416] These little hostilities were carried on with such vigour\r\non both sides, that, notwithstanding all his curiosity and desires\r\nexpressed of a longer stay, the King forced him and his bride to\r\ndepart on the 25th--only thirteen days after his arrival. They were\r\novertaken in a great storm at sea, and in extreme danger of being lost;\r\nbut escaped, not only with good fortune to themselves, but to the\r\nCourt of England, who would have appeared as guilty to the people in\r\ndriving them out at such a season, as if they had raised the tempest by\r\nsorcery.[417]\r\n\r\nThe Parliament having reassembled on Jan. 16th, the House of Commons\r\non the 19th proceeded on the affair of Wilkes. He had given out that\r\nhe would return from Paris, and make his defence: and to carry on the\r\ndelusion, a dinner was bespoken, and company invited to meet him;\r\nbut on the day destined for deciding his fate, a letter from him was\r\ndelivered to the Speaker, accompanied by a certificate from two French\r\nsurgeons, attesting his incapacity of travelling from the ill state\r\nof his wound. The Court party objected even to the reading of the\r\ncertificates, but though they could not prevent it, so eager was the\r\ncuriosity of the House, they did frustrate a motion for adjournment\r\nby 239 to 102; on which many of the minority finding their weakness\r\nleft the House. Others battled for the criminal till near four in the\r\nmorning, but their numbers still dwindling away, Wilkes was at last\r\nexpelled with scarce a negative, the warmest sticklers for him having\r\nbeen discountenanced and discouraged by the harsh epithets bestowed on\r\nhim by Pitt in one of the former debates.\r\n\r\nThe next day Sir William Meredith and Sir George Saville moved to\r\nhave Wilkes’s complaint of breach of privilege examined. George\r\nGrenville tried to evade it, but was strongly attacked by Charles\r\nTownshend, and reproached with the dismission of General A’Court, and\r\nwith the arbitrary influence exerted by the Administration. Sir John\r\nGriffin[418] the day before had mentioned too the case of A’Court, and\r\nsaid he himself would not be intimidated by the disgrace of ten more\r\ngenerals. The Court at last yielded the point; and the 26th was fixed\r\nfor hearing the complaint.\r\n\r\nSir William Meredith[419] and Sir George Saville were both men of\r\ncharacter, and both singular in different ways. The first was a convert\r\nfrom Jacobitism; inflexibly serious, and of no clear head: yet\r\npractice formed him to a manner of speaking that had weight, and was\r\nworth attending to by those who had patience for it. He was, I believe,\r\nan honest man, though not without personal views, which a little\r\nsharpened his scorn of those who had unlike views, and were not equally\r\nhonest.\r\n\r\nSir George Saville had a head as acutely argumentative as if it had\r\nbeen made by a German logician for a model. Could ministers have been\r\nfound acting by the advice of casuists and confessors, Sir George would\r\nstill have started distinctions to hamper their consciences; but though\r\nthey walked not in such ruled paths, his want of ambition carried him\r\nso seldom to the House, that they were not often troubled with his\r\nsubtleties. He had a large fortune, and a larger mind; and though his\r\nreason was sharp, his soul was candid, having none of the acrimony or\r\nvengeance of party: thence was he of greater credit than service to\r\nthat in which he listed.[420]\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd these two Baronets moved to put off the affair of Wilkes’s\r\ncomplaint of breach of privilege to the 13th of February, as the\r\nmaterial evidence, Wilkes’s servant, was in France with him. Sir\r\nGeorge particularly attacked Grenville with much spirit. Grenville, as\r\nusual, spoke too long, though not ill, insinuating that this delay was\r\ncalculated to keep up the flame. “He had always,” he said, “been averse\r\nto having this matter discussed, which had better never be decided; and\r\nthat he had only given way in order to vindicate Lord Halifax and Lord\r\nEgremont.” It was perhaps true, that in some cases it were better that\r\ncertain powers should not be defined. It might be of use that traitors\r\nshould think Ministers have power of committing by General Warrants\r\neven members of Parliament; and at the same time Ministers ought not\r\nto have that power absolutely bestowed on them. But when once the case\r\nhas happened, and that dormant or supposed power has been abused, it\r\nmust be inquired into and regulated; or acquiescence constitutes the\r\nsecond evil hinted at above. But in any case Grenville’s argument was\r\nfaulty, for if it was desirable for the public that the case should not\r\nbe defined, the private vindication of two men ought not to supersede\r\nthat utility. However, though the minority on putting the question\r\nwere not loud for it, the ministry gave it up. Sir George Saville took\r\noccasion to make it observed, that so bad was his opinion of Wilkes,\r\nhe had taken no part till, the man being expelled, nothing but the\r\ncause of the House in point of privilege seemed to remain. This did\r\nhonour to Sir George, but prejudiced Wilkes and the cause of liberty.\r\nThe former’s character, as I have said, was very fair: and indeed\r\nmost of the Opposition were unexceptionable in that light. Yet Wilkes\r\nhad, early in his warfare on the Court, told Rigby that he liked the\r\nministers better than their opponents (no great compliment to the\r\nfirst), and desired him to apply to Fox to make him (Wilkes) governor\r\nof Canada--a proposal Fox rejected. It was not to be wondered at that\r\nWilkes, so libertine and jovial, should not be captivated with the\r\ncompany of a set of young men who were as free from the spirit and\r\nvivacity as from the vices of their age. The chiefs were of eminent\r\nrank, and besides losing the power they thought affected to their\r\nbirth, had been wantonly insulted by the Court. But wanting parts to\r\npreserve their power, they equally wanted them to recover it. Yet was\r\nthe Court itself alarmed at a club into which the Opposition formed\r\nthemselves, holding their weekly meetings at a tavern erected on the\r\noccasion by one Wildman, in Albemarle Street[421]--a circumstance I\r\nmention rather as an antiquary than historian; several pamphlets being\r\npublished at this time addressed to, or written in the name of, that\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th, Dowdeswell proposed a Committee of the whole House, to\r\nconsider the Cider Bill. Grenville opposed that motion, agreeing only\r\nto have a Committee to examine the grievances occasioned by it, and\r\nto suggest corrections, but not with power to repeal the bill. These\r\nrestrictions were carried by 167 to 125.[422]\r\n\r\nThe same day the House of Lords sat on the _Essay on Woman_. Lord\r\nSandwich moved to vote Wilkes the author of it, and to order him to\r\nbe taken into custody. The Duke of Devonshire, and even the Duke of\r\nRichmond, though a courtier, spoke against this summary proceeding;\r\nand warm words passed between Lord Temple and Lord Marchmont, the\r\nlatter of whom said, that though Wilkes was gone, he had left his gang\r\nbehind him. At last both questions were formed into this one,--that\r\nit appearing to the House that Wilkes was the author, he should be\r\ntaken into custody: but as he had withdrawn himself, a Committee was\r\nappointed to search for precedents how to proceed.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th, Sir John Glynn in a very thin House moved to re-consider\r\nthe Marriage Act; and a Committee was appointed. Sir John Philipps,\r\ntoo, proposed to re-appoint the Committee of the last year for\r\ninspecting the public accounts, and it was carried by 90 to 30 odd.\r\nLord Holland and the Duke of Newcastle had concurred to bring that\r\ninquiry to nothing, contriving to have the time wasted on the accounts\r\nof the ordnance.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st Dowdeswell moved a question against excise, though without\r\nnaming it, in the Committee on the Cider Bill, but it was thrown out\r\nby 172 to 152, seven of the minority being shut out when the question\r\nwas putting: so near was the Court run by the minority, though without\r\nleaders, and frequently obstructed and distressed by the fluctuation\r\nof the family of Yorke, and the duplicity of Charles Townshend, who\r\noftener spoke against than for them, and _that_ generally when he had\r\ngiven the most solemn assurances of his support.\r\n\r\nOn Feb. 3rd, late in the day, Sir William Meredith moved for the\r\nevidence on which the Secretaries of State had granted the warrant\r\nagainst Wilkes. The Ministry complained of the lateness of the hour,\r\nand Rigby moved to adjourn. Charles Townshend attacked Grenville on it,\r\nand was even seconded by his brother, the General; but the adjournment\r\nwas carried by 73 to 60.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th there was a good debate[423] on Wilkes’s complaint of breach\r\nof privilege, when Sir W. Meredith and Sir George Saville defended\r\nthemselves against the imputation of want of candour, in having made\r\ntheir motion late in a thin House; the former proving that many violent\r\nquestions had been proposed seven hours later than theirs had been. He\r\nmoved for the warrant on which Wilkes had been apprehended, and for\r\nthe information on which it had been grounded. To avoid the demand,\r\nSir John Philipps moved the previous question, declaring that he meant\r\nto discharge the complaint. Lord Strange was at first for having the\r\nwarrant produced; but soon retracted, and said the complaint ought to\r\nbe discharged, as the suit was depending at common law--an argument\r\nthat had been pressed on the Ministers when Wilkes’s expulsion was\r\nagitated, and which they then had refused to admit.\r\n\r\nI have more than once, in the former part of these Memoirs, touched\r\non the character of Lord Strange, as a man acting on notions of his\r\nown, unwedded to any faction, and above temptations of money. He had,\r\nhowever, been gained by Fox to the Court, in the present reign, by the\r\noffer of the post of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the county\r\nwhere his estate and interest lay. The large number of places in the\r\ndisposal of that officer, could gratify his passion for sway in his own\r\nprovince; so true was the maxim of Sir Robert Walpole, that _every man\r\nhas his price_; and so judiciously was this office held out to Lord\r\nStrange; for though he accepted the post on the views I have mentioned,\r\nhe nobly refused to take the annexed salary of 1200_l._ a year. He\r\nseldom afterwards differed with the successive administrations, but\r\nrarely attended Parliament.\r\n\r\nSir William Meredith consented to waive his demand of the information,\r\nthough Beckford protested that he himself had never, as a justice of\r\npeace, granted a warrant without information on oath. Norton pleaded,\r\nthat to grant it would instruct the accuser, Wilkes, in the defence\r\nof the accused Secretaries and Under-Secretaries of State; but T.\r\nTownshend urged that it had already appeared in the Court of Common\r\nPleas, and in the ordinary newspapers. George Grenville[424] said\r\nthat producing the warrant would engage the House to pronounce on\r\nthe legality or illegality of it. Would the House declare that any\r\npapers might be seized? Would it declare that none might? Sir Anthony\r\nAbdy,[425] a lawyer attached to the Duke of Devonshire, said, a sight\r\nof the warrant was demanded as much for the excuse of such members\r\nof the House as had been concerned in it, as for blame; and General\r\nConway added, that if the information was the defence of Wood and the\r\nothers, how would it hurt them? But, said he, this matter is treated\r\nas too high for our inspection. I thought I lived in a free country.\r\nWe have already chosen to give up our own privilege, and now are\r\nafraid to inquire on what grounds it is taken from us.[426] Nugent,\r\nMorton, Elliot, Wilbraham, Dr. Hay, Wood himself, Lord Frederick\r\nCampbell, Forester, Oswald,[427] Ellis, Lord North, and Sir John Glynn,\r\ndebated the question for the Court, besides those I have mentioned;\r\non the other side, Hewet,[428] King’s Sergeant, Mawbey, Lord George\r\nSackville, Dowdeswell, Fitzherbert, Dempster, Charles Townshend, and\r\nOnslow; but the previous question was carried by 217 to 122.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Cider Bill was compromised, and two shillings imposed\r\ninstead of five.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th, the day appointed for considering the Marriage Bill,\r\nCharles Yorke opposed going into Committee, and said Sir John Glynn\r\nshould have stated objections, and proposed amendments; wished to have\r\na bill brought in for that purpose. He talked of the wisdom and temper\r\nwith which it had been carried through before: the truth of which may\r\nbe seen in my former account of that bill. Rigby was for going into the\r\nCommittee, his patron the Duke of Bedford having been, and continuing\r\nto be, its warm adversary. Lord Strange ridiculed ecclesiastical law,\r\nand frankly spoke of marriage as only legal cohabitation. George\r\nGrenville stayed away, and Lord Holland’s friends were for repealing\r\nthe bill. The Opposition, to court the Yorkes, were against altering\r\nit; but it was carried by 157 to 79, for a Committee to re-examine it.\r\nIt was then proposed to go into the Committee on that day sevennight:\r\nCharles Yorke and General Townshend for the Monday sevennight after.\r\nCharles Townshend, who had shone so brightly against the original bill,\r\nkept away; but it was carried for the Wednesday, by 70 to 39.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th, the House of Commons entered seriously on the great\r\nquestion of breach of privilege on Wilkes’s complaint, and the first\r\nday sat till midnight, four hundred and fifty members being present.\r\nSir William Meredith opened the debate with calling for the three\r\nmessengers who had executed the warrant, and for Matthew Brown,\r\nWilkes’s servant, who gave an account of what had passed when his\r\nmaster was seized. I shall not recapitulate these examinations, which\r\nmay be found in the journals of the House; nor what was said by other\r\nwitnesses. Their depositions lasted till nine at night. Philip Carteret\r\nWebbe then made his defence; and it was so scurvy, that he was reduced\r\nto plead inadvertence, and his being a servant of the Secretary\r\nof State. He even had the front to affirm, that there had been no\r\nintention of making Wilkes _close_ prisoner. He then offered to produce\r\nhis evidence, but, it being late, G. Grenville asked if they would\r\nproceed or not? Mr. Pitt said he thought they ought not to stop till\r\nthey knew whether they still had a Constitution or not? Lord Frederick\r\nCampbell, supported by Rose Fuller and General Townshend, moved to\r\nadjourn. Thomas Townshend the younger urged that the House had voted\r\nthe expulsion of a member at four o’clock in the morning--would not\r\nthey proceed to hear his complaint at eleven at night? Mr. Pitt said it\r\nwas derogatory from the honour of the House to adjourn. His own first\r\nwish had been to crush foreign enemies; now it was to crush domestic.\r\nWhen that was done he should die willingly. The question was then\r\nput, but the Ministers not caring to hazard their majority, when the\r\nHouse seemed inclined to proceed, few of their party went out in the\r\ndivision; and thence it was carried by 379 to 31, to go on.\r\n\r\nThe record of the writ of Habeas Corpus, and the returns to it, were\r\nthen read; but so many of the members had retired after the division,\r\nto eating-houses and coffee-houses to refresh themselves, that the\r\nMinisters objected that evidence was not fairly heard on their side;\r\nand Sir James Lowther moving to adjourn, it was carried without a\r\ndivision a quarter before twelve.\r\n\r\nThe next day was spent in hearing precedents of general warrants, in\r\nwhich there appeared but too much countenance for the practice, yet\r\nfounded on no law. The greater part had been issued against Jacobites,\r\non the accession of the present Royal Family, when their establishment\r\nwas new, and precarious. The Lord Viscount Townshend,[429] a zealous,\r\nbold, and authoritative Minister, had made free with the practice. It\r\nhad been used even in cases of libels, but always in those of Jacobite\r\ntendency. Many in times of rebellion had been issued by the Duke of\r\nNewcastle, and three by Mr. Pitt himself, but against persons suspected\r\nof treasonable practices. These documents had Carteret Webbe now\r\ncollected: he printed them, too, in his justification. But the case\r\nof Wilkes was not only dissimilar, but was important enough to call\r\nfor redress of a power so obnoxious and liable to abuse. At one in the\r\nmorning Sir William Meredith commenced the debate, and to what I have\r\nsaid added the history of those warrants. Fifty persons, he owned, had\r\nbeen taken up on such warrants; and then Wilkes on a like indefinite\r\nwarrant. His very pocket-book had been seized to find evidence against\r\nhim. The gentlemen who apprehended him were mere ministerial officers.\r\nThe first warrant quoted was of 1662, for then was passed the first act\r\nfor licensing the press: and as that act was temporary, and has not\r\nbeen revived, it is a proof that there is no law since to authorize\r\nsuch restraint. The warrants themselves have been found by the Court\r\nof Common Pleas to be illegal. He then read the two resolutions he\r\nproposed to move; the first, that _a general warrant for seizing\r\nauthors and papers is not law_. The second, that _seizing Members of\r\nParliament by general warrant is contrary to privilege_. Breach of\r\nprivilege, he added, might be committed _in the manner_, even where\r\nthere is no privilege. These warrants had never been used but in times\r\nof danger, and then were followed by Acts of Indemnity, and thence\r\nnever came to be questioned. They were suspended from 1675 to 1690, and\r\nthen were resumed to protect the Revolution. Again in 1715 and 1745,\r\nthe years of the Scottish rebellions. They were now used for such a\r\ntrifle as a libel, that was in every man’s hand. The licentiousness of\r\nthe people had been checked: it was time now to quiet their minds by\r\nchecking the licentiousness of power.\r\n\r\nLord Frederick Campbell, with much warmth, called on the House to\r\nvindicate Wood and Webbe, their accused members. Wood said he had done\r\nhis duty, and hoped to be restored to the precise situation in which\r\nhe had stood before the accusation. Sir W. Meredith said, Lord Chief\r\nJustice Keeling being accused, pleaded he had acted by precedent.\r\nThe practice was censured before the person, as it is necessary to\r\nascertain the crime ere the criminal can be condemned. Charles Yorke\r\nsaid he hoped to hear Keeling’s case read another day; and then moved\r\nto adjourn. Norton said he was willing to have the general case\r\nadjourned, but not the particular one of the accused. The debate took\r\nthat turn of postponing the case of the warrants, but the Ministers\r\ninsisted on disculpating the accused, Grenville particularly declaring\r\nfor discharging the complaint of breach of privilege. Pitt replied,\r\nthat if the second question should pass, it would be impossible\r\nentirely to acquit the accused. They could not be acquitted or\r\ncondemned till the general question should be affirmed or condemned.\r\nIf the warrant should be declared illegal, he would extenuate their\r\nbehaviour as having acted by precedent. To this Wood, with much heat\r\nand arrogance replied, that he would not accept of being _excused_.\r\n\r\nWood,[430] originally a travelling tutor and excellent classic scholar,\r\nis well known from those beautiful and simple Essays prefixed to the\r\neditions of the _Ruins of Balbec and Palmyra_;[431] whither he had\r\ntravelled with two[432] young gentlemen of fortune and curiosity. His\r\ntaste and ingenuity had recommended him to Mr. Pitt for his private\r\nsecretary when Minister; but the observance required by Pitt, and the\r\npride, though dormant, of Wood, had been far from cementing their\r\nconnection. Wood had then attached himself to the Duke of Bridgwater,\r\nand through him to the Bedford faction; but remaining in office\r\nwhen Mr. Pitt quitted, had, with too much readiness, complied with\r\nthe orders of his new masters. His general behaviour was decent, as\r\nbecame his dependent situation; but his nature was hot, and veering to\r\ndespotic.\r\n\r\nLord George Sackville told him that intentionally he had done right,\r\nbut was not ready to say that he had done legally right. Lord Strange\r\nsaid he would not consent to postpone the acquittal of the accused.\r\nGeneral Townshend desired to have the debate adjourned to Friday 17th,\r\nbeing obliged to give attendance on his father, who was dying. His\r\nbrother Charles, more decently than the rest, said the questions were\r\nthe same, and required the same discussion: he would not consent to\r\ndivide them. In truth, there could be no thought of separating them but\r\nin compliment to Wood, for few could have any partiality for Webbe. Sir\r\nWilliam Meredith and Sir George Saville, both candid men, had wished\r\nto avoid naming persons,--a respect detrimental in great national\r\nquestions; for not only the multitude will more easily be led by names\r\nthan by speculation and theory, but what Ministers will fear to offend,\r\nif censure only touches their practice, not their persons? It is to the\r\nhonour of the persons who composed that Opposition that their delicacy\r\nfrequently, nay, constantly, hurt their cause. Yet should that delicacy\r\nnot be imitated. When the freedom of a nation is at stake, what chance\r\nhas liberty, if opponents have scruples for Ministers who have none?\r\n\r\nCharles Yorke and Dowdeswell then moved to adjourn till Friday; and\r\nGeneral Conway observed justly, that if the accused were acquitted\r\nfirst, the general question would not be left entire; for could the\r\nHouse vote that general warrants were illegal, after it should have\r\nvoted that they who executed those warrants were blameless? Yet\r\nWood continued loudly to demand his justification. Mr. Pitt was for\r\nadjourning the whole debate; and said, if this was not agreed to,\r\nhe would debate the whole. Sir George Saville said, Wood was guilty\r\nof impatience, though an honest one; and complained that he and Sir\r\nWilliam Meredith were not suffered to prove their whole charge.\r\n\r\nAt half an hour after four in the morning the House divided, the\r\nOpposition being for adjourning the whole matter; and to the great\r\ndismay of the courtiers, the Ministerial party were but 207, and the\r\nopponents 197--a triumph in parliamentary cases little preferable to\r\na defeat; so strong had been the alarm on seizing the papers, and so\r\nevident was it that the Ministerial majority had been the work of\r\nvenality against conviction.\r\n\r\nDr. Hay then moved to discharge the complaint; but Pitt, roused\r\nby this swell of his party, and feeling the weight of so large a\r\nminority, poured forth one of his finest rhapsodies on liberty, though\r\nat that late hour, and after the fatigue of so long an attendance\r\nand attention: and he severely reprimanded Wood’s insolence, telling\r\nhim that, if he would not accept excuse, he deserved censure.\r\nGrenville asked why these persons were blamed, and not all their\r\npredecessors?[433] Pitt, still rising in fire and importance, took the\r\nwhole debate on himself, asking what he had done, but in a war which he\r\nwas called upon to invigorate? He had never turned out officers; he had\r\nsought for merit in those who _now_ held precarious commissions, not by\r\nmilitary service. They had not only saved their country, but him who\r\nhad been undone if they had not saved their country.\r\n\r\nGrenville, not losing courage on this turn of fortune, replied ably\r\nand finely. He knew, he said, the nation was left on the brink of\r\nruin.[434] The Ministers had had enough to do without hunting in alleys\r\nfor libels. He then painted faction, first setting England against\r\nScotland; then reviving party names, and drawing the line between the\r\nParliament and people. Look! said he, look at Wilkes’s letters, where\r\nhe talks of _rare combustibles_!\r\n\r\n_Colonel_[435] Barré, rising to speak, and being pointed to by the\r\nSpeaker under that military appellation, thanked him, but said he had\r\nno right to that title; yet it gave him occasion to ask why he had\r\nbeen dismissed? what had his Majesty done on his accession? He looked\r\nout if any man had been whispered out of the service, and did him\r\nample justice. (This alluded to Sir Henry Erskine, dismissed in the\r\nlate reign, and restored to his rank by the present King; a speaking\r\ninstance against the change of measures since adopted.) Himself, he\r\nsaid, was of no consequence, but let Ministers take care how they\r\ndeprived the Crown of other faithful servants at the end of a glorious\r\nwar. Non de vectigalibus agitur, sed de animâ nostra res agitur.\r\nPrecedents did not justify: Charles the First had acted on precedents.\r\n\r\nOnslow congratulated Grenville ironically on having never given one\r\nvote for the last ruinous war, which he now so much condemned. And\r\nthey, said he, who are for acquitting these gentlemen, ought to\r\nremember who insisted on having their two names inserted, when Sir\r\nGeorge Saville and Sir W. Meredith would have omitted them. In fact,\r\nthe Ministers had got the names inserted with the view of having them\r\ncleared by a vote of the House.\r\n\r\nMawbey then moved to adjourn, which was overruled by 208 to 184, and\r\nthen the complaint being discharged, the House rose at half an hour\r\nafter seven in the morning, the longest sitting on record, exceeding\r\nthat on the Westminster Election, in 1742, and the last sitting on\r\nthe Militia Bill, in 17--; but this latter was less a debate than the\r\nperseverance of a very few persons who sat till six in the morning to\r\nperfect that bill.\r\n\r\nThe Court was strangely alarmed at this sudden rise of the Opposition,\r\nand set them roundly to oppose its progress, well knowing that when\r\nonce the scale turns, it is difficult to secure even the venal, who\r\nhurry over to the side to which fortune seems inclining. Nor was much\r\ntime given them to rally their forces, the great question coming on\r\nwithin four days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n  Debates on the legality of General Warrants, and the conduct of\r\n    Wilkes, continued.--Treatise entitled “Droit le Roi,” condemned by\r\n    the Lords.--Wilkes found guilty of being the Author of “The North\r\n    Briton” and the “Essay on Woman.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFeb. 17th the House went into the debate on the subject, _that a\r\ngeneral warrant for seizing the author, printer, &c., of a seditious\r\nlibel, is not legal_. Dr. Hay said it was evident this had been the\r\npractice, nor had the Courts below condemned it. He should, therefore,\r\npropose an amendment, that the question might be stated clearly and\r\nprecisely. If that correction was agreed to, he intended to offer\r\nothers that should condemn the whole practice of the secretary’s\r\noffice. He then moved to add the word _treasonable_ after _seditious_;\r\nand then he would propose, he said, to subjoin the following sentence,\r\n_though such warrant hath been according to the practice of office, and\r\nhas not been condemned by any courts of justice in which such warrants\r\nhave been produced_. He was seconded by Wedderburne, who argued against\r\ntaking up one particular warrant, half excusing that in question by\r\nsaying, he would not affirm that practice makes law. Pitt ridiculed the\r\nDoctor and the Ministry for trying to perplex the question; but owning\r\nhandsomely that he should like the question better if spread over the\r\nwhole practice, and not confined to the single instance before them.\r\nIf his own practice had been faulty, he was willing to bear his share\r\nof public blame. He called on the Ministers to show what was really\r\nthe subject matter of the question: was it on _seditious_ libels? then\r\ndo not cut and shuffle with our liberties by an epithet. We had seen\r\nthe day when an epithet would defeat Magna Charta. Any other epithet\r\nof four syllables would throw dust in the eyes of members, as well as\r\n_treasonable_. But now, said he, they parry and _twist_, and I like it\r\nthe better. I am glad that all the learned doctor’s abilities could\r\nproduce was an epithet. But keep separate things separate in their\r\nnature. Vote the general question on _seditions_ first. We never desire\r\nto alter the practice in cases of high treason. The learned gentleman,\r\nhe supposed, would allow that there might be seditious libels without\r\ntreason in them. It was shallow, the artifice of attempting to draw\r\nin gentlemen to condemn seditious warrants by coupling the word\r\n_treasonable_ to them, which aggravates the offence; but by not daring\r\nto let the question stand simply on its own merits, on the case of a\r\ngeneral warrant issued against a seditious libel, not a treasonable\r\none, they tacitly avowed that the libel not being treasonable, their\r\nown conduct had been illegal. But no general warrant to search\r\nuniversally without specification of name or place, was allowable, even\r\nin case of treason. _General warrants are always wrong_; yet if this\r\namendment left the House at liberty to debate on the whole question,\r\nand not on that amendment solely, he would not be against the stating\r\nthose words. Hay was hurt, and said he had nowhere been accustomed to\r\nthe manœuvre of quibbles: he had only affirmed that general warrants\r\nhad been produced in other courts: he had not said that those courts\r\nhad decided on them. Conway pursued Pitt’s argument, and showed how\r\ntotally the original question and the proposed alteration of it\r\ndiffered; that if anything could authorize a general warrant, it was\r\ntreason. By inserting that word, the Ministers betrayed the badness\r\nof their own cause; he feared they were a little tender; that they\r\ncould not bear the last division. He honoured the lights of the law,\r\nbut feared the House had a little too much of them: yet could those\r\nlearned men prove that treason and sedition were the same? Why was it\r\nnecessary, too, to describe historically what had been the custom? The\r\ncase was clear and simple, when a gentleman came and slipped in a word\r\nthat totally varied the argument: it was _white_, he inserts the word\r\n_black_; and thus would vote that the Ministers had not done wrong\r\nby taking up a man for a crime of which he had not been guilty. If a\r\ngeneral warrant is good against treason, and not against sedition, and\r\nyet you couple them, and make them one crime, are Ministers blameless\r\nfor inflicting on sedition the punishment only due to treason? Separate\r\nthe questions, and vote, if you can, that the warrant was legal.\r\n\r\nHussey[436] said he liked the amendment, because he disliked all\r\ngeneral warrants; for what was to follow, he did not understand it. Did\r\nit mean to imply that the silence of the King’s Bench was affirmation?\r\nHe feared some such thing was meant; but it would be a libel on the\r\nJudges that sit there. He did not, however, he said, mean to extend\r\nhis argument to high treason. He wished to have general warrants\r\ncondemned, because to some there stood the names of men of virtue,\r\nwhich seemed to authorize so bad a practice. Wedderburne said sharply,\r\nthat he had guarded himself by alleging that the practice of the King’s\r\nBench could not make law: but they had been taunted with epithets; the\r\ntime was come when men would no longer be led by epithets[437] and\r\nflowery declamation. It was hurting our country to study popularity\r\nby vilifying the profession of the law. Was a definition nothing but\r\nepithets? The Opposition, he knew, would be glad, if they could, to\r\nstand clear of epithets. Charles Yorke was for adopting the amendments,\r\nand spoke for temper. _Treasonable_ corresponded with the evidence\r\ngiven at the bar. The common warrants had that description in them.\r\nHe was for stating what had been the common usage, and then for\r\ncondemning it. None of those warrants had come before the Courts below\r\nfor argument or consideration. Sir William Meredith said, he hoped\r\nthis point would be decided by the spirit of liberty, not by law;\r\nand with some heat added, “I never passed my life with the vices of\r\nWilkes.” This sentence, provoked by what had fallen from Wedderburne,\r\nand supposed to be aimed, as it justly might have been, at Dr. Hay,\r\nwho, though so servile now, had been the intimate of Wilkes,[438] was\r\nlevelled at Lord Sandwich. But Wedderburne took it up, and said, if\r\nSir William had meant anything unparliamentary, he might have taken\r\nanother place. Dr. Hay, thinking it necessary to vindicate himself, did\r\nnot conciliate more favour. He had long, he said, known the unhappy\r\nman, had received pleasure and instruction from him, but with many good\r\nqualities he had grown profligate; did not know who incited him; had\r\nadvised him against his excesses; “Yet,” said he, “I am no hypocrite;\r\nI have told him he was grown the _God_ of defamation from keeping\r\nseditious company; he had even attacked the Crown, and the _parent_\r\nof the Crown; for himself, he pitied the poor _devil_.” Some persons\r\ninterposing to prevent a duel, Sir W. Meredith said, he had every day\r\nbeen aspersed as taking up this matter for the sake of Wilkes. This he\r\ncould not bear. Wedderburne had taken it up on tip-toe, though neither\r\npointed at him nor Dr. Hay. Himself would last year have stopped\r\nWilkes’s behaviour.\r\n\r\nHussey then proposed to insert the words _in the King’s Bench, where\r\nthe warrants had never been condemned or approved, whereas they had\r\nbeen condemned in the Court of Common Pleas_. To this Norton agreed,\r\nthough he said he would show that they had been approved in the King’s\r\nBench. Prisoners are brought thither by Habeas Corpus, and the court is\r\ncounsel for the prisoner. They examine the legality of the commitment,\r\nand must remit him, or bail him, or remand him. Remanding him, or\r\nrequiring bail, is approving the commitment. Pitt proposed to add, “in\r\nwhich court (the King’s Bench) it does not appear that the validity of\r\ngeneral warrants has been brought in question.” Charles Yorke said he\r\nagreed with Pitt, but would have the sentence run thus, “although hath\r\nbeen frequently produced to, and never been questioned by, the King’s\r\nBench.” Sir William said he could not agree to the amendment, for the\r\nHouse had only heard evidence ex-parte for exculpation of the accused\r\nMinisters. Pitt objecting strongly to the words _never questioned_,\r\nCharles Yorke offered these, “and the validity never debated.” Forester\r\napproved this, and asked if the point had never been litigated, why\r\nshould those words be inserted? George Grenville protested that nothing\r\nshould make him say that _all_ those warrants were legal; but with\r\nNorton he desired to add, “though the parties have been remanded and\r\nbailed.” Pitt, offended that the opinion of some Judges had been quoted\r\nin defence of the warrant, said, he was no judge, but sat there to\r\njudge Judges. There had not been a violation of the Constitution but\r\nhad been sanctified by the greatest Judges. Let Norton turn to evidence\r\nand prove such prisoners had been remanded. If discharged, let the\r\nHouse have that evidence also. Conway treated the whole amendment as\r\ntrifling; and asked if they would take no notice of the decision of\r\nthe Common Pleas against the legality of the warrant, and yet would\r\ntake notice of a _no_ decision? He wished to have the whole referred to\r\na Committee. Charles Yorke affirmed that none had been remanded; but\r\nagreed with Norton that they had been bailed. Charles Townshend asked,\r\nsince the lawyers allowed that bail might be given on an erroneous\r\nwarrant, why they would _mention it_? Norton owned that he meant from\r\nthence to argue for the legality. The amendments were agreed to.\r\n\r\nThe Court having carried this point, Norton impudently confessed this\r\nwas what he had aimed at; and as there were so many causes connected\r\nwith this depending in the Courts below, he should move to put off\r\nthe question for four months. The Ministers did not doubt but the\r\nlegality of the warrants would be condemned in Westminster Hall; yet\r\na previous censure in Parliament might not only ensure that decision,\r\nbut produce arraignment of the Administration. They feared, from what\r\nhad passed in the foregoing day, that they should never be able to\r\ncarry an approbation of the warrants,--and if they could, into what\r\nconfusion must the nation have fallen, if such warrants were upheld\r\nby Parliament, and anathematized in the other courts? Their plan,\r\ntherefore, was to jockey: and the Opposition had fallen into the snare.\r\nIt had been proposed that Lord Granby should move the adjournment; he\r\nrefused, and yet spoke for it,--and was immediately rewarded with the\r\nLieutenancy of Derbyshire, which the Duke of Devonshire had resigned,\r\nand wished, from the rivalship between their families in that county,\r\nto see in any other hands.\r\n\r\nNorton, continuing to triumph in the arts of attorneyship, asked\r\nto what end the House should decide on the point which was to be\r\ndetermined elsewhere? Let, he said, a Committee be appointed to draw up\r\na bill. The practice of a court does make law. For Secretaries of State\r\nhe demanded more power than for a common justice of peace. The House\r\nsits to make laws, not to expound them. He then dropped this sentence,\r\nso decent, yet so worthy of the mouth it fell from, and so often flung\r\nin his teeth,--_If I was a Judge, I should pay no more regard to this\r\nresolution than to that of a drunken porter_;--a sentence that would\r\nhave made old Onslow[439] thunder forth indignation! Norton then moved\r\nto adjourn the debate for four months, as so many causes were depending\r\non the illegality.\r\n\r\nCharles Yorke made a very long speech against postponing a present\r\ndecision, as against the dignity of the House: and he scrupled not\r\nto pronounce the warrant illegal, which he protested he had never\r\nseen till Wilkes was taken up; nor had any question been asked of\r\nthe Attorney or Solicitor Generals by the Administration. Warrants\r\ndated from the Star Chamber. Himself had always been for taking this\r\nmatter up in Parliament, notwithstanding its pendency below. Previous\r\nquestions, to avoid debates, may be useful during foreign treaties,\r\nbut never in cases of privilege. In questions of this sort the House\r\nought to hold the balance between King and people. It was a question in\r\npoint of law impossible to be denied. Were he a Judge, he should pay\r\nregard to the decision of the House of Commons. The question ought to\r\nbe determined for the sake of the Secretaries of State. He must be for\r\nsome law.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Yorke disculpated himself of not having seen the\r\nwarrant, yet the Ministers protested that after Wilkes was taken up,\r\nYorke had given his opinion that No. 45 was a libel, and had advised\r\nthe commitment of him to the Tower. This was advising a man to knock\r\ndown another, and then pleading that he had not seen the bludgeon. Lord\r\nNorth said, if a law was necessary, a partial resolution was trifling.\r\nBy deferring this, they meant to introduce something much better.\r\n\r\nLord George Sackville said, it would only alarm the nation, to fling\r\nover the question the thin parliamentary veil of adjournment. When\r\ncould a question of liberty be so properly taken up as under such\r\na King? It was the time to lop such an excrescence. Lord North had\r\npromised much, but would perform nothing. The House of Commons singly\r\ncannot make law; but can declare upon it. He thanked God that on this\r\nquestion the whole body of lawyers was not on the side of power: that\r\nbattery would be too much to stand. How came the Secretaries of State\r\nby this practice, but from the Star Chamber and Licensing Act? It had\r\nnever been abused till now, for it had been exercised only against\r\ntraitors. A discretionary power must always be at the peril of the\r\nSecretary that uses it. But he would therefore declare it illegal for\r\na warning to them, and to show the people that they had a watchful\r\nHouse of Commons.\r\n\r\nNugent said, “Liberty rings round the House, and we may all be\r\nunanimously in the wrong.” “We are not likely to be _unanimously_\r\nwrong,” replied Conway, “nor rash, for nothing was ever so fully\r\ndebated. The Ministers had narrowed the question to Wilkes, and\r\nthen called it too narrow. The previous question would in effect be\r\na negative. Wood had called for immediate decision. There had been\r\nissued but one warrant as extensive as this down to the time of Lord\r\nTownshend, and that had been in the reign of Charles the Second. He\r\nthat gives a power of tyranny gives tyranny.” Hussey added, that the\r\nLicensing Act had been dropped because the Peers would not consent to\r\nlet their houses be searched.\r\n\r\nLord Frederick Campbell said that in a fortnight’s time general\r\nwarrants would be determined to be illegal; and then, what Secretary\r\nof State would dare to sign one? Lord Granby, declaring he thought\r\nthem illegal because Lord Chief Justice Pratt had thought so, said, no\r\nSecretary of State after that opinion would venture to issue them.\r\n\r\nCharles Townshend made a most capital speech, replete with argument,\r\nhistory, and law, though severe on the lawyers: a speech, like most\r\nof his, easier to be described than detailed. How great, he said,\r\nmust be the talents of Norton, if the House heard him with patience,\r\nthough comparing them to a _drunken porter_. Whether in the House or\r\nout of the House, Norton, he feared, would be fatal to the cause. He\r\nthen gave the history of the Licensing Act, and read the resolution\r\nof the year 1675, drawn by Mr. Locke, and the report of Lord Chief\r\nJustice Vaughan of usage not constituting law. Had Norton lived in\r\nthe age of ship-money, how he would have argued for putting off the\r\ndecision of its being illegal! But it was become more necessary to\r\nalter this, because of the many precedents in its favour. He then gave\r\na description of the warrant against Wilkes, and how long they had been\r\nbefore they applied it to him. He abhorred Wilkes, he said; and drew a\r\nsevere picture of him, and another panegyrical of the great Whig Lords\r\nat the time of the Revolution, and of those at the accession of the\r\npresent Royal Family. “But it seems,” continued he, “we are not to have\r\na resolution, but a bill. The first time was always the best time; the\r\nnatural mode the best mode. One advantage had been derived from Wilkes,\r\nhe had stopped a growing evil. Nobody could think what thirty years\r\nmore in abler hands would have done. This warrant without description\r\nof person might take up any man under any description of a libel.\r\nIf the House did not come to some resolution, what dissatisfaction\r\nit must create. Mankind would learn that the lawyers were divided\r\nin their sentiments on the legality, and would be clamorous to have\r\nsettled a point so important to the security of their persons, houses,\r\nand papers. But do not be wheedled by promises; who gives promises\r\ngives deceit.” He praised Mr. Pitt, and concluded with saying that\r\nthis warrant was like an experiment in anatomy, which might be tried\r\non a poor man. Wilkes is odious, cry the Ministers; commit him. If\r\nParliament suffers it, you may strike at higher objects.\r\n\r\nAfter several other speeches, Pitt said “this was not a warrant,\r\nbut a delegation of magistracy, which the Crown could not give, and\r\nshould Secretaries of State give it? The debate had been carried on\r\nwithout heat--indeed with too much coldness. Lawyers termed this\r\nwarrant erroneous;--was that term harsh enough? Hear the language of\r\nMinisters and their agents: Carteret Webbe said he had settled Wilkes\r\n_comfortably_ in the Tower with his shaving things! Then, they say,\r\nyou need not pronounce this illegal; Secretaries of State will be\r\nsufficiently frightened; the Judges may or may not declare it illegal;\r\nand you shall have a law. I should be against such a law; it would be\r\naugmenting the power of the Crown by law. What will our constituents\r\nsay if we do not ascertain their liberties? How do you know the Lords\r\nwill agree to the bill? Not doing is doing.”\r\n\r\nHe was answered by Grenville and Sir John Philipps; but Lord Howe,[440]\r\nthough a Lord of the Admiralty, spoke against the adjournment. Elliot\r\nsaid, if there must be a victim, they might have a hecatomb of\r\nMinisters who had signed such warrants. These warrants, it seemed, had\r\nstalked about unknown to Mr. Pitt, who had been Secretary of State, and\r\nto Mr. Yorke, Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nColonel Barré ridiculed Lord Barrington, Elliot, and Grenville,\r\nwith much humour. “Lord Granby thinks,” added he, “that no Secretary\r\nof State will venture on these warrants after Pratt’s opinion; but\r\nGrenville says that opinion was _undue_, erroneous, and precipitate.”\r\nFor himself, he esteemed the professors of the law, but detested the\r\nprofession. Pratt he commended; and said, “shall France deride our\r\nlanguor when her Parliaments are making such strides towards liberty?”\r\n\r\nAt five in the morning the House divided, and the adjournment was\r\ncarried by 232 against 218; a majority of only fourteen. The world\r\nexpected that the Ministers would resign--at least endeavour to\r\ntreat.[441]\r\n\r\nThe offensive behaviour of Norton in the preceding debate, brought\r\nout a story very characteristic of his unfeeling nature. When Dr.\r\nHensey was condemned for treason in the last reign, Lord Mansfield\r\nasked Pratt, the Attorney-General, when he would have him executed?\r\nPratt, struck with compassion, could not bring himself to fix the day.\r\nLord Mansfield then asked Norton, who, turning to the prisoner, said,\r\n“Doctor, when will it be agreeable to you to be executed?”[442]\r\n\r\nWhile mankind expected that the Opposition would vigorously pursue the\r\nadvantage of so large an increase of their numbers, day after day,\r\nand week after week slipped away without their exerting one symptom of\r\nspirit or activity. No motions were made, no inquiries set on foot, no\r\nzeal expressed to keep up the passions and hopes of the party. Without\r\ndoors all hearts were with them, and ready to second their attempts\r\nwith clamour and applause. At first they seemed to expect that the\r\nMinisters would come and lay their places at their feet. The dream\r\nitself was over before an effort was made to realise it. Not a pamphlet\r\nwas written, not a meeting was held, to concert farther measures. A\r\nsupineness unparalleled! but to be accounted for from the composition\r\nof that minority. Pitt affected to be courted to discountenance party,\r\nand to be placed at the head of everything without seeming to desire\r\nit. He despised Newcastle, and resented the manner in which he had been\r\ntreated by that Duke, by Devonshire, by Hardwicke, and the Yorkes.\r\nCharles Yorke was, besides, incompatible with Pitt’s friend, the Chief\r\nJustice Pratt, as the Chancellor’s seal was equally the object of both.\r\nLord Temple, the soul of faction, was detested by the whole party,\r\nexcept by his own small connection. Charles Townshend was attached to\r\nnobody, and trusted by nobody. Legge was industrious, but not spirited:\r\nhe could negotiate for himself, but not for a party. Conway had\r\nsingly meant to arraign the warrants, and had no thought of dipping in\r\nfaction. Some were too fair, and others too dirty, to take the general\r\nsteps that might lead to the good of the whole party: and thus, where\r\nthere was no concert, and in truth but few able men, there could be no\r\nconsequences but inactivity and defeat. That defeat fell heavy on the\r\nmost conscientious, who having offended the Court by their opposition,\r\nwere thus exposed a sacrifice to its resentments.\r\n\r\nNor was this conduct, I doubt, solely founded on inability and\r\noutward disunion. Pitt might expect to be again sent for by Lord\r\nBute, and was unwilling to be clogged with numerous dependents,\r\nodious to the Favourite, and distasteful to himself. He and Lord\r\nTemple had far more rancour against their brother, George Grenville,\r\nthan against Lord Bute; and Pitt, at least, had never been personal\r\nagainst the Favourite, who, with all his resentment to Lord Temple,\r\nas the instigator of Wilkes, had received more recent stabs from\r\nGeorge Grenville. Whether during this suspension of hostilities, any\r\nnegotiation was renewed, I do not pretend to say; nor is it important,\r\nas it certainly had no effect, unless that material one of cooling the\r\ngrowing party.\r\n\r\nThe Ministers, on the other hand, wore a good countenance, and were as\r\nalert as their adversaries were supine and lifeless. To procure votes,\r\nto work underground, to write letters, dispatch messengers, and collect\r\nall possible forces, this was the fort and excellence of Sandwich’s\r\ngenius. He and Rigby were desperate, and Grenville little less so. They\r\nsoon perceived the want of discipline in the enemy’s troops, and the\r\ninsufficiency of their commanders. With some address of their own, and\r\nwith the defect of it in their opponents, they weathered the session,\r\nobtained full power, and showed that they dared to make use of it\r\ndespotically.\r\n\r\nOn the very day of the last great debate in the House of Commons,\r\nLord Lyttelton, seconded by the Duke of Grafton, acquainted the Lords\r\nthat on the following Tuesday he should lay a complaint before them\r\nagainst a new book called _Droit le Roi_. This pestilent treatise was\r\na collection from old statutes and obsolete customs of the darkest and\r\nmost arbitrary ages of whatever tended, or had tended, to show and\r\nuphold the prerogative of the Crown. The fulsome flattery and servility\r\nof ancient lawyers in every reign were amassed together, and shoved\r\nupon the world as the standing law of England; no retrospect had to all\r\nthe immunities obtained since by the Civil War, by the Revolution, and\r\nby various other struggles of Parliaments with the Crown. Such a code\r\nobtruded on the Crown, as a codicil to the stretch of General Warrants,\r\nspoke for itself. It was incense laid on an altar erected to power on\r\nwhich human sacrifices had already been offered. Without metaphor,\r\nsuch a compilation proved that prerogative must have been the object\r\nof the Court before such gross adulation could dare to step forth in\r\nthe face of both Houses of Parliament. The author was one Brecknock,\r\na retainer of the law, and a hackney writer. As no attempt was made\r\nto prove whether he wrote by instigation, it remained problematic.\r\nCertain it is, that he soon afterwards attached himself to the Earl of\r\nNorthumberland.[443]\r\n\r\nOn the 21st, Lord Lyttelton made his complaint, and moved for a censure\r\nof the book as Jacobitical, and violating the Bill of Rights, and the\r\nRevolution. Ministers, he said, ought to have taken notice of it; but\r\nthey who had fallen so severely on seditious pamphlets, had overlooked\r\nthis tract, so subversive of all liberty. Lord Dartmouth treated the\r\nbook with still more severity. Lord Halifax affected to go farther,\r\nbut complained of Lord Lyttelton for not acquainting him with his\r\nintention. Lord Marchmont to the censure proposed to tack a compliment\r\nto the King on his love of liberty; for so servile are some men, that\r\nthey cannot condemn flattery without making use of it.[444] The book,\r\nthus attacked on one side and given up on the other, was sentenced to\r\nbe burnt, and the author ordered to be taken into custody. The latter\r\npart of the sentence nobody took any pains to execute.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th, the Lords communicated their resolutions to the other\r\nHouse, who concurred in the same judgment.\r\n\r\nOn February the 21st, Sir John Philipps, as he had before acquainted\r\nthe House he would, moved for leave to bring in a bill to ascertain\r\nthe power of Secretaries of State in granting warrants--a line almost\r\nimpossible to draw. Treason was to be kept in awe on one side; the\r\nMinisters themselves on the other. Nor could this boon to liberty\r\nbut be suspicious when offered by a hand so rankly Jacobite! The\r\nMinisters had made their use of the idea, and desired no such bill:\r\nand the Opposition were not forward to let them draw such a bill. It\r\nwas therefore dropped with scorn by both sides of the House; and yet\r\nthe Court afterwards affected to talk of this bill as a tender made to\r\nliberty, and rejected by its advocates.\r\n\r\nThe same day was Wilkes found guilty in the King’s Bench, of being\r\nauthor of the North Briton, and of the Essay on Woman.\r\n\r\nThe City of London, to honour the steadiness and services of Mr.\r\nPratt, the other Chief Justice, presented him with the freedom of the\r\nCity, and thanked their own Representatives for their behaviour on the\r\nquestion of the warrants.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of March, it was agreed to amend the Marriage bill by\r\nanother bill, as Mr. Yorke had proposed: and the same day died his\r\nfather, and the father of the Bill, Philip Earl of Hardwicke; a man\r\nwho, during his power, had coloured over very confined parts, and\r\nvery few virtues, with a gravity that was construed into both, as it\r\nserved the purpose of himself or his dependents. Pride, revenge, and\r\navarice were his true features; and whatever pictures shall be drawn\r\nof him where those lines do not predominate, will be unlike, false, and\r\nflattering. To conceal all knowledge of his vast wealth, his sons did\r\nnot prove his will till the memory of him was faded away.[445]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n  The Earl of Egmont.--The Budget.--Taxation of the American\r\n    Colonies.--New Bridge at Blackfriars.--Appearance of the\r\n    “Lettres, Mémoires, et Négotiations du Chevalier d’Eon,” &c.--\r\n    Lord Clive appointed Governor General of India.--Contest at\r\n    Cambridge.--Philip Earl of Hardwicke.--Jeremiah Dyson.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile men were taken up with the politics of the age, there was a\r\nMinister so smitten with the exploded usages of barbarous times,\r\nthat he thought of nothing less than reviving the feudal system.\r\nThis was the Earl of Egmont,[446] who had actually drawn up a plan\r\nfor establishing that absurd kind of government in the island of St.\r\nJohn.[447] He printed several copies of his scheme, and sent them about\r\nto his brother peers. And so little were they masters of the subject,\r\nand so great was the inattention of the Ministry to the outlying parts\r\nof our empire, that his Lordship, in the following year, had prevailed\r\nwith the Council to suffer him to make the experiment, if General\r\nConway had not chanced to arrive at Council and expose the folly of\r\nsuch an undertaking, which occasioned its being laid aside. Lord Egmont\r\nwas such a passionate admirer of those noble tenures and customs,\r\nthat he rebuilt his house at Enmere in Somersetshire in the guise\r\nof a castle, moated it round, and prepared it to defend itself with\r\ncross-bows and arrows, against the time in which the fabric and use of\r\ngunpowder shall be forgotten.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th Mr. Grenville opened the budget, fully, for brevity was\r\nnot his failing; but he did it with art and ability too, though not\r\ndisguising how much he was hurt by abuse. He said it had been written\r\nin pamphlets that 400,000_l._ a year was dealt out in pensions;\r\npretending that the accusation had been levelled against the profusion\r\nof those granted in Ireland, which he denied to be so great as alleged,\r\nparticularly in that bestowed on Lord Sandwich, which, as I have said,\r\nhad been stopped. But in truth the charge had been levelled against\r\nthat sort of corruption in England; and on that he chose to be silent.\r\nMuch art, he said, had been used to dissuade people from subscribing\r\nto the loans of Government; but no new money was to be raised,--no\r\nlottery; the latter to be kept in reserve for another exigence. He\r\nhoped, therefore, people would engage in the funds, as if monied men\r\nwould not keep their cash a year longer, when it must be borrowed! He\r\ntook great merit on the revenue being managed with more frugality than\r\nin the late reign, and on the increase of the customs, particularly in\r\nthe duties on tea, though the increase of trade had much more share\r\nin that rise than his regulations. He stated the debt incurred by the\r\nlate war at sixty-four millions already funded, and nine that were not.\r\nBut above all he praised, and justly, the reduction of the demands\r\nfrom Germany. They amounted to 1,354,803_l._ and upwards, of which\r\n103,355_l._ had only been allowed. 263,211_l._ had been suspended, and\r\n988,237_l._[448] had been struck off. The time had been limited for\r\nthe demands to be brought in, or more would have been asked from that\r\nquarter: and yet our taxes, he said, exceeded by three millions what\r\nthey did in 1754. He then opened his, famous shall I call it, or fatal,\r\nplan for collecting a revenue from America;[449] a plan which, though\r\nit took place in the session I am describing, I will not unfold here;\r\nfor though the regulation was enacted now, the consequences did not\r\nappear to this country till the winter following. I shall be obliged to\r\nsay so much on that head hereafter, that to avoid repetition, and to\r\nintroduce the detail where it will come in with more propriety, and be\r\nmore useful to the reader, I shall pass it over now;--and would to God\r\nthat at the moment I am writing, at the end of 1768, the subject was\r\nnot only fresh, but threatening a scene of long and terrible calamity\r\nboth to England and her colonies! His object, he said, was to make them\r\nmaintain their own army. Till the last war they had never contributed\r\nto their army at all. The extraordinaries of the American war had cost\r\nEngland 36,000_l._ a year. He had, additionally, a plan for preventing\r\nthe colonies from trading directly to France, Holland, Portugal,\r\nor the French islands. Thus did this pedlar in revenue confound\r\nthe tranquillity both of America and Great Britain; and to realize\r\nfarthings, set both countries at variance, at the risk of treasure,\r\nhuman lives, liberty, and common and mutual preservation.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th, at the East India House, which had been a theatre of\r\ndisputes and clashing interests, Mr. Amyand,[450] having quarrelled\r\nwith Sullivan, the leader of the faction opposite to Lord Clive,\r\nsuddenly proposed to give the government of Bengal, with full powers\r\nover their affairs, to that Lord, if he would undertake the commission.\r\nLord Clive, then present, said, this motion was totally unexpected; yet\r\nwould he accept the offer, if a board of directors on whom he could\r\ndepend should be chosen. The election was then at hand. The train\r\ncaught so rapidly, that it was proposed directly to invest him with his\r\njaguire, which had been voted as precipitately too, if somebody[451]\r\nhad not observed that a lawsuit being commenced on that subject, the\r\nlaw must decide it.\r\n\r\nThe City of London applied to Parliament for more money for their new\r\nbridge at Blackfriars. James Grenville objected to it. Dr. Hay broke\r\nout and abused the Common Council, whose late behaviour, he said,\r\nentitled them to no favour. He alluded to their thanking their members\r\nfor voting against general warrants. This produced as warm language in\r\nreturn from Beckford and Onslow. George Grenville interposed, and said,\r\nthe question was not whether the City deserved money, but whether it\r\ncould be afforded. That their temporary bridge having been burnt by\r\naccident, they ought to have a gift of six or seven thousand pounds.\r\nSir William Baker[452] in disdain moved to adjourn, that they might not\r\naccept it.\r\n\r\nThe printers of the London Evening Post and Gazetteer were called\r\nbefore the House of Lords, on a complaint made by the Earl of\r\nMarchmont, for printing a letter (written by Wilkes) reflecting on the\r\nEarl of Hertford, ambassador at Paris, for employing David Hume the\r\nhistorian as his secretary, and representing the embassy as totally of\r\nScotch complexion. Wilkes, then an outlaw, and in France, had gone to\r\nthe Earl’s chapel, who treated him civilly, but neither returned his\r\nvisits nor invited him to dinner, which it was impossible he should\r\ndo, representing the person of the King so grievously outraged by\r\nthat libeller. Lord Marchmont proposed to inflict a fine of 100_l._\r\non each printer. Lord Weymouth said fifty were sufficient; not more\r\nhad been imposed on a printer of a spurious speech for the King. Lord\r\nTemple put them in mind how much himself and the Duke of Cumberland\r\nhad been abused; and in answer to the Duke of Bedford, who had\r\ncomplained that names were now printed at length, said, that practice\r\nhad been begun when himself and Mr. Pitt had resigned the last time.\r\nThe Duke of Richmond said, he remembered that the period in which the\r\nDuke of Cumberland had been most traduced, was in the year 1757. Lord\r\nTemple and Mr. Pitt were then in power. The truth was, no side had\r\nabstained from invectives when out of place. The difference was, that\r\nno attempt was made to punish the authors and printers but under the\r\nadministration of Grenville, Lord Sandwich, and that set.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of March appeared one of the most extraordinary books\r\never published, and though written by a foreigner, and in French, by\r\nno means inferior in detraction to the North Britons. It was a large\r\nquarto, called _Lettres, Mémoires, et Négotiations particulières du\r\nChevalier d’Eon_, &c.: and contained the history of his employments,\r\ntroubles, quarrel with Monsieur de Guerchy, and his own wonderfully\r\nimprudent and insolent letters to the Duc de Praslin, the second\r\nMinister in power at the Court at Versailles. The contempt expressed\r\nfor the Comte de Guerchy was transcendant; but yet this was not the\r\nmost reprehensible part of the work. With the most indefensible\r\nwantonness, D’Eon had inserted the childishly fond, but friendly\r\nletters, of his patron the Duc de Nivernois. With still greater\r\nindiscretion, he published others of an intimate friend employed in\r\nthe office of the Secretary of State at Versailles, in which that\r\nfriend, in confidence, had familiarly censured his masters: and with\r\nthe most abominable treachery D’Eon added confidential letters between\r\nthe Ducs de Nivernois and Praslin, in which, though with goodwill\r\ntowards _him_, they spoke of their intimate friend Monsieur de Guerchy\r\nwith much contemptuous pity, which might be excused between such\r\nnear friends, though never to be pardoned by Guerchy. These letters\r\nD’Eon, when trusted with the Duc de Nivernois’s keys, had stolen or\r\ncopied. To such lengths blind, headstrong revenge had driven the mad,\r\nunprincipled wretch! But what satisfaction did it create here, to read,\r\nunder the hands of the chief Ministers in France, to how low an ebb\r\nthat Court was sunk in abilities! the two Dukes owning to one another\r\nthat their poor Guerchy, as they called him, was yet the fittest\r\nman they had to employ. Among such a heap of baseness great parts\r\nappeared; and it seemed lucky for his Court that a man so likely to\r\nbe raised, and so capable of any treachery, unbosomed himself before\r\nhe was possessed of more important secrets. In some instances, as in\r\na letter to his mother, D’Eon seemed to have worked himself up to a\r\npitch of frenzy; throughout, to be swayed by intolerable vanity.[453]\r\nThe blow to Guerchy was heavy and cruel; and scarcely less mortifying\r\nto the Duc de Nivernois. Praslin, a hard, unfeeling man, took it with\r\nimplacable resentment; and yet, in one respect, acted sensibly and\r\nhonourably: instead of ruining St. Foix, the person whose letters\r\nD’Eon had, unprovoked and wickedly, disclosed, he was preferred, and\r\nnever suffered any marks of his master’s displeasure. Every possible\r\nattention was employed here to console M. de Guerchy, and to prevent\r\nhis thinking that he was lowered in the public esteem; but was it,\r\nalas! possible he could believe so? The other foreign Ministers\r\ndemanded satisfaction for so gross an insult on one of their order;\r\nand the Court was willing enough to grant any reparation in its power.\r\nBut what reparation could it make proportioned to the offence? All it\r\ncould, it did. The Attorney-General was ordered to file an information\r\nagainst D’Eon for a libel.\r\n\r\nThe imbecility of the Opposition, notwithstanding the large accession\r\nto their numbers on the question of the warrants, had left the Ministry\r\nin possession of full power. The sense of the nation had in vain\r\nappeared to be averse to them. It still continued so, wherever its\r\ngenuine voice could be heard: and never more than on the following\r\noccasion. The death of the Earl of Hardwicke had left open the honour\r\nof High Steward in the University of Cambridge. Lord Sandwich, on\r\nthe prospect of that event, had declared himself a candidate for that\r\noffice, though attended with neither salary nor power. Lord Royston,\r\nson of the deceased and now Earl of Hardwicke, was his competitor.\r\nAmbitious industry was never exerted so indefatigably as by Sandwich\r\non this occasion. There was not a corner of England, nay, not the\r\nIsle of Man, unransacked by him for votes. He ferreted out the mad,\r\nthe lame, the diseased, from their poor retreats, and imported them\r\ninto the University. Letters on letters were written, and fawning\r\napplications made to all who could influence a vote of any country\r\nclergyman. Lord Hardwicke, on the other hand, was cold, proud, and void\r\nof generosity.[454] With the clergy, indeed, he had much connection:\r\nand, being a man of no vice, and by poring over historic MSS., supposed\r\nto be learned, he seemed adapted to fill a nominal charge in a society\r\nthat is expected to be devout and studious. At least, the profligacy\r\nof Sandwich could not but be unsuitable to them, whether they had the\r\nreality, or only the semblance of religion and learning. When the day\r\nof election came on, the votes appeared to be equal, though each side\r\npretended to have a majority of one. Great altercations ensued, and\r\nthe meeting broke up in confusion; on which recourse was had to common\r\nlaw, where, after many months, a decision was pronounced in favour of\r\nLord Hardwicke. Many instances appeared of bribery practised by Lord\r\nSandwich; who, besides being rejected, experienced many insults and\r\nindignities. The under-graduates who, having no votes, had not been\r\ncourted by him, were riotous, and hissed his chief agents: and when he\r\nwent to the University in the month following, and dined in the hall\r\nof Trinity College, they marked their abhorrence of him by quitting\r\nthe hall, and refusing to dine with him! Young Thomas Pitt,[455] and\r\nFrederick Montagu,[456] Sandwich’s own cousin, who had gone down\r\nto support him, were so disgusted with his practices, and with the\r\nfactious confusion he had caused in the University, that they declared\r\nthey would assist his cause no longer. When the former told him he\r\nwould ruin the University, he replied, “That would be nothing to him:\r\nit would be the better for Oxford.” Yet himself had been bred at\r\nCambridge--but Oxford was cherished by the Court.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of April came on the election of East India Directors,\r\nwhen Sullivan’s list was chosen, though Clive had the support not only\r\nof the Administration, but of the Duke of Devonshire.[457] Sullivan\r\nhimself was elected by a majority of but one vote. He thought that in\r\nthe new Direction he had twelve votes to ten; but before the day of\r\ntheir balloting for their chairman, Lord Clive had bought off one of\r\nthem. When the election came on, Sullivan desired to be named without\r\nbeing obliged to submit to a ballot, at the same time cajoling the\r\nother party with great professions to Lord Clive. His antagonists,\r\nhowever, insisting on a ballot, the numbers appeared to be eleven and\r\neleven. Sullivan finding himself betrayed or overreached, retired with\r\nheat, and Rous, his principal enemy, was chosen chairman. Had Sullivan,\r\nwho was the creature of Lord Shelburne, succeeded, Colonel Barré was to\r\nhave gone Governor to Bengal, which was given to Lord Clive, and he was\r\nsoon after decorated with the Order of the Bath, to give dignity to his\r\nnew employment.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, to mark that Parliamentary services or disobedience\r\nwere the leading steps to favour or disgrace, Mr. Bridgman[458] was\r\nturned out of the Board of Greencloth for his vote on General Warrants;\r\nand was succeeded by Richard Vernon,[459] formerly an officer, a\r\njockey, a gamester, and brother-in-law of the Duchess of Bedford. Mr.\r\nCadogan[460] was appointed Surveyor of the Royal Gardens; and Jeremiah\r\nDyson was made one of the Lords of Trade. Of this man it is necessary\r\nto say a few more words. He was a tailor’s son, had risen under\r\nNicholas Hardinge from a subaltern clerk of the House of Commons, to\r\nsucceed him as first clerk, and by education and principle was thought\r\nand had conversed as a staunch Republican.[461] In that employment he\r\nhad comported himself with singular decency and intelligence. In truth\r\nhis parts were excellent: he was quick, subtle, shrewd, clear, both in\r\nconception and delivery, and was master of argumentative eloquence,\r\nthough void of every ornamental part of it. Being of an unhealthy\r\ncomplexion, and very fretful temper, he had quitted his laborious post,\r\nand was now come into Parliament, secretly sold to the Favourite; but\r\nfrom his behaviour as their clerk, having conciliated much goodwill to\r\nhimself among the members, he was for some time heard with great favour\r\nand satisfaction, an indulgence he lost afterwards, when his warmth\r\nmade them recollect he had once been their servant. He now appeared as\r\ndevoted to George Grenville, and indeed was excellently useful, from\r\nhis parts and great knowledge of Parliamentary business, to all who\r\nemployed him. But proving both slippery to his friends as fast as they\r\nfell, and vexatious to his enemies, few men became equally unpopular.\r\nHaving deserted Grenville on a change of times, and happening to\r\nconvert his tied wig into a bag, Lord Gower being asked the reason,\r\nsaid, “It is because no _Tye_ will hold him.”[462] Dyson will appear\r\nagain on the stage in a critical moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n  Prorogation of the Parliament.--Walpole’s Conduct on the dismissal\r\n    of General Conway for voting against Ministers on the Question of\r\n    the legality of General Warrants.--Trial of Carteret Webbe for\r\n    Perjury.--The Earl of Northumberland Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 19th the Parliament rose. And now it is that I am obliged to\r\nweave the history of my own conduct into a large part of the following\r\nnarration. Two considerable eras having taken their complexion from my\r\ncouncils, the thread of my story would be imperfect, if I omitted what\r\nrelates to my own behaviour. I shall give it as briefly as the subject\r\nand clearness will permit, and hope the reader will excuse egotisms\r\nwhere no glory was the result of my actions. Chance, more than design,\r\npresented the means; and if the moments were luckily seized, it was\r\nfrom no merit, no foresight of mine, that those moments were brought on.\r\n\r\nHaving fully seen the incapacity of the Opposition, sensible how ill\r\nthey were united, and foreseeing that their strength would rather\r\ndiminish than augment, and at the same time flattering myself, from\r\nthe resistance which the Ministry had experienced, that they would be\r\nless flippant in their innovations on liberty, which was fortified\r\nby getting rid of general warrants, I had determined to give over\r\npolitics; and to withdraw myself from shallow councils. I was preparing\r\nto make a visit to my friend and relation,[463] Lord Hertford, at\r\nParis, when, two days after the rising of the Parliament, I was stunned\r\nwith notice of Mr. Conway being turned out of the King’s bedchamber,\r\nand dismissed from the command of his regiment of dragoons. As _I_\r\nhad been a principal cause of this unworthy treatment, and of this\r\ndestruction of his fortunes, nothing could be more sensible to me than\r\nthis blow. Nor could I remain a moment in doubt, from the complexion\r\nof some in power, but that the stroke was aimed still more at me\r\nthan at Mr. Conway, though directly I was out of their reach. The\r\nBedford faction I knew were my mortal enemies. Yet I saw, too, that\r\nMr. Conway had a share in the resentment of others. Grenville was\r\nnot of a nature to pardon the slight Mr. Conway had made both of his\r\nfavour and power. He had offended Lord Sandwich, too, by refusing to\r\ninfluence the chaplain of his regiment to vote for him at Cambridge;\r\nand Lord Holland had long groaned for an opportunity of revenging\r\nhimself on Lord Hertford for his treatment of Bunbury. The tone of\r\nthe ruling Administration was despotic, nor had they forgotten how\r\nlately they had trembled with apprehension of losing their power.\r\nHere were more than motives sufficient to egg on general or particular\r\nvengeance. And in general I must leave it; for after long search and\r\nmuch information, I cannot fix the deed on any single man. There was\r\nbut one man among the suspected that ever solemnly denied having a\r\nshare in it; and he constantly did: I mean Lord Bute. All the rest\r\nhave charged it on others, though still without disavowing having had\r\na hand in it themselves. The King often afterwards protested to Lord\r\nHertford that his Ministers[464] forced him to it. Grenville declared\r\nthat his Majesty was more eager for it than any of them. The Duke of\r\nBedford alone was frank, and avowed that though he had not recommended\r\nthe measure, he had told his colleagues, when they proposed to remove\r\nMr. Conway from the bedchamber only, that it was foolish to provoke\r\nhim by halves; and that to leave him his regiment, and take away the\r\nbedchamber, would be telling other officers that they might oppose the\r\nCourt with impunity.\r\n\r\nBe it as it may, the boldness of the step was almost unprecedented.\r\nSir Robert Walpole had dismissed the Lords Westmoreland[465] and\r\nCobham[466] from the command of regiments; and Mr. Pitt from a\r\ncornetcy; but it was not till by a personal, violent, and constant\r\nopposition, that they had made themselves as obnoxious as possible.\r\nYet even that measure, provoked as it was, had occasioned great\r\nclamour; and had contributed to animate the Opposition, which at last\r\noverthrew that Minister. Mr. Grenville had joined in that Opposition,\r\nhad risen on that foundation; and the Duke of Bedford had signed a\r\nprotest against the measure of dismissing officers for parliamentary\r\nreasons. How different was the case now! The temper and fairness of the\r\nman disgraced, his aversion to faction, the disinterestedness of his\r\ncharacter, his general co-operation with the measures of Government,\r\nhis being recently recommended to favour by Prince Ferdinand for\r\nhis services in Germany, and his being brother to the ambassador at\r\nParis--all these were considerations that made the measure amazing.\r\nBut when it was observed that this punishment was inflicted for a\r\nsingle[467] vote in Parliament, when it was evident that that vote\r\nhad been peculiarly conscientious, and given in a cause avowed by the\r\nnation, and against a practice certain of being, as it soon after was,\r\ncondemned by the Courts of Law, and though maintained by Parliament\r\nin retrospect, yet given up for the future by that very Parliament\r\nas pernicious; when the context, too, appeared to be, that military\r\nmen in Parliament were to forfeit their profession and the merit of\r\ntheir services, unless implicitly devoted to the Court; could these\r\nreflections, when coupled with the arbitrary measures which the nation\r\nhad observed to be the system of the Court, fail to occasion the\r\nblackest presages? Lord Bute, in truth, had slunk away from his own\r\nvictory; but Grenville remained, and had Bute’s tools, and Sandwich\r\nand Rigby, to war with on the constitution, and Lord Mansfield and\r\nNorton ready to turn the law against itself.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful contrast, the behaviour of the person aggrieved.\r\nHis temper, decency, and submission were unalterable and unequalled.\r\nHe neither complained nor tried to instil a sense of his injuries\r\ninto a single friend, though he wished they should take his part, and\r\nresent for him. He could not have entertained a wish worse founded: his\r\nfriends were rejoiced at not being called upon; and had no ambition to\r\nshare the crown of his martyrdom. There lived not three more interested\r\nmen than the Duke of Argyle,[468] Lord Lorn, and Lord Frederick\r\nCampbell, the father and brothers of Lady Ailesbury,[469] Mr. Conway’s\r\nwife. The first loved money, and had incurred unpleasant suspicions\r\nin his efforts to obtain it. Lord Lorn[470] was sordidly covetous,\r\nand had not sense enough to foresee a blessing in futurity beyond\r\nthe first half-crown that glittered in his eyes. Lord Frederick[471]\r\nwas sensible, shrewd, and selfish; and on this and a subsequent\r\ncrisis showed that no connection or obligation could stand against\r\nthe eagerness with which he pursued immediate fortune. Nothing else\r\nweighed with him, except the inveteracy of national prejudice. As Mr.\r\nConway had acted in opposition to Scottish measures, Lord Frederick,\r\nforgetting Mr. Conway’s friendship and kindness, and his own youthful\r\nsituation, and borne away by a hot temper, often and indecently\r\nattacked him in Parliament, though without any brilliancy of parts to\r\ncolour over such improper behaviour. The Duke of Richmond, who had\r\nmarried Lady Ailesbury’s daughter, kept himself more free from blame.\r\nHe had been witness to the integrity of Mr. Conway’s conduct at the\r\nconference with Mr. Grenville, and certainly loved him, though not\r\nenough to participate his disgrace. The Duke, however, offered to take\r\na part in Parliament if Mr. Conway’s friends would move for an inquiry\r\ninto the cause of his dismission; but that offer did not include his\r\nGrace’s engaging any farther against the Court.\r\n\r\nThere was still another relation of Mr. Conway more deeply involved\r\nin his disgrace, and more immediately called upon to resent it; his\r\nbrother, Lord Hertford. Yet there were both real and specious reasons\r\nfor his submitting to it.[472] Mr. Conway had taken this part, not\r\nonly without consulting him, but when he must have known how unwelcome\r\nit would be to Lord Hertford, then in the King’s service both at home\r\nand abroad, and well treated; connected with the Ministry, and ever\r\ndesirous of being so with all Administrations. Lord Hertford had even,\r\nafter his brother’s first vote, made remonstrances to him, though in\r\nvain. On the other hand, honour, interest in a general sense, and\r\npersonal resentment, called on Lord Hertford to espouse his brother’s\r\nquarrel. Ambassador in France, where no officer was ever broken but for\r\ncowardice or some atrocious crime, it could but strike the French Court\r\nthat the Ambassador stood in little estimation at home, when such an\r\naffront was put on the family. Could he expect more consideration if he\r\nacquiesced? On the other hand, should the Opposition succeed, in which,\r\nbesides his brother, were his wife’s nephew, the Duke of Grafton,[473]\r\nand his old friends, whom he had already offended by not acting with\r\nthem, what could he expect but, at best, the humiliating circumstance\r\nof being saved by his brother whom he had abandoned? Nor could Lord\r\nHertford doubt but that Mr. Conway partly suffered on his account, as\r\nfar as Lord Holland had any share in the measure. Yet, though there had\r\nbeen no instance of such a disgrace remaining unresented, much less\r\nwhen such a character was so unjustly treated, not a single resignation\r\nmarked that the sufferer had either a friend or relation in the place.\r\nHe was at once sacrificed by the Court, and abandoned by his own family.\r\n\r\nIt became the more incumbent on me to make him all the reparation in\r\nmy power. I offered him six thousand pounds, which he refused; and I\r\naltered my will, giving him almost my whole fortune unless his regiment\r\nshould be restored to him; a destination with which I acquainted him.\r\nAnd though it certainly would not augment the gift, I determined\r\nto hazard all I had rather than not revenge both him and myself.\r\nGrenville, the very day before the dismission of Mr. Conway, whether to\r\ndetach me from him, or fearing I should make use of the indiscretion he\r\nhad been guilty of, ordered the payment of my bills at the Treasury; a\r\nstep that, far from soothing, but served to increase my resentment. I\r\ndreaded lest Mr. Conway should think I had kept any underhand measures\r\nwith the Treasury; but I soon convinced both him and the world how\r\nsteadily I embraced the cause of my friend. Yet for the first time in\r\nmy life I acted with a phlegm of which I did not know myself capable. I\r\nshut myself up in the country for three days, till I had conquered the\r\nfirst ebullitions of my rage, and then returned to town with a face of\r\nsatisfaction, which some thought indifference; and others joy at having\r\ndipped Mr. Conway in Opposition. Both were mistaken. I knew that both\r\nMr. Conway and the Opposition were little formed for the business. I\r\nhad everything to discourage me, and nothing but perseverance and the\r\nfirmness of my own temper to carry me on. I foresaw, indeed, that the\r\npersecution he had undergone would raise the character of Mr. Conway,\r\nwould lend him an importance he would never have assumed, and might one\r\nday place him at the head of this country. I foresaw that the violence\r\nand unprincipled rashness of the Ministers would conduct them to a\r\nprecipice; but I should far overrate my own sagacity, if I pretended to\r\nhave discovered that those prospects were near enough to administer any\r\ncomfort to my impatience. I knew the folly of those I was to act with.\r\nI could not flatter myself it would be exceeded by the folly of those I\r\nwas to act against.\r\n\r\nIf self-interest restrained Mr. Conway’s family from embracing his\r\ndefence, it was as natural that the Opposition should caress him.\r\nA martyr is as creditable to a party in politics as to a sect in\r\nreligion. Yet so decent and so dignified was the Opposition of that\r\ntime, that they expressed none of the heat and ardour with which\r\nparties usually seize such an event. The Duke of Devonshire, indeed,\r\ncame to me, and with great delicacy desired that I would in his name\r\nmake an offer to Mr. Conway of a thousand pounds a year, till his\r\nregiment should be restored.[474] This noble offer Mr. Conway as\r\ngenerously declined. However, it gave lustre to our cause; and it was\r\nmy purpose to raise as high as I could the character of our party, and\r\nto spread the flames of emulation from such examples. The Ministerial\r\ntools, on the other hand, were not idle, but began to defame Mr. Conway\r\nas a spiritless and inactive General, reviving in scandalous papers the\r\nmiscarriage at Rochfort.[475] This artillery, however, we turned upon\r\nthem, and displayed the malignity of not being content with ruining\r\nhim, without proceeding to the grossest defamation. Mr. Conway, too, by\r\nmy advice, called upon the detractors to avow themselves, and, if they\r\ndared, take up the weapons like men, which soon silenced that dirty\r\nkind of war.\r\n\r\nBut these prosperous beginnings were almost all I could accomplish.\r\nEvery step I took I found discouragement and disappointment. There was\r\nno union in our party, nor could I bring about any. At first I laboured\r\nto form a little junto of the most considerable of our friends in the\r\nHouse of Commons, who should plan our future measures and conduct them.\r\nBut of those I could not prevail on any three to assemble and enter\r\ninto concert. Legge was dying; Charles Yorke was proud, insincere,\r\nwaiting for an opportunity of making his own bargain, and offended that\r\nMr. Pitt was disposed to make Pratt Chancellor; though the latter,\r\nfor the good of the cause, was willing to waive the Seals. Charles\r\nTownshend, neglected by the Court, seemed zealously attached to us;\r\nunfortunately, we could neither do with him nor without him; yet his\r\njealousy of Grenville and fear of Mr. Conway would have fixed him,\r\nif anything could. There was another man of whose art and abilities\r\nI had a high opinion, and who was as practicable as the others I\r\nhave mentioned were little so,--I mean Lord George Sackville. But\r\ninsuperable difficulties kept him from us too. Pitt had proscribed him;\r\nNewcastle did not love him; the Duke of Devonshire was too cautious to\r\njoin him; and Conway, knowing Lord George had been his enemy, though it\r\nhad never come to an open rupture, would not listen to any connection\r\nwith him, but pleaded the stains on his character, and the enmity borne\r\nto him by Prince Ferdinand. I lost my temper at finding that, whilst\r\nour enemies stuck at nothing, every phantom and every fancy was to\r\nclog our councils and retard our advances. The dignity of great Lords,\r\nand their want of sense, the treachery of some, the piques of others,\r\nall had their operation, and not a single prejudice was removed to\r\nfacilitate our attempts. I had surmounted my repugnance to Newcastle,\r\nand, though in truth to little purpose, had consented to advise\r\nwith him. He was still the same; at once busy and inactive, fond of\r\nplotting, but impossible to be put in motion. Nor, indeed, propose what\r\nI would, could I obtain to have a single measure carried into execution.\r\n\r\nBut what hampered us most was Mr. Pitt. He justly resented having been\r\nabandoned by Newcastle, Devonshire, and the Whigs. He despised both\r\nCharles Yorke and Charles Townshend; and though he expressed civil\r\napplause of Mr. Conway, would neither connect with him nor see him.\r\nHe at once talked of an Administration to be composed of great Whig\r\nLords, and of his own resolution not to force himself on the King; that\r\nis, he wished the great Lords should force him on the King without his\r\nconcurrence, that he might have the merit of disavowing them, and of\r\nprofiting of their weight. Conway was as difficult as Pitt, and too\r\nproud to make any advances to him. Thus, wherever I turned, there were\r\nno facilities. Even Lord Temple, accustomed to run and meet faction\r\nin the highways, seemed cold and indisposed to connection with us. At\r\nthe same time I heard that a treaty was carrying on between him and\r\nhis brother George; a report which, though true, greatly deceived me;\r\nfor, concluding that Lord Temple was too firmly united with Mr. Pitt to\r\nnegotiate without him, I imputed the coldness of both to an approaching\r\nleague of the whole family; whereas the truth was, though then a secret\r\nto all the world, that Mr. Pitt and Lord Temple were on bad terms; the\r\nformer disapproving the violence of Temple; and Temple being enraged\r\nthat Mr. Pitt would not lend himself to all his passions.\r\n\r\nPerceiving so little hope of union amongst ourselves, I conceived a\r\nbetter prospect from the factions of the Court, which, by every art\r\nI could devise, I endeavoured to inflame. I soon learned how wide\r\nthe breach was growing between Lord Bute and Grenville; and though I\r\nthen looked on the former as the more dangerous of the two, and of\r\nall men was determined not to connect with him; yet to his friends I\r\nheld a plausible language, insinuating that it was possible he might\r\nbe forgiven by our great Lords, and left them to think that, if the\r\nFavourite withdrew his protection from Grenville and the Bedfords, his\r\ncase would by no means be desperate with the Opposition. In the same\r\nkind of style I talked to the friends of Grenville; still imputing\r\nMr. Conway’s disgrace alternately to the other faction, accordingly\r\nas I conversed with either. I saw that, hostile as they were, despair\r\nmust cement their union. Both would be more prompt to quarrel if they\r\nthought themselves not proscribed by us.\r\n\r\nAn incident fell out favourable to this plan. Grenville, ever averse\r\nto Lord Holland, had destined his place of Paymaster to be shared\r\nbetween Lord North and Stanley, and they had even taken joy on it.\r\nBut Lord Bute had prevented it being carried into execution; and Lord\r\nHolland now came from France, stung with this insult: though as the\r\npassing of his accounts was in agitation, he for the present stifled\r\nhis resentment, and affected to pay court to Grenville. As, however,\r\nto hoodwink me to his own share in that business, and to inflame my\r\nanger to Grenville, he laid the chief blame of Conway’s disgrace on\r\nthe latter, I indulged him, as usual, in the imagination that he\r\ndeceived me; and, as if to vent my own passion, blew up his as high as\r\nI could against Grenville. From Lord Holland I heard what had escaped\r\nme. Conway at the end of the Session, on a motion for thanking the\r\nKing for reducing the German demand, had made a panegyric on Prince\r\nFerdinand and the hereditary Prince, saying how hard it was that\r\n_their_ country, which had suffered so much for _us_, should not have\r\nample indemnification. Grenville had answered, that surely if the King\r\nhad been content to lower the demands for Hanover, he was at liberty to\r\nreduce those of Brunswick. This had passed in a thin debate; nor had I\r\nbeen present. But Lord George Sackville had remarked, and said, “Conway\r\nhas undone himself.” It was, it seems, an irremissible crime to applaud\r\nthe hero who had commanded our armies and given them victory; and to\r\nplead for another hero who had married the King’s own sister and fought\r\nhis battles!\r\n\r\nI shall omit the detail of many other stratagems that I formed for\r\nannoying the Administration, they having been damped or annihilated\r\nby the supineness of my confederates. The summer was in every respect\r\nunfortunate to us; and by the Session following, we scarce deserved the\r\nname of a party. Death took off some of our chief leaders, who, though\r\nthey would not lead us, yet, by the sanction of their names, had kept\r\ntogether an appearance of numbers, which dwindled away as our hopes of\r\nsuccess vanished. What farther regards us as a party will be mentioned\r\nin its place. I now return to the other occurrences of the year.\r\n\r\nTwo vacant garters were bestowed on the Duke of Mecklenberg[476] and\r\nLord Halifax. About the same time died at Paris the King’s mistress,\r\nMadame de Pompadour. She retained her power to the last, though their\r\namour had long been exhausted. The Duc de Choiseul, whom she had\r\ndestined for Minister, succeeded her in the King’s confidence without a\r\nrival.\r\n\r\nMay 4th, Beardmore, one of the persecuted writers, carried his cause\r\nagainst the messengers, and recovered one thousand pounds for damages.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th Mr. Conway’s late regiment was given to the Earl of\r\nPembroke; not without occasioning remarks a little disadvantageous to\r\nthe standard of his Majesty’s piety. Lord Pembroke, one of the wildest\r\nyoung men of the times, had been dismissed from the King’s bedchamber\r\nfor debauching and eloping with a young lady of distinction, though\r\nmarried to a more beautiful woman, sister of the Duke of Marlborough.\r\nNobody could tell what the King had to do to interfere in that\r\nintrigue: but having done so, it seemed little consistent to reward\r\na young profligate[477] with the spoils of a man strictly virtuous\r\nand conscientious. It was now remembered that at the beginning of\r\nthis reign, the Earl of Dartmouth, a young nobleman as pious as Lord\r\nPembroke was licentious, had applied to be of the King’s bedchamber,\r\nbut had been rejected by Lord Bute, lest so sanctimonious a man should\r\ngain too far on his Majesty’s piety. An instance that if it proved the\r\nreligion of the King, did not bear witness to that of the Favourite.\r\nBut in such a theatre of hypocrisy, it mattered little who was the\r\nprincipal impostor.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th died Dr. Osbaldiston, Bishop of London; and the next\r\nday Lord Chancellor Henley was created Earl of Northington, a step\r\nnot communicated to the Duke of Bedford, who much resented it. But\r\nGrenville was more mortified, who found himself excluded from the\r\nnomination of the new Bishop of London. He had wished to raise\r\nNewton[478] to that mitre, but Lord Bute procured it for Terrick. This\r\nman, with no glimmering of parts or knowledge, had, on the merit of a\r\nsonorous delivery, and by an assiduity of back-stairs address, wriggled\r\nhimself into a sort of general favour; and by timing his visits\r\nluckily, had been promoted by the Duke of Devonshire to the See of\r\nPeterborough. Yet he had been of the first, notoriously obliged to that\r\nDuke, to abandon him on his fall, sailing headlong with the tide after\r\nthe Favourite’s triumph. Again, when the Favourite retired, Terrick,\r\nwho was minister of my parish,[479] was lavish to me of invectives\r\nagainst that Lord; and sifted me eagerly to learn in what channel Court\r\nfavour was likely to flow. Having soon perceived his mistake, he had\r\nmade out a distant affinity with Worseley,[480] a creature of Lord\r\nBute, and a kind of riding-master to the King; and now to Grenville’s\r\nsurprise rose, all unworthy as he was, to so eminent a station in\r\nthe Church. This detail I communicated to Dr. Lyttelton, Bishop of\r\nCarlisle, who adhered to George Grenville amidst their family breaches;\r\nand who, being both gossiping and mischievous, kept up an acquaintance\r\nwith me of ancient date, that he might from my warmth collect\r\nmaterials to carry to Grenville. I took care to furnish him according\r\nto his wish. It was wormwood to Grenville to learn this proof of the\r\nFavourite’s still subsisting ascendant; and when I had once set them on\r\nthe scent, I knew they would touch on it in more instances than this.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd Philip Carteret Webbe was tried for perjury, being accused\r\nof having forsworn himself in the cause against Wilkes. The jury stayed\r\nout fifty-five minutes, but at last acquitted him: a vindication that\r\nno more cleared his character than conviction would have made it worse.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Northumberland[481] returned from Ireland, where his\r\nprofusion and ostentation had been so great,[482] that it seemed to\r\nlay a dangerous precedent for succeeding governors, who must risk\r\nunpopularity if more parsimonious; or the ruin of their fortune,\r\nshould they imitate his example. At his departure he broke with William\r\nGerard Hamilton,[483] his secretary, and dismissed him to make way for\r\nthe Earl of Drogheda,[484] the favourite both of Lady Northumberland\r\nand the Primate.\r\n\r\nLord Northumberland had an advantageous figure and much courtesy in\r\nhis address, which being supported by the most expensive magnificence,\r\nmade him exceedingly popular with the meaner sort. They who viewed him\r\nnearer, were not the dupes of his affability or pretensions. The old\r\nnobility beheld his pride with envy and anger; and thence were the less\r\ndisposed to overlook the littleness of his temper, or the slender\r\nportion he possessed of abilities; for his expense was a mere sacrifice\r\nto vanity, as appeared by his sordid and illiberal behaviour at play.\r\nNor were his talents more solid than his generosity. With mechanic\r\napplication to every branch of knowledge, he possessed none beyond\r\nthe surface; and having an unbounded propensity to discussion, he\r\ndisgusted his hearers without informing them. Yet his equals were but\r\nill-grounded in their contempt of him. Very few of them knew so much;\r\nand there were still fewer that had not more noxious vices, and as\r\nungenerous hearts. Lord Northumberland’s foibles ought to have passed\r\nalmost for virtues in an age so destitute of intrinsic merit.[485]\r\n\r\nThe Countess of Northumberland was a jovial heap of contradictions.\r\nThe blood of all the Percies and Seymours swelled in her veins and\r\nin her fancy; while her person was more vulgar than anything but her\r\nconversation, which was larded indiscriminately with stories of her\r\nancestors and her footmen. Show, and crowds, and junketting, were her\r\nendless pursuits. She was familiar with the mob, while stifled with\r\ndiamonds; and yet was attentive to the most minute privileges of her\r\nrank, while almost shaking hands with a cobbler. Nothing was more\r\nmean than her assiduity about the King and Queen, whom she termed her\r\n_Master_ and _Mistress_; and yet, though indirectly reprimanded by the\r\nlatter, she persisted in following her Majesty to the theatres with a\r\nlonger retinue of domestics than waited on the Queen herself. She had\r\nrevived the drummers and pipers and obsolete minstrels of her family;\r\nand her own buxom countenance at the tail of such a procession, gave it\r\nall the air of an antiquated pageant or mumming. She was mischievous\r\nunder the appearance of frankness; generous and friendly without\r\ndelicacy or sentiment.[486]\r\n\r\nLord Northumberland’s son, Lord Warkworth, was married to the third\r\ndaughter of the Favourite;[487] on which foundation the father was\r\nadmitted to the private junto, which now met daily at Mr. Stone’s.[488]\r\nIt was composed of Lord Bute, Lord Northumberland, Lord Mansfield,\r\nNorton, Stone, and the brother of the latter, the famous Primate of\r\nIreland, who bad followed the Lord-Lieutenant to London; coming,\r\nas he outwardly professed, to promote harmony and reconciliation.\r\nAs he died soon after, before he had given any specimens of his\r\narts here, I pretend not to say what were the real motives of his\r\njourney. He did visit Mr. Pitt; but a man so notorious for cunning\r\nas the Primate, was not likely to win on the _caution_ of Mr. Pitt,\r\nwho never _was explicit_, and least of all to men of abilities. It\r\nappeared, however, from the meetings I have mentioned, and other\r\nsymptoms, that the Favourite was peeping out of his lurking-hole, and\r\nwas disposed to let his power be felt. Grenville, though drunk with\r\nvanity, was sober enough to be stung with any competition; and yet\r\nhis obstinacy disgusted those whom it was most necessary for him to\r\nattach. He offended the Duke of Bedford and Lord Halifax by refusing\r\nto let the Treasury bear the whole charge of the fines imposed on\r\nthe messengers. The Duke experienced so many slights, that he kept\r\nretired in the country, and Rigby went to France, professing that it\r\nwas to be absent, lest he should be blamed if the Duke should submit\r\nto such ignominious treatment; but Rigby had, no doubt, secured the\r\nDuke’s submission before he ventured to leave him, as he called it,\r\nto himself. However, the Duke of Cumberland was so much misled by\r\nthose wayward humours, that before the end of the summer he sent Lord\r\nAlbemarle[489] to Woburn, to sound their dispositions, and endeavour to\r\ndraw them from the Court. Not one, not his own sister, Lady Tavistock,\r\nwould talk to him on politics; only the Duchess said drily, that her\r\nhusband was Minister, and that everything was done that he desired.\r\nMr. Pitt had said more truly, some time before, “They will disgust the\r\nDuke of Bedford in the spring, that they may not be teazed with his\r\nsolicitations; and they will sweeten him again by winter, with some\r\ntrifling favour, that he may give them no trouble in Parliament.”\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF THE FIRST VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LONDON:\r\n  Printed by S. & J.

It is treated by Mr. Adolphus\r\nas a simple nomination to the Privy Council, and is defended as such,\r\non the ground that the Groom of the Stole had been always constituted\r\na Privy Counsellor. This is a misconception. The empty honour of the\r\nCouncil could be grudged by no one to a great officer of the royal\r\nhousehold. The real grievance was his admission into the Cabinet.--E.\r\n\r\n[9] The Duke very soon discovered his power to be gone. Lord Bute’s\r\npredilection for the Tories was undisguised, and it soon became\r\nevident that the Court had determined to break up the Whig party, the\r\neffect of which would be to reduce the Duke to insignificance.

Walpole’s Memoirs, vol. i. p.\r\n381.--E.\r\n\r\n[12] The Duke of Bedford was no favourite of Walpole, owing to a\r\nprivate quarrel. There is no reason for suspecting that it could have\r\nbeen intended to remove his Grace from the Government of Ireland, a\r\npost which he had occupied with great reluctance (Walp. Mem. vol. ii.\r\np. 105), and was glad to vacate shortly afterwards.--E.\r\n\r\n[13] Granville Leveson, Earl Gower, brother of the Duchess of Bedford.\r\n\r\n[14] James Brudenel, brother of the Earl of Cardigan, to which title he\r\nafterwards succeeded.

The fine\r\ncollection of pictures made by his lordship at Luton, prove the\r\nmunificence and discernment with which he patronized painting. Luton\r\nitself, the building, or rather the enlargement of which he is known\r\nto have personally superintended, with many faults had likewise many\r\nbeauties, and was surpassed in taste by few of the mansions of that\r\ndate, and certainly not by Strawberry Hill. He had, in fact, a genuine\r\nlove both of painting and architecture, and his efforts to infuse\r\nthe same into the mind of his royal pupil did not entirely fail, for\r\nGeorge the Third’s example was unquestionably a great improvement in\r\nthis respect on his immediate predecessors. Of the other charges here\r\nbrought against Lord Bute, the Editor has spoken elsewhere.--E.\r\n\r\n[20] Archbishop Secker has been in more than one instance\r\nmisrepresented by Walpole. It is most improbable that he should have\r\nentertained the views here ascribed to him. As the head of the Church,\r\nit necessarily became his duty to attend frequently at Court on the\r\ncommencement of a new reign, as has since happened to his successors\r\nwithout their incurring any such imputation.--E.\r\n\r\n[21] When Prince of Wales, Scott, his sub-preceptor, reproached him\r\nwith inattention to his studies.

His name often appears in these Memoirs.\r\n\r\n[24] A Letter to the Honourable Brigadier General, Commander-in-Chief\r\nof his Majesty’s Forces in Canada.--London, 1760.--It is written\r\nwith a point and spirit, and we may add, with a degree of malignity,\r\nclosely akin to Junius, to whose pen, indeed, it has recently been\r\nascribed. (See Preface by Mr. Simons to the new edition of this\r\nPamphlet.) A reply, under the title of “Refutation of a Letter,” &c.,\r\ncomposed, evidently, under the eye of Townshend or his family, appeared\r\nshortly afterwards, and is equally intemperate, but very inferior\r\nin ability. The controversy is so far prejudicial to Townshend, as\r\nconvicting him of an ungenerous indifference to the memory of the\r\ngreat man who had led him to victory--his only excuse for the slight\r\nmanner in which he notices Wolfe in the despatch being, not “want of\r\nesteem, but because of the impropriety of writing a panegyric to a\r\nMinister, when nothing but the situation and exigence of affairs is\r\nmentioned.” Townshend virtually admitted the justice of the charge,\r\nby subsequently publishing a studied panegyric on Wolfe in the form\r\nof a private letter, though it is more in the style of his brother’s\r\nparliamentary speeches, and was probably the composition of the latter.\r\nWith respect to his opposition to Wolfe’s plan of attack, he stands\r\nentirely acquitted. The Protest made by him, in common with other\r\nofficers, had been against a plan of attack which, in consequence of\r\nthat Protest, was abandoned, and the dissentients on that occasion\r\nwere those who proposed the very attack which proved so successful.\r\nThe two generals were certainly not suited to each other. Townshend,\r\nthough brave, clever, and not devoid of good feeling, was impatient of\r\nauthority, and possessed in a singular degree the faculty of detecting\r\nand exaggerating the faults of his superiors. He had thus drawn upon\r\nhimself the resentment of the Duke of Cumberland, to whom he was under\r\ngreat obligations, and had fallen into difficulties, out of which\r\nit required the all-powerful patronage of Pitt to extricate him. A\r\npartial friend (Mr. Glover) describes him as “often led into hasty and\r\nstriking judgments of men either in approbation or censure.” Wolfe\r\nwas not of a temperament to brook sarcasm, or even opposition, from\r\na subordinate officer; and yet he had peculiarities which Townshend\r\ncould scarcely overlook. One was a confidence in himself, which, as he\r\ntook no pains to disguise it, led superficial observers to question\r\nthe reality of his merit. Just before he quitted England for the last\r\ntime, he called to take leave of Lord Temple, whom he found sitting\r\nwith a colleague. The conversation turned on the prospects of the\r\nexpedition; and some stress being laid on the resistance that might\r\nbe expected from the numbers and gallantry of the French, Wolfe rose\r\nfrom his chair, and drawing his sword, exclaimed with a loud voice,\r\nand in a menacing attitude, that there was nothing to fear; for if\r\nhe could only come within reach of the enemy, his success was not\r\na matter of doubt, but of certainty. When he left the room the two\r\nMinisters looked at each other with astonishment, and agreed, that to\r\nentrust so hazardous an expedition to such a braggart, was indeed a\r\nfearful experiment. The feeling that at all times appeared uppermost\r\nin his mind, was an insatiable appetite for glory, and desire after\r\nposthumous fame. He idolized genius either in arts or arms. Even on\r\nthe day of the attack, while sailing down the St. Lawrence, he read\r\naloud Gray’s Elegy, and observed several times to the officers with\r\nhim, that he did not know whether he would not rather be the author\r\nof that poem than the conqueror of Quebec. In truth his was a noble\r\nnature. His feelings were as genuine as they were ardent. He gave the\r\nmost minute attention to the welfare and comfort of his troops; and\r\ninstead of maintaining the reserve and stateliness so common with other\r\ncommanders of that day, his manner was frank and open, and he had a\r\npersonal knowledge of perhaps every officer in his army. We recollect a\r\nrespectable veteran, who, after having served under him at Louisburgh\r\nand Cape Breton, commanded one of the first detachments that scaled\r\nthe heights of Abraham. In that exploit Captain ---- was shot through\r\nthe lungs. On recovering his senses he saw Wolfe standing by his side.\r\nAmidst the anxieties of such a critical hour, the General stopped to\r\npress the hand of the wounded man--praised his services, encouraged\r\nhim not to abandon the hope of life--assured him of leave of absence\r\nand early promotion; nay more, he desired an aide-de-camp to give a\r\nmessage to that effect to General Monckton, should he himself fall in\r\nthe action; and, to the credit of General Monckton, the promise was\r\nkept. No wonder that these qualities coupled with brilliant success\r\nwon the hearts of the soldiery: a sort of romance still clings to\r\nhis name. He is the only British General belonging to the reign of\r\nGeorge the Second who can be said to have earned a lasting reputation.\r\nLong as this note is, it would be incomplete without some notice of\r\nGeneral Townshend. That officer was the son of Charles third Viscount\r\nTownshend, and the witty Ethelreda Harrison, and therefore the grandson\r\nof Charles second Viscount Townshend, the celebrated colleague of Sir\r\nRobert Walpole. He was not loved by either of his parents. His father,\r\na man of dissolute habits, and an unnatural parent, made for him so\r\nmean a provision, that on leaving the University he joined the army\r\nabroad as a volunteer, and he served in that capacity at the battle of\r\nDettingen. He was afterwards reduced to seek employment in the Dutch\r\nservice, but, fortunately, was disappointed, as about this time he\r\nattracted the notice of the Duke of Cumberland, through whose interest\r\nhe rose rapidly to the rank of Colonel. He attended the Duke during\r\nthe remainder of the war, and distinguished himself at Fontenoy and\r\nCulloden. Subsequently, his marriage with Lady de Ferrars, the heiress\r\nof the Northamptons, placed him at once in opulent circumstances, and\r\nhe was elected a representative for Norfolk without opposition, except\r\nfrom his father. The figure he made in the House, where he acquired\r\nconsiderable influence, especially over members in the agricultural\r\ninterest, has caused him to be often noticed (generally with censure)\r\nin these Memoirs; but though Walpole paints him in no pleasing colours,\r\non the other hand, another contemporary writer says that he was manly\r\nin person, demeanour, and sentiment, and exemplary as a husband and\r\nfather, and, from his wit, agreeable to his friends and formidable to\r\nthose he disliked. It cannot be denied, however, that he was too prone\r\nto mischief, and more worldly than seemed consistent with his love of\r\npleasure and ease. His life was singularly prosperous, and prolonged\r\nto extreme old age. He became Viscount Townshend by the death of his\r\nfather in 1764. In 1767 he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland;\r\nin 1787 he was created a Marquis, and in 1807, he died, aged 84, being\r\nthen a Field Marshal, Governor of Jersey, and Colonel of a regiment of\r\nDragoons.

Whether she did discharge any of them I neither know\r\nnor deny; some, I have heard, remained unpaid, not only at her death,\r\nbut in the year 1788.\r\n\r\n[34] George Henry Lee, Earl of Litchfield, High Steward, and afterwards\r\nChancellor of the University of Oxford, had been a zealous partisan\r\nof the House of Stuart, of which he was an illegitimate branch, his\r\ngrandfather, Edward the first Earl, having married a daughter of\r\nCharles the Second by the Duchess of Cleveland. Lord Litchfield was\r\ntoo much a man of pleasure to shine in politics, or he might at this\r\ncrisis have taken a leading part in public affairs, for his abilities\r\nwere considerable. The following ironical character of him is almost\r\nthe only instance in which Wilkes has described an opponent with\r\ncandour and truth:--“The Captain (Giddy) was a sprightly fellow in his\r\nyouth, and is remembered about twenty years ago to have made a very\r\ngood speech or two at some of your public meetings in London. From this\r\ntime, however, the figure he hath made in the world hath not been much\r\nto his credit. The chief of his company, till within these two years,\r\nhave been parsons and country squires. They used to lead him about to\r\nraces, cock-matches, and country clubs, where he was apt sometimes\r\nto drink a little too freely. A course of life of this sort brought\r\non a swimming in his head, so that he hath frequently been supposed\r\nnot to be sensible where he was, or what he was about: hence he hath\r\nbeen known in the late times of party violence, in the same sort of\r\ncompany, and within a few days of each other, to drink ‘Exclusion to\r\nthe House of Hanover, and confusion to the Stuarts.’” _North Briton,\r\nNo. 29_.--Lord Litchfield died in 1772. The title did not go beyond the\r\nthird generation, though the first Earl had thirteen sons, of whom six\r\nlived to manhood.--E.\r\n\r\n[35] Edward Harley, Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer, was grandson of\r\nthe Lord Treasurer’s brother, on whom the title had been specially\r\nlimited, on failure of issue male in the direct line. He died in 1790,\r\naged 64.--E.\r\n\r\n[36] Thomas Brudenel Bruce, Baron Bruce, youngest brother of George,\r\nEarl of Cardigan, and of the Duke of Montague. He was the fourth son of\r\nGeorge third Earl of Cardigan, by Elizabeth, only daughter of Thomas\r\nsecond Earl of Aylesbury and Baron Bruce. That barony afterwards\r\ndevolved upon him by a special limitation in the patent obtained by\r\nhis uncle Charles, the third and last Earl of Aylesbury, who also\r\nbequeathed to him the bulk of the family property. He was created Earl\r\nof Aylesbury in 1776, on the death of his uncle, and died in 1814. The\r\npresent Marquis of Aylesbury is his son.--E.\r\n\r\n[37] James Douglas, Earl of March and Ruglen, afterwards Duke of\r\nQueensberry. He died in 1810, aged 86. He possessed uncommon shrewdness\r\nand penetration, but is now only remembered by the excessive profligacy\r\nwhich stained even the last years of his life.--E.\r\n\r\n[38] Alexander Montgomery, Earl of Eglinton, an intelligent,\r\npublic-spirited nobleman. Scotland is greatly indebted to him for the\r\nagricultural improvements he introduced upon his estates in Ayrshire,\r\nand still more for the benefit of his example on other large landed\r\nproprietors. He was mortally wounded in an accidental scuffle with an\r\nofficer of Excise, whom he found poaching in his park, and died on\r\nthe 25th October, 1769. The murderer was convicted, and only escaped\r\nexecution by hanging himself in prison. Wood’s Peerage of Scotland,\r\nvol. i.--E.\r\n\r\n[39] George Broderick, Viscount Middleton. He had married the eldest\r\ndaughter of the Honourable Thomas Townshend, and great-niece of the\r\nDuke of Newcastle, and died in 1765, aged 35. He was the grandson of\r\nLord Chancellor Broderick.--E.\r\n\r\n[40] Andrew Stone, of whom see more in the preceding reign, and _infra_.\r\n\r\n[41] Smith de Burgh, Earl of Clanrickard.\r\n\r\n[42] Richard Rigby, of Mistley, near Manningtree, in Essex, Secretary\r\nto the Duke of Bedford.\r\n\r\n[43] This tract may still be read with interest. It is a masterly\r\nproduction. The style is clear and persuasive, the tone calm, and\r\nthe reasoning close and logical. The examples from English history\r\nwith which the author supports his positions are skilfully chosen and\r\nagreeably introduced, and his strictures on the King of Prussia have a\r\nsmartness and pungency that show no small command over the weapons of\r\ncontroversy. Mr. Mauduit was agent for Massachusetts. He wrote several\r\ntracts on the differences between England and her American Colonies, as\r\nwell as on subjects connected with the Dissenting interests, of which\r\nhe was a zealous and munificent promoter. He died unmarried, in June\r\n1787, aged 72. See Nichols’s Literary Anecdotes, vol. viii. p. 466; and\r\nChalmers’s Biographical Dictionary, Art. Mauduit.--E.\r\n\r\n[44] Basil Fielding, Earl of Denbigh, Lord of the Bedchamber.\r\n\r\n[45] Son of Mr. Grenville, of Wooton, and afterwards First Lord of the\r\nTreasury. He had for some time been looked upon as a very promising\r\nstatesman. Mr. Glover, in writing of him a few years before, says,\r\n“George Grenville will, I believe, make the most useful and able\r\nParliament man of the three, though not of equal eloquence with\r\nPitt.”--Mem. of a Distinguished Pol. and Lit. Character, p. 20.\r\n\r\nHis memory is embalmed in the brilliant panegyric of Mr. Burke (speech\r\non American Taxation); and a more sober, though not less friendly\r\nestimate of his merits, has been since given by Mr. Knox. (Cited in\r\nan interesting note to the Chatham Correspondence, vol. iii. p. 486.)\r\nThese prove how highly he was esteemed by his friends; and it will\r\nbe perceived in the course of this work that Walpole was not always\r\nblind to his great knowledge of the Constitution, his capacity for\r\nbusiness, and his powers as a speaker in Parliament. The unfavourable\r\nopinion, however, expressed of Mr. Grenville in the text was by no\r\nmeans confined to Walpole, his unpopularity being remarkable. Justice,\r\nindeed, was never shown to his abilities by the public--even Dr.\r\nJohnson wrote of him, “Let him not be depreciated in his grave. He had\r\npowers not universally possessed; could he have enforced payment of the\r\nManilla ransom, _he could have counted it_.” (Cited in Boswell, vol.\r\nii. p. 113.)--E.\r\n\r\n[46] Archibald Campbell, Duke of Argyle, died suddenly, March 15, 1761.\r\n\r\n[47] The King.\r\n\r\n[48] Sir Henry Erskine, though a moderate poet, was not meanly\r\naccomplished. He cultivated literature, and was a very lively\r\ncompanion. He spoke frequently in the House of Commons, and always\r\nfluently and with spirit, but in a style better suited to the hustings\r\nthan to a deliberative assembly. His career was singular. He was the\r\nsecond son of Sir John Erskine, Bart., of Alva, and succeeded to his\r\ntitle on the death of his brother, Major Sir Charles Erskine, at Holst,\r\njust before the battle of Lafeldt. He accompanied the expedition to\r\nL’Orient, as Deputy Quarter-Master General of the Forces, under his\r\nuncle, General St. Clair. Devoting himself afterwards to politics,\r\nhe shared the proscription which fell on the adherents of Leicester\r\nHouse, and was dismissed the service. The new reign amply restored\r\nhis fortunes. With his commission he soon received the command of the\r\nRoyal Scots; and in four years he had already attained the rank of\r\nLieutenant-General, when he died, in 1765, in middle life. His marriage\r\nwith Miss Wedderburn, little as it promised at the time of worldly\r\nadvantage, brought wealth and rank into his family; the earldom and\r\nproperty of her brother, Lord Chancellor Rosslyn, having devolved\r\nsubsequently on their eldest son, owing to the death of that nobleman\r\nand his brother, General Wedderburn, without issue.--E.\r\n\r\n[49] John Home, author of the tragedies of Douglas, Agis, and Siege\r\nof Aquileia; of which none save Douglas (says Sir Walter Scott)\r\nwere exhibited with remarkable applause, and one or two with marked\r\ndisapprobation. Mr. Home, though not a first-rate dramatist, was\r\na pleasing writer, well-informed, and very agreeable in society.\r\nGeorge the Third became much attached to him, and provided for him on\r\ncoming to the throne. He died in 1808, aged 84. His memoirs have been\r\nelegantly written by Mackenzie, and form the subject of one of Walter\r\nScott’s beautiful criticisms in the Quarterly Review for June 1827.--E.\r\n\r\n[50] Thomas Worseley, Surveyor General of the Board of Works.\r\n\r\n[51] George Cooke, prothonotary of the Common Pleas, and member for\r\nMiddlesex. Walpole calls him elsewhere a “pompous Jacobite.” He\r\nconducted the celebrated Westminster Petition against Lord Trentham in\r\n1751; afterwards attaching himself to Mr. Pitt, he was appointed joint\r\nPaymaster-General in 1766, and died in 1768.--E.\r\n\r\n[52] Thomas Coventry, member for Bridport. A barrister, and director of\r\nthe South Sea Company. He was son of Thomas Coventry, who was brother\r\nof William fifth Earl of Coventry.--E.\r\n\r\n[53] Alderman William Beckford, of Jamaica, member for the City of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n[54] Henry Bilson Legge, a younger son of the first Earl of Dartmouth,\r\nwas at this time Chancellor of the Exchequer. It should be remembered\r\nthat Mr. Legge had abandoned Lord Winchelsea, and attached himself\r\nto Mr. Pelham in the Cabinet schism of 1744. He shared, with many\r\nrespectable statesmen of that day, the charge of having served\r\nseveral masters, the partial changes so frequently made in the\r\nGovernment having rendered coalitions almost inevitable, especially\r\nat a time when, owing to the decline of Jacobitism, the lines of\r\ndemarcation between the different political parties had become very\r\nindistinct. None, however, with whom he acted, could deny his eminent\r\nqualifications as a man of business, or as a debater in the House of\r\nCommons on all questions of trade and finance. His political integrity\r\nis less commendable. Dodington says, that his thoughts were “_tout\r\npour la trippe_”--all for quarter-day (Diary, 407); and has, in common\r\nwith Walpole, reproached him with perfidy, in disclosing to the Duke\r\nof Newcastle the negotiations of Leicester House with the Court in\r\n1757. The more detailed account of the transaction, since published in\r\nthe posthumous memoirs of Mr. Glover, makes it far more probable that\r\nthe secret was insidiously drawn from him by the Duke, whose skill in\r\nimposing on men of superior ability to his own, is one of the most\r\nremarkable traits of his character; and that Mr. Legge was very open\r\nto such arts, may reasonably be inferred, from the well-known fact of\r\nhis having incurred the serious displeasure of George the Second by an\r\nindiscreet slip in conversation, when minister at Berlin. He had the\r\nlaxity of principle that belonged to the school of Walpole, but there\r\nis no ground for believing him to have been actually dishonest; and\r\nMr. Pelham, who knew him well, said, “that he thought him as good as\r\nhis neighbours: more able, and as willing, to serve them that served\r\nhim as anybody he had been acquainted with for some time.” Whatever\r\nmay have been his delinquencies in this respect, they would certainly\r\nhave been overlooked by the Court, had he added to them by adopting the\r\ncourse which was urged on him by Lord Bute in the Hampshire election.\r\nThis is proved by their published correspondence, in which he had a\r\ngreat advantage over Lord Bute. When that minister had the assurance\r\nto ask him to support Sir Simeon Steuart, who had come forward on the\r\nopposite interest, he honestly answered, “If the Whigs and Dissenters,\r\nwho are very numerous in this country, will make it a point of opposing\r\nhim, it will be impossible for me to declare for him, and abandon those\r\nwho have supported me, to take part with those against whom they have\r\nsupported me.” Lord Bute’s rejoinder is admirable! he protests against\r\nany desire on the Prince’s part to require the sacrifice of Mr. Legge’s\r\nhonour, but besought him out of real friendship, to consider seriously\r\nwhether he could not still, as far as was in his power, co-operate with\r\nthe Prince’s wishes for the return of two candidates, and required\r\na categorical answer. This was at once given in the negative by Mr.\r\nLegge, who added, that he would submit to any consequences rather than\r\nincur such a disgrace. Hence his dismissal. See more of Mr. Legge\r\n_infra_.--E.\r\n\r\n[55] Daniel Finch, Earl of Winchelsea and Nottingham, Knight of the\r\nGarter. Lord Winchelsea is one of the few statesmen of the reign of\r\nGeorge the Second whose character is worthy of a purer age. He was\r\nthe son of Lord Winchelsea, the great Tory leader, whose disgrace he\r\nshared when that nobleman was dismissed for espousing the cause of\r\nthe Jacobite peers involved in the rebellion of 1715. He subsequently\r\nbecame reconciled to Sir Robert Walpole, and in 1742 was appointed\r\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty. Lord Waldegrave says of his conduct at\r\nthat period, “That it was so unexceptionable that faction itself was\r\nobliged to be silent.”--Walpole Memoirs, p. 139. Horace Walpole is\r\nequally warm in his praise. This is the testimony of political friends,\r\nbut it stands uncontradicted. Indeed Lord Winchelsea appears to have\r\nenjoyed the respect of all parties. His public career, to use the\r\nwords of Lord Mahon, “without being illustrious, was long, useful, and\r\nhonourable.” He died in 1769, aged 81.--E.\r\n\r\n[56] William Wildman Shute Barrington, Viscount Barrington, Treasurer\r\nof the Navy.\r\n\r\n[57] Robert Darcy, Earl of Holderness. This is an exaggeration of Lord\r\nHolderness’s incapacity; for it appears by the Mitchell papers, that\r\nhe had attended closely to the business of his office, and performed\r\nit respectably. His talents, however, were not above mediocrity. His\r\nforeign connexions had recommended him to George the Second, whom\r\nhe attended as Lord of the Bedchamber at the battle of Dettingen,\r\nand he was afterwards minister at Turin and at the Hague. The Duke\r\nof Newcastle succeeded in making him Secretary of State, against\r\nthe opinion of Mr. Pelham, when scarcely thirty years of age. His\r\nqualifications for that high office are thus summed up by the Duke,\r\nin a letter, urging the appointment:--“He is indeed, or was thought,\r\ntrifling in his manner and carriage; but believe me, he has a solid\r\nunderstanding, and will come out as prudent a young man as any in the\r\nkingdom. He is good-natured, so that you may tell him his faults, and\r\nhe will mend them. He is very taciturn, dexterous enough, and most\r\npunctual in the execution of his orders. He is got into the routine of\r\nbusiness, and knows well the present state of it.” (Letter from Duke of\r\nNewcastle to Mr. Pelham, in Coxe’s Life of Pelham, vol. ii. p. 387.) A\r\nportrait not less characteristic of the Duke than of Lord Holderness.\r\nHis lordship married a lady of the Fagel family, and his mother was\r\ndaughter of the last Duke of Schomberg. He died 1778, without issue\r\nmale, and his earldom became extinct. See more of him in Walpole’s\r\nMemoirs, vol. i. p. 172; and Lord Waldegrave’s Memoirs, p. 121.--E.\r\n\r\n[58] James Grenville, second brother of Earl Temple. He had already\r\nbeen Deputy Paymaster General, and one of the Lords of Trade, and,\r\nlastly, of the Treasury.--E.\r\n\r\n[59] John Manners, Duke of Rutland, Knight of the Garter, died in 1779,\r\nat the age of 83, having survived his gallant and amiable son, the\r\nMarquis of Granby.--E.\r\n\r\n[60] Samuel Lord Sandys, formerly the indefatigable opponent of Sir\r\nRobert Walpole; but his importance had greatly diminished since that\r\nminister’s downfall. He died in 1770.--E.\r\n\r\n[61] Thomas Osborne, Duke of Leeds, Knight of the Garter. He married\r\nMary, daughter and co-heir of Francis Earl of Godolphin, and died in\r\n1783, aged 76.--E.\r\n\r\n[62] Charles Townshend, second son of Charles Viscount Townshend.\r\n\r\n[63] Gilbert Elliot, afterwards Sir Gilbert.\r\n\r\n[64] George Bussy Villiers, Viscount Villiers, only son of the Earl\r\nof Jersey, whom he afterwards succeeded. He held the post of Lord\r\nChamberlain from 1765 to 1769, and subsequently filled other high\r\noffices in the royal household. He died in August, 1805, aged 70.--E.\r\n\r\n[65] T. Pelham, of Stanmore, afterwards Lord Pelham.\r\n\r\n[66] George Rice married Cecil, only child of William Lord Talbot, and\r\na great heiress. He was Lord Lieutenant of the county of Carmarthen,\r\nand a Privy Councillor. He died in 1779. The present Lord Dynevor is\r\nhis son.--E.\r\n\r\n[67] John Spencer, only son of John Spencer, brother of Charles Duke\r\nof Marlborough. He was a person of very resolute, independent spirit,\r\nand warmly attached to the Whig interest, as he too well proved at\r\nthe celebrated Northampton election, which seriously impaired even\r\nhis immense fortune, while it made Lord Northampton an exile for the\r\nremainder of his life, and obliged Lord Halifax to sell Horton and his\r\nprincipal estates. With the exception of a very brief interval, Lord\r\nSpencer remained all his life in Opposition. He died greatly respected\r\nin 1783, aged 49. The present Earl Spencer is his grandson.--E.\r\n\r\n[68] Sir Thomas Robinson, created Lord Grantham, had been minister at\r\nVienna, and Secretary of State. He was the fourth son of Sir William\r\nRobinson, Baronet. His fortunate connexion with Horace Lord Walpole, to\r\nwhom he had been Secretary in 1723, quickly raised him to eminence. He\r\nwas an excellent man of business, and highly esteemed as a diplomatist.\r\nHis despatches are written with great spirit and clearness. In the\r\nHouse of Commons he failed, as might have been expected from his\r\nprevious pursuits, and his talents have in consequence been much\r\nunderrated. He died in 1770. The Earl de Grey and the Earl of Ripon are\r\nhis grandsons.--E.\r\n\r\n[69] Sir Nathaniel Curzon, (fifth Baronet, and M. P. for Derbyshire,)\r\ncreated Lord Scarsdale. He afterwards was appointed Chairman of the\r\nCommittee of the House of Lords, and died at an advanced age, in\r\n1804.--E.\r\n\r\n[70] Sir William Irby, created Lord Boston. He had been Page to George\r\nI. and George II., and Equerry to the Prince on the arrival of the\r\nlatter in England. He married a niece of Mr. Selwyn, and died in 1773,\r\naged 66.--E.\r\n\r\n[71] George Bubb Dodington, created Lord Melcomb.\r\n\r\n[72] William Pulteney, Earl of Bath.\r\n\r\n[73] Son of the Lord Chancellor. He had in his youth been one of Sir\r\nRobert Walpole’s most violent opponents. The Count de Fuentes, in a\r\nletter to Mr. Wall, of 27th March, says that this appointment was\r\nascribed to the Princess of Wales: of whom he adds, “they speak with\r\ntoo much liberty.”--Chatham Corresp. vol. ii. p. 106. The adherence\r\nof Lord Talbot to the Leicester House party certainly entitled him to\r\nconsideration, but he was now much overpaid; and this was felt even by\r\nhis patron Lord Bute, who wanted firmness to resist pretensions which\r\nwere urged with impetuosity, amounting almost to passion.--(Dodington’s\r\nDiary, cited in note to the letter _supra_.) Lord Talbot had talents,\r\nwas resolute and ready; and his speeches had an air of independence\r\nand a plausibility that made him rather a favourite with the public,\r\nnotwithstanding his vices, until his duel with Wilkes brought ridicule\r\nupon his name, not to be effaced.--E.\r\n\r\n[74] Son of Selina Countess of Huntingdon. He remained Groom of the\r\nStole till 1770. Akenside, who was one of the least adulatory of\r\npoets, addressed to him, in 1747, a didactic ode on his setting out\r\non his travels. He was an amiable and accomplished nobleman, though\r\nit requires some partiality to believe of his early youth that his\r\n“breast the gifts of every Muse had known.” Delicate health prevented\r\nhis taking an active part in public business, and in 1766 he declined\r\nthe embassy to Spain, which was pressed on him by Lord Chatham. He died\r\nin 1790, aged 62, without having been married, and the title was for\r\nsome years supposed to be extinct. In 1819 the father of the present\r\nEarl established a claim to it, and took his seat in the House of Lords\r\naccordingly.--E.\r\n\r\n[75] See page 39, and _infra_.\r\n\r\n[76] Henry Seymour Conway, only brother of Francis Earl of Hertford.\r\n\r\n[77] John Waldegrave, only brother of James Earl Waldegrave, whom he\r\nsucceeded in the title, married Lady Elizabeth Leveson Gower, sister\r\nof Gertrude Duchess of Bedford. His presence of mind and intrepidity\r\nat the battle of Minden established his character as a soldier.--Mem.\r\nvol. ii. p. 367. He was appropriately rewarded with the regiment of\r\ndragoons, vacated by Lord George Sackville’s dismissal. Subsequently he\r\nobtained one of the regiments of foot-guards, and was made Master of\r\nthe Horse to the Queen. His love of state, not less than the handsome\r\nmanner in which he lived, well adapted him to any great office at\r\nCourt. He died in 1784. His eldest son, a most respectable nobleman,\r\nand also an officer, only survived him five years.--E.\r\n\r\n[78] John Mostyn, brother of Sir Roger Mostyn, Bart., and Groom of\r\nthe Bedchamber to the King. He had commanded the British cavalry with\r\ndistinction in Germany, and was mainly instrumental in gaining the\r\nBattle of Warburgh, the credit of which Lord Granby ascribed entirely\r\nto him. He might have risen high in the army, had he not shrunk from\r\nthe responsibility of great commands. He refused the command of the\r\nexpedition to the Havannah, on the ground that he did not pretend to be\r\nmore than a cavalry officer. His good nature and conviviality, as well\r\nas his quiet military deportment, made him popular at Court; and George\r\nthe Second liked him so much, that he generally formed one of the\r\nKing’s evening party. It was believed he might have been a favourite if\r\nhe pleased.

He was the second son of Sir Erasmus\r\nPhilipps, and had succeeded to the title and estates on the death of\r\nhis elder brother. He died in 1764, leaving an only son, Sir Richard,\r\nwho was afterwards created an Irish Peer by the title of Lord Milford,\r\nand died without issue in 1823.--E.\r\n\r\n[82] Henry, brother of Thomas Lord Archer.\r\n\r\n[83] Mr. Onslow died in February 1768, aged 76.

He had been a captain of the Guards, and aide-de-camp\r\nof the Duke of Cumberland at the battle of Fontenoy. In 1751 he\r\nwas appointed Minister at the Hague, where he remained many years,\r\nand became almost naturalized, having married a Dutch lady. His\r\nestimable conduct, and also his splendid hospitality, gave him great\r\nconsideration in Holland. In 1788 he was created Lord Dover. He died in\r\n1792 without issue, and the title became extinct.--E.\r\n\r\n[90] Admiral Edward Boscawen, brother of Lord Viscount Falmouth, a\r\ndistinguished naval commander.

Bussy was one of the chief Commis of the Foreign Department at\r\nParis. He had great experience in business, and was eminently adroit\r\nand persuasive; qualities to which he owed his nomination to this\r\ndifficult post. Formerly he had been private secretary to the Duc de\r\nRichelieu, through whose interest he was employed on a mission to\r\nGeorge the Second in Hanover in 1754.

It is ably drawn,\r\nand not unkindly, considering the belief long entertained by the Whigs\r\nof the Duke having betrayed Sir Robert Walpole. The more favourable\r\nportrait given by Archdeacon Coxe, from materials supplied by his\r\nfamily, is, like too many family portraits, feeble, flattering, and\r\nindistinct. His Grace unquestionably possessed a powerful, active,\r\nand cultivated mind. He had studied, and thoroughly understood the\r\nweaknesses of men, and was unscrupulous in the practice of all the arts\r\nof intrigue. Success usually crowned his efforts, and notwithstanding\r\nthe various changes of Government, he maintained much of his power\r\nto the last. Disappointment attended only his private life, which\r\nwas chilled by aversion to his wife and the want of children. _Il\r\nfut riche, il fut titré, mais il ne fut point heureux_--the just and\r\nnatural result of a line of conduct which, as Lord Mahon correctly\r\nobserves, was seldom on any occasion swayed either by virtue or\r\ngenerosity.--Coxe’s Life of Sir R. Walpole, vol. iv. p. 236; Mahon’s\r\nHist. vol. iii. p. 237.--E.\r\n\r\n[94] This prediction has not been realized. The Bangorian controversy\r\nhas long lost its interest, and great as was their success in\r\ntheir day, and great their reward--no less than the Bishoprick of\r\nWinchester--the three massive folios of Hoadley’s Works now slumber on\r\nthe shelves of theological libraries. His two sons, one of whom was\r\nchaplain, and the other physician to the King, were men of talent, and\r\nare still recollected as the joint authors of that popular comedy, “The\r\nSuspicious Husband.” They were the last of their family.--E.\r\n\r\n[95] John Hay, Marquis of Tweedale, had been secretary of State for\r\nScotland. Lord Tweedale had been one of the extraordinary Lords of\r\nSession in Scotland, and also had held the post of Secretary of\r\nState for that country. He was the last person that filled either of\r\nthese offices. His connexion with Lord Granville, whose daughter he\r\nhad married, brought him into public life in opposition to Walpole,\r\nand he shared the spoils of that minister. Like Lord Granville, he\r\npossessed considerable knowledge of law. He is said also to have been\r\na good debater in Parliament. He died, without male issue, in December\r\n1762.--E.\r\n\r\n[96] Dr. Robert Hay Drummond, brother of the Earl Kinnoul.\r\n\r\n[97] Richard Edgcumbe, second Lord Edgcumbe, an intimate friend of\r\nthe author, who has given him a place in the Noble Authors. He was a\r\nhumourist, and had a turn for poetry and drawing, of which some amusing\r\nspecimens are noticed in the publications of his day. Walpole says, he\r\nnever had a fault but to himself, never an enemy but himself.--E.\r\n\r\n[98] Lady Caroline Lenox, eldest daughter of Charles second Duke of\r\nRichmond, married to Henry Fox, Paymaster of the Forces.\r\n\r\n[99] Eldest daughter of Stephen Fox, Earl of Ilchester, by the sole\r\ndaughter and heiress of Mr. Strangways Horner, whose name he assumed.\r\n\r\n[100] Holland House, beyond Kensington, the seat of the Earls of\r\nWarwick and Holland; now of Henry Fox, Lord Holland.\r\n\r\n[101] John Fane, Earl of Westmoreland, Chancellor of Oxford,\r\nLieutenant-general in the army, and formerly captain of one of the\r\ntroops of Horse Guards. In early life, when a younger brother, and\r\na Whig, he had served under the Duke of Marlborough; and afterwards\r\ncommanded “the body of troops which George the First had been obliged\r\nto send to Oxford, to teach the University the only kind of passive\r\nobedience of which they did not approve.” He subsequently joined the\r\nJacobites in their opposition to Sir Robert Walpole, and became a\r\nhigh Tory; as indeed may be inferred from Lord Arran appointing him\r\nHigh Steward of the University in 1754, and from his succeeding that\r\nnobleman as Chancellor in 1758. He was comely in his person, and highly\r\nrespected for his virtues in private life. Glover describes him as “a\r\nveteran patriot, slow, but solid; always meaning well, and therefore\r\njudging right.” He died without issue in 1762, at a very advanced\r\nage. Walpole’s Memoirs, vol. ii. p. 340. Memoirs of a distinguished\r\nPolitical and Literary Character, p. 121.--E.\r\n\r\n[102] Sir Philip Yorke, Earl of Hardwicke, formerly Lord Chancellor.\r\n\r\n[103] John Carteret, Earl of Granville, some time Prime Minister to\r\nGeorge the Second.\r\n\r\n[104] Simon Lord Harcourt, formerly Governor to the King. See an\r\naccount of his resignation of that post, in the preceding reign,\r\n(Memoirs of George the Second, vol. i. p. 254.)\r\n\r\n[105] Mary Panton, second wife of Peregrine Bertie, Duke of Ancaster.\r\n\r\n[106] Elizabeth Gunning, Duchess Dowager of Hamilton, married,\r\nsecondly, to John Campbell, Marquis of Lorn, eldest son of John Duke of\r\nArgyle.\r\n\r\n[107] Mr. Hammond had been in love with her, and then forsaken her. The\r\npoems which he wrote on her have been published.\r\n\r\n[108] Mr. Andrew Stone was appointed Treasurer to the Queen on her\r\narrival. He was the well-known confident of the Duke of Newcastle and\r\nMr. Pelham, over both of whom he exercised great influence. He had\r\nbeen private, and afterwards under secretary to the former. Latterly\r\nhe had been sub-governor to the King when Prince of Wales. He was a\r\nfine scholar, and had distinguished himself at Oxford, where he was\r\nthe rival and friend of Murray (Lord Mansfield). Bishop Newton, who\r\nknew him well, says that his tastes and feelings were better suited\r\nto the Church than to politics. Lord Waldegrave likewise commends\r\nhis integrity. Walpole can find no fault in him, except that he had\r\na tendency to Jacobitism, a charge which his conduct and connections\r\nproved to be unfounded. He appears to have been entirely devoid of\r\nambition, honest, and most disinterested. He died in 1773, aged 72. The\r\nbest account of Mr. Stone is in a note to Coxe’s Life of Pelham, vol.\r\ni. p. 430.--E.\r\n\r\n[109] She did some years afterwards with the King, but quite in private.\r\n\r\n[110] Dr. Robert Hay Drummond, brother of the Earl of Kinnoul, and\r\nBishop of Salisbury, a man of parts and of the world. He was the\r\nsecond son of George eighth Earl of Kinnoul, formerly Ambassador at\r\nConstantinople. He had attended George the Second in the campaign of\r\n1743, and preached the thanksgiving sermon at Hanover, for the battle\r\nof Dettingen. On his return he was made a prebendary of Westminster,\r\nand in 1748 Bishop of St. Asaph. He was a dignified and accomplished\r\nprelate. He died in 1776, in his 66th year. In 1803 one of his younger\r\nchildren, the late Mr. George Drummond, published a volume, intituled\r\n“Sermons on Public Occasions, and a Letter on Theological Study, by\r\nRobert, late Archbishop of York,” &c. The Archbishop’s eldest son\r\nbecame tenth Earl of Kinnoul.--E.\r\n\r\n[111] Dr. Hayter was supposed to be the natural son of Dr. Blackburne,\r\nArchbishop of York. This supposition is indignantly attacked in\r\nan article on the first part of these Memoirs, in the Quarterly\r\nReview. In justice to Walpole, it is only fair to state, that this\r\nwas a report generally believed at the time. In the quarrel in\r\nthe Princess’s household which led to the Bishop’s disgrace, Mr.\r\nCresset, the Princess’s confident, was charged with calling him a\r\nbastard.--Edinburgh Review, No. 73, p. 5, note. The suspicious report\r\nwas rather strengthened than otherwise by Archbishop Blackburne’s\r\nleaving him a large fortune. What is of more importance to Bishop\r\nHayter’s memory is, that he bore a high character for generosity and\r\nlearning. He only survived his translation a single year, having died\r\nin 1762, aged 59. Nichols’s Literary Anecdotes, vol. ii. p. 505.--E.\r\n\r\n[112] There were at this time two bishops of the same name; Dr. John\r\nThomas, Bishop of Winchester, and Dr. John Thomas, Bishop of Lincoln:\r\nthe latter had been promoted by Lord Granville.\r\n\r\n[113] George William Hervey, Earl of Bristol, Ambassador in Spain, son\r\nof the famous John Lord Hervey.\r\n\r\n[114] Charles third King of Spain, and before of Naples; commonly\r\ncalled Don Carlos.\r\n\r\n[115] The Duke positively denied having made any such communication to\r\nBussy. See _infra_.--E.\r\n\r\n[116] The following note is transcribed from the manuscript memoirs of\r\nSir George Colebrooke, Bart., M.P., Chairman of the East India Company;\r\nan eminent merchant, who sat many years in Parliament, and possessed\r\nthe confidence of some of the leading statesmen of his day.\r\n\r\n“During the time I attended Newcastle House and the Treasury Chambers\r\non the Contract business, I had frequent opportunities of knowing how\r\ndespotically Mr. Pitt governed his ministerial colleagues, and how\r\nmuch he was dreaded by the Duke. Some years afterwards I recollect\r\nhis Grace making this the subject of lively conversation at table,\r\nat Claremont; but it was no subject of merriment at the time the\r\ntransaction passed. More than once I was summoned to the Treasury to\r\ngive an account of the state of the provisions, and of the money, for\r\nthe army, Mr. West giving, for reason, that Mr. Pitt threatened the\r\nDuke, that if at any time a want of either should be found, he would\r\nimpeach him in the ensuing session. At the Treasury I frequently met\r\nMr. Wallis, Commissioner of the Navy, who mentioned the following\r\nmemorable instance. A train of artillery was wanted at Portsmouth for\r\nan expedition. Mr. Pitt told Wallis that it must be down by a certain\r\nday he named. Wallis made some excuse for the delay, either that the\r\ntransports were not ready or the winds were contrary; upon which Mr.\r\nPitt insisted that they should go by land, a method of conveyance which\r\nwas afterwards pursued.\r\n\r\n“General Harvey, who had been sent by Prince Ferdinand to prepare\r\nmatters in England for the campaign, and to carry over the English\r\ndraughts, waited on Mr. Pitt to take his leave. Mr. Pitt asked him\r\nwhether he had obtained everything he wanted, and the General answered,\r\nnot; and he therefore came to take leave, that no blame might fall on\r\nhim from the Prince. Mr. Pitt desired the General to enumerate what he\r\nwanted, and immediately rang his bell for Mr. Wood, who in the names\r\nof the different Boards signified to their officers his Majesty’s\r\ncommands for the dispatch of what was required for Germany, and in four\r\ndays General Harvey had in readiness what he had been as many months\r\nsoliciting.\r\n\r\n“West, the Secretary, always looked frightened; and well he might, for\r\nMr. Pitt would have been as good as his word, which was to impeach the\r\nCommissioners of the Treasury, if they neglected anything needful for\r\nthe war. At times he depended so little on them, that, notwithstanding\r\na contract to supply the army, he caused provisions to be sent by\r\nvictualling transports.\r\n\r\n“Proceeding in the way I have mentioned, of writing in the names of\r\nthe different public officers, there were numberless hiatus in their\r\nbooks of correspondence, and instances of orders carried into execution\r\nwithout their sanction. The name of Lord Barrington was principally\r\nused as Secretary at War, who did not know more than a stranger of\r\ntroops being ordered on service, till the embarkation had actually\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\n“The Duke of Newcastle, speaking himself of the cavalier manner\r\nwith which Mr. Pitt treated the Cabinet, mentioned the instance of\r\nsome foreign expedition which Mr. Pitt had proposed, but which, in\r\nthe opinion of the ministers, and of Lord Anson, First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty, deprived Great Britain of too great a part of its internal\r\ndefence. Lord Mansfield had not yet given his opinion; but Mr. Pitt,\r\napprehensive that it would be against him, summed up the opinions of\r\nCouncil, a majority of which he declared to be for the expedition;\r\nadding, “The Chief Justice of England has no opinion to give in this\r\nmatter thereby stopping his mouth. The Duke told Lord Coventry, that\r\nMr. Murray, when Attorney-General, and in the House of Commons, had\r\nacknowledged to him that he was intimidated by Pitt. The more the\r\nlatter found Murray to be intimidated, the more he naturally pressed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“I never saw the Duke in higher spirits than after Mr. Pitt, thwarted\r\nby the Cabinet in his proposal of declaring war against Spain, had\r\ngiven notice of resignation. The Duke had done more wisely, if he had\r\nfollowed Lord Hardwicke’s advice, and had resigned on the death of his\r\nlate master. The Duke could not endure to part with his power, much\r\nless to devolve it on one who meant to keep it. When he last resigned\r\nthe Treasury to the Duke of Devonshire, it was with a view to have it\r\nback again at a convenient season.”--E.\r\n\r\n[117] The following extraordinary notice was published in the Gazette\r\nof the 9th October: “The Right Honourable William Pitt having resigned\r\nthe Seals into the King’s hands, His Majesty was this day pleased to\r\nappoint the Earl of Egremont to be one of His Majesty’s principal\r\nSecretaries of State; and, in consideration of the great and important\r\nservices of the said Mr. Pitt, His Majesty has been graciously pleased\r\nto direct that a warrant be prepared for granting to the Lady Hesther\r\nPitt, his wife, a Barony of Great Britain, by the name, style, and\r\ntitle of Baroness of Chatham, to herself, and of Baron of Chatham to\r\nher heirs male, and also to confer upon the said William Pitt, Esq., an\r\nannuity of three thousand pounds sterling, during his own life and that\r\nof Lady Hesther Pitt, and their son John Pitt, Esq.”--E.\r\n\r\n[118] It certainly is not the practice now (1844) to insert pensions in\r\nthe Gazette. Whether it ever was so it would be difficult to ascertain,\r\nas there is no index prior to the year 1787. The impression of two very\r\nold officers, who have frequent occasions to consult the Gazette, is,\r\nthat no such general practice ever prevailed.--E.\r\n\r\n[119] It was by such expressions as this that Mr. Pitt created the\r\ndisappointment in the public mind, that followed the announcement of\r\nhis pension. To use the words of Lord Brougham: “He did not sustain\r\nthe exalted pitch of magnanimous independence, and utter disregard of\r\nsublunary interests, which we should expect him to have reached and\r\nkept as a matter of course, from a mere cursory glance at the mould in\r\nwhich his lofty character was cast.” Statesmen of the Time of George\r\nIII., 1st series, p. 45. A pension of £4000 a year to Lord Holderness\r\npassed without a murmur, while one of £3000 a year to Mr. Pitt raised\r\na general burst of indignation, only because the country regarded the\r\nlatter as lowering their idol to the level of the jobbing statesmen of\r\nthe day. The cry against Mr. Pitt was, indeed, almost universal. See\r\nletter to Mr. Conway, vol. iv. of Walpole’s Collected Correspondence,\r\np. 184; and particularly the note containing the opposite opinions of\r\nMr. Gray and Mr. Burke. Mr. Pitt’s noble refusal of the vast emoluments\r\nof the Pay-office, which so enriched those who preceded and succeeded\r\nhim as Paymaster, entitles his conduct in all pecuniary matters to a\r\nliberal construction from posterity. What is really to be regretted, is\r\nthe humiliating tone of his correspondence with Lord Bute, in accepting\r\nthe pension (Chatham Correspondence, vol. ii. p. 152,) and his language\r\nat his interview with the King on that occasion.--Annual Register for\r\n1761. But we will not dwell on the defects of a man who certainly was\r\nfar above his age, not only in talent, but in real independence.--E.\r\n\r\n[120] Thomas Prowse, member for Somersetshire, which he had represented\r\nin five successive Parliaments, having been every time unanimously\r\nelected. He was an opulent, well-informed, and influential country\r\ngentleman. He died, after a long illness, in 1767, aged 59, and was\r\nburied in Axbridge Church; where the long panegyric on his tomb\r\nstates--“That though frequently solicited, he never could be prevailed\r\nupon to accept any employment in the state.” Collinson’s History of\r\nSomerset, vol. iii. p. 563.--E.\r\n\r\n[121] Edward Bacon, of Earlham Hall, Norfolk, barrister-at-law, and\r\nM. P. for Norwich. He was son of Walter Bacon, of Earlham Hall, and\r\nM. P. for Norwich. Mr. Edward Bacon had been member for Lynn in\r\n1742. He represented Norwich from 1752 to 1784, when he retired from\r\nParliament. He died in March 1786, and was buried in the chancel of\r\nEarlham Church.

He added to great industry, a considerable knowledge\r\nof Parliamentary history and constitutional law; and his amiable\r\ndisposition and obliging temper were no insignificant recommendations\r\nto the Speakership. He was a Lincolnshire country gentleman, of ancient\r\nfamily, and had inherited a great estate from his mother, the heiress\r\nof the Tyrconnels.--E.\r\n\r\n[123] Sir Hugh Smithson Percy, Earl of Northumberland.\r\n\r\n[124] John Berkeley, fifth and last Lord Berkeley of Stratton.

He was the friend\r\nof Dr. Johnson, and the patron of Robert Burns; and is described by\r\nMr. Croker as a man of talents and very agreeable manners. He took an\r\nactive part in all the debates of the House on East India questions;\r\nand was one of the few who, after defending Warren Hastings, gave a\r\nzealous support to Fox’s India Bill. He died about the year 1790, at a\r\nvery advanced age. Croker’s Boswell, vol. i. p. 418. Annual Necrology,\r\nvol. iii. p. 141.--E.\r\n\r\n[130] Peregrine Cust.

[He represented the county of Suffolk for forty-five\r\nyears, and died in March 1821, in his 81st year. He forsook politics\r\nfor horse-racing, which he found a more congenial pursuit, and was\r\nlong considered as the father of the turf. See more of him in Selwyn’s\r\nCorrespondence, vol. ii. p. 180.--E.]\r\n\r\n[140] At the conferences held there previously to the Treaty of Utrecht.\r\n\r\n[141] In twenty-eight years, viz. to 1788, the King has not once been\r\nat Hanover, nor seems to design it.\r\n\r\n[142] Additional particulars respecting Colonel Barré are given in\r\nChatham Correspondence, vol. ii. p. 41, 168-171. See especially the\r\nnotes, containing extracts from the Mitchell MSS.--E.\r\n\r\n[143] Richard Glover, a merchant, who, by superior intelligence, great\r\nfluency of speech in public, and some reputation as a poet, had gained\r\nconsiderable influence in the City, and was thought of sufficient\r\nimportance to be admitted into the councils of Leicester House. This\r\ndistinction, and the success of his poems, which had all a political\r\ntendency, made him fancy himself on an equality with Pitt, Lyttelton,\r\nand the other men of talent who surrounded the Prince of Wales. The\r\nillusion was painfully dispelled. The sudden death of the Prince broke\r\nup the party; Mr. Glover’s services were no longer required; and\r\nhappening to be at the time under commercial embarrassments, he sank\r\ninto obscurity. In a few years, however, by diligent application, and a\r\nsuccessful speculation in the copper trade, he retrieved his fortunes,\r\nbut he never forgave the neglect of his former associates; and the\r\nmemoirs he left behind him show the angry feelings he entertained,\r\nparticularly against Mr. Pitt. To this circumstance he probably\r\nowed his seat for Weymouth, the borough being one of those which\r\nMr. Dodington placed at the disposal of Lord Bute. Mr. Glover died\r\nin 1785, aged 73. His autobiography from 1742 to 1757 was published\r\nin 1813, under the title of Memoirs of a Distinguished Literary and\r\nPolitical Character. They are not without spirit, but show few signs of\r\na powerful mind, and are in every respect inferior to what might have\r\nbeen expected from him.--E.\r\n\r\n[144] James Oswald, of Brunnikier, joint Vice-Treasurer of Ireland.\r\n\r\n[145] Dr. George Hay, of the Commons, one of the Commissioners of the\r\nAdmiralty.\r\n\r\n[146] George Cooke, Prothonotary, member for Middlesex.\r\n\r\n[147] Second son of John Duke of Argyle, for many years Lord Register\r\nof Scotland in Mr. Pitt’s administration.--E.\r\n\r\n[148] Robert Nugent, Esq., of Gosfield, in Essex, afterwards Earl\r\nNugent. See _infra_.\r\n\r\n[149] This became a stronger truth every day.\r\n\r\n[150] Mr. Gascoyne was the only son of Sir Crispe Gascoyne, Lord Mayor\r\nof London, from whom he inherited a considerable estate. He had a\r\nstrong understanding, and was esteemed highly as a man of business.\r\nHis rough deportment had gained him at the University (we are told\r\nby Wilkes) the appellation of the Butcher; and he took no pains to\r\nget rid of it. He was also called “the King of Barking,” his country\r\nresidence and principal patrimony being in that village, where he was\r\nmuch respected, and where he lies buried. He died in 1791. The late\r\nMarchioness of Salisbury was his granddaughter, and inherited his\r\nestates.--E.\r\n\r\n[151] Soon after, seeing another member give Barré a biscuit, Townshend\r\nsaid, “Oh! you should feed him with raw flesh.”\r\n\r\n[152] George Augustus Selwyn, of Matson, Gloucestershire, famous for\r\nhis wit.

He was for some time the tutor of\r\nGibbon.--E.\r\n\r\n[154] “Of this very alarming connection Mr. Pitt had the most early\r\nand authentic intelligence, together with the most positive assurances\r\nfrom persons of undoubted veracity, who are at this moment in no\r\ncommon sphere of life.” History of the Minority, p. 30. Mr. Adolphus\r\nstates the treaty itself to have been communicated to Mr. Pitt by the\r\nEarl Marechal Keith, in gratitude for the reversal of his attainder,\r\nbut “that the fact, if it existed, was not disclosed to the Cabinet,”\r\nAdolphus, vol. i. p. 44. This story receives some confirmation from\r\na cotemporary memoir of the Earl Marechal recently published by the\r\nSpalding Society of Aberdeen, and supposed to have been written by\r\nSir Robert Strange, who had once been a zealous Jacobite. Neither the\r\nChatham Correspondence nor the Mitchell manuscripts contain anything on\r\nthe subject; and the papers of the Earl Marechal, at Cumbernald, have\r\nnever been thoroughly examined. The Editor is disposed to believe the\r\nintelligence received by Mr. Pitt did not go so far as the existence\r\nof the treaty, but consisted of facts sufficient, in his estimation,\r\nto leave no doubt of the object of the negotiation between France\r\nand Spain, and of the general intentions of the Spanish government.\r\nThese facts he had imparted to Lord Bute, who had not drawn the same\r\nconclusions from them. Hist. of Minority, p. 33.--E.\r\n\r\n[155] Charles Pratt was a younger son of Lord Chief Justice Pratt, and\r\nbecame afterwards Lord Chancellor and Baron Camden, as will appear in\r\nthese memoirs. Pratt had been made Attorney-General by Pitt in 1757,\r\nand their connection was too close for the Government to feel easy at\r\nhis continuing any longer in office.--E.\r\n\r\n[156] He nevertheless made a favourable impression on the Duke of\r\nNewcastle, at their first interview; and at a later period we find him\r\nvery handsomely mentioned by Lord Rochford. Some of his private letters\r\nin the Chatham Correspondence, as well as his public dispatches in\r\nthe Parliamentary Papers, are those of an ambassador who understood\r\nhis duty, and performed it. He laboured hard, in conjunction with\r\nhis friend the Marquis of Grimaldi, to restore the old connection\r\nof his country with France; and one result of their success was,\r\nthe appointment of Grimaldi to succeed Wall as First Minister of\r\nSpain. Fuentes, then, for some time, replaced Grimaldi at Paris; and\r\nsubsequently returning to Spain, he employed all his influence, which\r\nwas considerable, in supporting Grimaldi’s administration, until the\r\nlatter imprudently allowed his son, the Prince of Pignatelli, to\r\naccompany the expedition to Algiers, under the Count O’Reily, in 1777,\r\nwhere the Prince perished; and Fuentes, who had refused his consent\r\nto his going, was so deeply offended, that he immediately joined the\r\nopposition to Grimaldi, and contributed essentially to his retirement\r\nfrom office. Coxe’s History of the Kings of Spain of the House of\r\nBourbon, vol. v.--E.\r\n\r\n[157] George William Hervey, Earl of Bristol, son of the famous John\r\nLord Hervey, and grandson of John Earl of Bristol, whom he succeeded in\r\nthe title. His dispatches prove him to have acted with great prudence\r\nas long as the disposition of the Spanish Court was doubtful and with\r\ngreat spirit afterwards. His connection with Mr. Pitt was in no degree\r\nof a servile character. It appears to have strengthened as that great\r\nminister was losing his ascendancy in the Cabinet, and it stood the\r\ntest of his downfall.

When it was proposed to allow monuments to be erected in St.\r\nPaul’s Cathedral, he violently opposed the plan, on the ground that, as\r\nthere had been no monuments in all the time before he was bishop, there\r\nshould be none in his time.

Warburton sneers\r\nat “his antiquarianism,” to which he was more exclusively devoted\r\nthan strictly became his high position in the Church. On the other\r\nhand, he was what Bishop Warburton certainly was not, a very amiable,\r\nkind-hearted man. In early life he had been a barrister.--George Selwyn\r\nand his Contemporaries, vol. i. p. 71.--E.\r\n\r\n[171] A greater military critic, General Jomini, was of a different\r\nopinion. He pronounces Broglio to be the only French commander of that\r\nday whose operations were uniformly skilful. He had fought in more\r\nbattles than perhaps any of his contemporaries. An authentic account\r\nof his life would still be of value, but his fame was eclipsed by the\r\nexploits of younger heroes, and he had even ceased to be an object of\r\ninterest when he died in exile at Munster, in 1804, at the advanced age\r\nof 86.--E.\r\n\r\n[172] The Count de Broglio’s talents were undeniable. It was his\r\nmisfortune, not less than his fault, that they were seldom well\r\ndirected. His brilliant defence of Cassel during the Seven years’ war\r\nshowed that he had no mean capacity for war; but his ambition was, to\r\nshine as a statesman, and, unhappily for him, the enmity of Choiseul\r\nexcluded him from civil employments. Partly, perhaps, out of revenge,\r\nand partly from his love of political intrigue, he condescended to take\r\ncharge of the secret correspondence which Louis the Fifteenth carried\r\non for many years, independently of his ministers, at the principal\r\nforeign Courts, a system which made it almost impossible for an\r\nhonourable man to serve the King with benefit.

One being\r\nforgotten (the last being of inferior merit to the other), he was\r\nlong known by the name of _Single-speech_. He came into Parliament\r\nin 1754; and after sitting silent for somewhat more than a year, at\r\nlength delivered that _single speech_ upon which his reputation has\r\nexclusively rested down to the present day. This speech, which we are\r\ntold was set and full of antitheses, was in favour of the Ministry,\r\nand was speedily rewarded by a place at the Board of Trade.--Edinburgh\r\nReview, vol. xv. p. 164. He had a promptitude of thought, and a rapid\r\nflow of well-conceived matter, with many other requisites that only\r\nseemed waiting for opportunities to establish his reputation as an\r\norator. These were set off by a striking countenance, a graceful\r\ncarriage, great self-possession, and personal courage.--Cumberland’s\r\nMemoirs, i. 225. With all these advantages he did not rise to eminence,\r\nnor did he deserve it, for his views were narrow, and he was selfish\r\nand cold-hearted. He resumed his silence upon attaining the lucrative\r\nand sinecure office of Chancellor of the Exchequer in Ireland, and\r\ndied in 1796, rich and unmarried. His “Parliamentary Logic” is an\r\ninsignificant work.--E.\r\n\r\n[183] Robert Monckton, brother of Lord Galway, a very gallant officer,\r\nwho signed the reddition of Quebec, and performed other memorable\r\nservices in that war.\r\n\r\n[184] Sir George Bridges Rodney, afterwards Lord Rodney, the great\r\nnaval commander.

He\r\nwas also an author, and wrote that excellent comedy, “The Heiress.”\r\n\r\n[186] Infidelity was then no uncommon charge against an unsuccessful\r\ncommander. The Prince had in 1752 been worsted at Breslau, where he had\r\nonly twenty-four thousand men to oppose to an army of ninety thousand,\r\nunder Daun and Prince Charles of Lorraine. In return, he defeated Daun\r\nin 1762 at Reichenbad, a victory that decided the fate of Schweidnitz,\r\nand thus contributed to the final success of Prince Henry of Prussia at\r\nFriedberg.--E.\r\n\r\n[187] Considering that Lord Tyrawley was in his 72nd year, and had not\r\nbeen employed on active service for a very long period, the Government\r\nsurely acted discreetly in not appointing him to this command. He died\r\nin 1773, in his 83rd year. His life had been singularly licentious,\r\neven for the Courts of Russia and Portugal, where, however, he\r\nacquired extraordinary influence, for he had a thorough knowledge\r\nof the world, a great deal of humour, and an undaunted spirit. See\r\nmore of him in Walpole’s Memoirs, vol. ii. p. 291; and Lord Chatham’s\r\nCorrespondence.--E.\r\n\r\n[188] This remarkable man was Sovereign of Lippe Buckebourgh, a petty\r\nstate, lying on the confines of Hanover and Westphalia. His mother was\r\ndaughter of George the First, by the Duchess of Kendal. He received\r\nthe early part of his education in England, and held a commission in\r\nthe Guards: at nineteen, he served at the battle of Dettingen; and\r\ntwo years after he showed signal intrepidity as a volunteer under\r\nPrince Lobkowitz, in Italy. At the outset of the Seven years’ war\r\nhe joined the Confederates with his small contingent, and bore a\r\nprominent part in the various military operations that ensued. His\r\nbravery, in common with his opinions, had a tinge of eccentricity, but\r\nthe boldness and originality of his mind were not ill directed. He\r\nbecame an enterprising and successful partisan, and an able commander\r\nof artillery; in which latter capacity he distinguished himself\r\nboth at Minden and at Kampen. Being intrusted with a separate corps\r\nfor the reduction of Munster, he not only captured the place, but\r\ndefeated General Armentières, who had been sent with a French army\r\nto its relief. It was in Portugal, however, that he established his\r\nreputation. “He found the army there,” says his biographer, “in a\r\nstate of thorough disorganization, without either food or pay; even\r\nthe guards at the Royal Palace implored alms from strangers, with\r\nbended knees and outstretched caps. The officers, impelled by want,\r\nfollowed various humble crafts. There were instances of the husband\r\nworking as a journeyman tailor, whilst his wife earned her subsistence\r\nas a washerwoman; and captains might be seen bringing baskets of linen\r\nfrom the wash. Many were servants in the households of generals and\r\ngovernors; indeed servants were sometimes presented with commissions\r\nin order that their pay might serve in lieu of wages.” All these\r\nabuses the Count, unsupported, if not opposed by the Court and the\r\nministers, succeeded in rectifying. With the assistance of the English,\r\nhe checked the progress of the Spanish troops, and defeated them in\r\nseveral encounters. He built the citadel of Elvas. He organized a\r\nplan for the defence of the kingdom; and at the end of the war he\r\nquitted Portugal, followed by the gratitude and attachment of the King\r\nand the people. Indeed, the House of Braganza were not under greater\r\nobligations to his illustrious predecessor, Marshal Schomberg. His\r\nreforms show considerable acuteness and knowledge of character, and\r\nwere completely successful. One of the most questionable was, that\r\nwhile he punished officers in Germany for accepting a challenge, he\r\npunished the Portuguese for refusing, with the view of restoring a\r\nmartial spirit among the troops. The remainder of his life he passed\r\nat Buckebourgh, the chief town of La Lippe, beloved by his subjects,\r\nand always employed in promoting their prosperity, though he has been\r\ncharged with sometimes mistaking himself for a great monarch, while he\r\nwas only a petty prince. He married in 1765 the Countess of La Lippe\r\nBustafeld, a young lady of great beauty and accomplishments, and had\r\none daughter, whose early death was quickly followed by that of the\r\nmother; and the Count, inconsolable under this double affliction, fell\r\ninto a lingering disorder, of which he died in 1777, at the age of\r\n53. He enjoyed the warm friendship of the King of Prussia, the Prince\r\nFerdinand of Brunswick, and other great commanders. They entertained a\r\nhigh opinion of his military capacity. He inspired a sort of enthusiasm\r\nin all around him. Even the Spanish officers, who used to ridicule\r\nhis reforms, and when they first descried him in the field, with his\r\nlarge hat and little sword, contemptuously asked whether the Portuguese\r\nwere commanded by Don Quixote, eventually partook of the general\r\nfeeling of admiration that attached to his generosity--his extreme\r\ndisinterestedness--his abilities and valour. Biographische Denkmale,\r\nvon K. Barnhagen von Ense.--E.\r\n\r\n[189] Doctor Johnson, in the newspapers of the day, published an\r\naccount of this inquiry. His weakness consisted in so far giving\r\nconfidence to this flimsy imposture, as to think a solemn inquiry\r\nnecessary. Croker’s Boswell, vol. i. p. 415, note.--E.\r\n\r\n[190] Though so notorious at the time, we have been able to find only\r\none pamphlet on the subject in the British Museum, and the papers\r\nseem to have been very reluctant to give the names of the parties.\r\nJuly 10, 1762, William Parsons, Elizabeth his wife, Mary Fraser, the\r\nGhost’s interpreter, a clergyman, and a respectable tradesman, were\r\ntried at Guildhall, and convicted of a conspiracy to defame a Mr. Kent.\r\nIn the Annual Register it is said, “The Court chusing that Mr. Kent,\r\nwho had been so much injured on the occasion, should receive some\r\nreparation by punishment of the offenders, deferred giving judgment\r\nfor seven or eight months, _in hopes that the parties might make it\r\nup in the meantime_. Accordingly, the clergyman and tradesman agreed\r\nto pay Mr. Kent a round sum--some say between 500_l._ and 600_l._--to\r\npurchase their pardon, and were, therefore, dismissed with a severe\r\nreprimand. The father was ordered to be set in the pillory three times\r\nin one month--once at the end of Cock Lane; Elizabeth his wife to be\r\nimprisoned one year; and Mary Fraser six months in Bridewell, with\r\nhard labour. The father appearing to be out of his mind at the time he\r\nwas first to stand in the pillory, the execution of that part of his\r\nsentence was deferred to another day, when, as well as the other day\r\nof his standing there, the populace took so much compassion on him,\r\nthat instead of using him ill, they made a handsome subscription for\r\nhim.”--_v._ Annual Register, vol. cxlii. and Gentleman’s Magazine,\r\n1762, pp. 43 and 339. The liberty to speak to the prosecutor, described\r\nabove as sanctioned by Lord Mansfield, would not now be so openly\r\npermitted, even by a bench of Middlesex Magistrates. Churchill’s poem\r\nmentions “the Ghost,” only as a peg to hang a satire upon. It has much\r\nvigour, but a key is wanted, and probably nobody can supply one to the\r\nallusions, or even the regularly drawn characters of the greater part:\r\nJohnson, Warburton, Mansfield, and one or two more are apparent. “The\r\nGhost” has also furnished the very clever scene of the trial of Fanny\r\nthe Phantom, in Foote’s farce of “The Orators.”--E.\r\n\r\n[191] Dr. Thomas Secker.\r\n\r\n[192] Prospero Lambertini, one of the most learned, enlightened, and\r\nvirtuous prelates that ever filled the Papal chair.

Though a man of quality, he had been a monk, and the world and\r\nthe cloister had united to make him an accomplished statesman. He\r\neventually rose to be first minister of Sardinia. His main fault was\r\nthat he used too much finesse and precaution, and attached too great\r\nimportance to trifles. Some amusing anecdotes of him are told in\r\nMemoirs of a Traveller now in Retirement, vol. ii. p. 63.--E.\r\n\r\n[204] The Bailli de Solar had been the Sardinian Ambassador at Rome, at\r\nthe same time that the Duc de Choiseul was the French Ambassador there,\r\nand a warm friendship had existed between them from that period.--E.\r\n\r\n[205] The communication made by Lord Bute to the Court of Vienna,\r\nappears to have originated in the belief that the Austrians were, on\r\nnational grounds, more inclined to peace than any of the other powers.\r\nConsidering the close connection existing between the Courts of Vienna\r\nand Paris, and the certainty that such a step would be viewed in the\r\nworst light by the King of Prussia, it must be regarded as a blunder.\r\nThe correspondence that passed on the occasion is printed in the\r\nAppendix to Adolphus, vol. i. p. 578.

He claimed a\r\ndescent from the ancient Barons d’Amorie; but his wife’s genealogy, and\r\nhis own wealth, of which the origin had certainly nothing distinguished\r\nin it, were the more probable causes of his elevation.--Banks, vol.\r\niii. p. 516.

He\r\nhad been Minister at Turin from 1758 to 1762, when he was appointed\r\nto Venice; but, before he could leave Turin, the death of the Duke\r\nof Argyle caused Lord Bute to bring him home abruptly to take\r\nthe direction of the Government in Scotland; an exercise of the\r\nFavourite’s power, which proved him to be virtually at the head of\r\nthe Administration. From the same feelings of exclusiveness, Lord\r\nBute subsequently selected Mr. Mackenzie, in preference to any of his\r\ncolleagues in the Cabinet, to assist him in the early part of the\r\nnegotiations for peace. Whatever points were settled by his Lordship\r\nwith the King, were then communicated, through Mr. Mackenzie, to the\r\nCount de Virri, by whom they were transmitted, through the Bailli de\r\nSolar, to the Duke of Choiseul, and it was only after an article had\r\nbeen actually agreed upon that it came officially under the cognizance\r\nof the Foreign Department; so that these two foreigners appear to have\r\npossessed more of Lord Bute’s confidence, as well as more influence\r\nover the negotiation, than the Secretary of State, Lord Egremont; a\r\ncircumstance which rather explains the jealousy shown by the Cabinet,\r\nwhen the preliminaries had been settled, of any independent authority\r\nbeing given to the Duke of Bedford. These duties Mr. Mackenzie\r\ndischarged irreproachably, and, far from sharing his brother’s\r\nunpopularity, was much esteemed by all parties. He is described by his\r\nsecretary, M. Dutens, as having been most amiable, remarkably cheerful\r\nand pleasant in society, with very simple tastes, and no ambition;\r\n“well versed in the sciences, particularly in mathematics, algebra,\r\nand astronomy.” He took little part in public affairs after Lord\r\nBute’s resignation, and died in 1800, at the age of 81 years, only a\r\nfew months after the death of his wife, the daughter of John Duke of\r\nArgyle.

He was the second\r\nson of Felix Calvert of Furneaux Pelham Hall, but succeeded to the\r\nfamily property by the death of his elder brother. It is a pity that\r\nhis madness was not catching, for he was one of the most honest and\r\nindependent members in the House, an eminent agriculturist, and an\r\nactive county magistrate. In politics he was “a Whig, and something\r\nmore.” He died without issue in 1793.--E.\r\n\r\n[220] This speech “is said to have silenced all future attacks by the\r\npoet either on Mr. Pitt or his administration, and was well received on\r\nall sides.”--Hansard’s Par.

Young, of Norwich, was out of town, but adhered\r\nfaithfully to Newcastle.\r\n\r\n[226] Sir Francis Dashwood’s want of knowledge of finance opened a fine\r\nfield for the wits of the day, and was of course greatly exaggerated.\r\nOne of them describes him as “a man to whom a sum of five figures\r\nwas an impenetrable secret.” His vocation, certainly, was not to\r\nthe Exchequer; and he was unfortunate in having Mr. Legge for his\r\npredecessor. There were other high offices of the Government which he\r\nwould have filled with credit, for he had respectable talents, was\r\n“spirited, frank, and manly,” and had gained the consideration of\r\nthe House. (Smollet.) He was the only son of Sir Francis Dashwood,\r\nBaronet, M.P. for Winchelsea, by Lady Mary Fane, sister of the Earl of\r\nWestmoreland, often mentioned in these Memoirs. In his youth he had\r\ntravelled much, especially in Italy, and passed some time at Rome,\r\nwhere he was long recollected from the following anecdote, which made\r\na great noise at the time. “It was on Good Friday, when each person\r\nwho attends the service in the Sistine Chapel, as he enters, takes\r\na small scourge from an attendant at the door. The chapel is dimly\r\nlighted, and there are three candles which are extinguished by the\r\npriest, one by one: at the putting out of the first, the penitents\r\ntake off one part of their dress; at the next still more; and, in the\r\ndarkness which follows the extinguishing of the third candle, lay\r\non their own shoulders, with groans and lamentations. Sir Francis\r\nDashwood, thinking this mere stage effect, entered with others,\r\ndressed in a large watchman’s coat; demurely took his scourge from\r\nthe priest, and advanced to the end of the chapel; where, on the\r\ndarkness ensuing, he drew from beneath his coat an English horsewhip\r\nand flogged right and left quite down the chapel and made his escape,\r\nthe congregation exclaiming ‘Il diavolo! il diavolo!’ and thinking\r\nthe Evil one was upon them with a vengeance! The consequence of this\r\nfrolic might have been serious to him, had he not immediately fled the\r\nPapal dominions.”--(Private Information.) His political life was by no\r\nmeans discreditable; and, in the unfortunate affair of Admiral Byng, he\r\nexhibited kindness of feeling not less than tact and decision, which\r\nWalpole has elsewhere handsomely noticed.--Memoirs, ii. p. 145. He had\r\na taste for the arts, and brought sculptors and painters from Italy to\r\ndecorate his country-seat at West Wycombe, in Buckinghamshire, where he\r\nlaid out an extensive park with skill and effect, and built a church\r\nand mausoleum. His private life was reported to be very licentious.\r\nHe married the widow of Sir Richard Ellys, Baronet, by whom he had\r\nno children, and died in 1781. The peerage, to which his claim is\r\nmentioned in a following page, descended to the Stapylton family.--E.\r\n\r\n[227] They called themselves the Dilettanti. In the year 1770, they\r\npublished a pompous volume on some rubbish remaining of two or three\r\ntemples in Ionia.\r\n\r\n[228] William Henry, third son of Frederick Prince of Wales; afterwards\r\nDuke of Gloucester.\r\n\r\n[229] Lord Bute held his levées at the Cockpit, Whitehall, as did\r\nafterwards the Duke of Grafton and Lord North. Till then, each minister\r\nsaw company at his own house; but Lord Bute, who lived in a small house\r\nin Audley Street, Grosvenor Square, had not room enough.\r\n\r\n[230] Mr., afterwards Sir Gilbert, Elliot, father of the late Earl of\r\nMinto. His connection with Lord Bute does credit to that nobleman’s\r\ndiscernment, for he was a most useful coadjutor; and Professor Stewart\r\nsays of him, that he “seems to have united with his other well-known\r\ntalents and accomplishments, a taste for abstract disquisitions which\r\nrarely occurs in men of the world, accompanied with that soundness and\r\ntemperance of judgment which in such researches are so indispensably\r\nnecessary to guard the mind against the illusions engendered by its own\r\nsubtility.”--Philosophy of the Human Mind, vol. ii. p. 530.--E.\r\n\r\n[231] Dr. Smollet, originally a ship-surgeon, was an abusive Jacobite\r\nwriter, author of a compilation of the History of England, in which he\r\nhad spoken most scurrilously of the Duke of Cumberland for suppressing\r\nthe Rebellion, and had been punished by the King’s Bench for slandering\r\nAdmiral Knowles. [His “genius,” however, to use the words of Walter\r\nScott, “has raised an imperishable monument to his memory,” in the\r\npoems and novels which Walpole does not deign to notice in this\r\nallusion to his works. Nor is the criticism just in other respects.\r\nSmollet’s tracts are not more virulent than most publications of a\r\nsimilar character of that day. His censure of the Duke of Cumberland\r\nhas been confirmed by subsequent historians, and his punishment for\r\nthe libel on Admiral Knowles reflects discredit on the Admiral rather\r\nthan on himself.--See Walter Scott’s Lives of the Novelists, vol. i. p.\r\n143.--E.]\r\n\r\n[232] Murphy, once an actor, was turned hackney writer, and had engaged\r\nin a paper called _the Contest_, in behalf of Lord Holland. He stole\r\nmany plays from the French, and published other things long since\r\nforgotten. [“The Way to keep Him,” and “All in the Wrong,” are alone a\r\nsufficient refutation of the above harsh criticism on Murphy. He was a\r\nperson of considerable accomplishments, and wanted only a better temper\r\nand more independence of character to have risen to eminence. He died\r\nat an advanced age in 1805.--E.]\r\n\r\nSmollet and Murphy, with Dr. Shebbeare, who was in Newgate for abusing\r\nKing George the First, King George the Second, King William, and the\r\nRevolution, and Dr. Johnson, another known Jacobite, who even in a\r\nDictionary had vented his Jacobite principles, were selected by Lord\r\nBute to defend his cause, and pensioned by him as a patron of learned\r\nmen. Johnson’s acceptance of a pension was the more ridiculous, as in\r\nhis Dictionary he had lashed the infamy of pensioners. [Neither Smollet\r\nnor Murphy were pensioned by Lord Bute. The bounty of the Crown was\r\nnever more inexcusably exercised than in favour of Dr. Shebbeare--a\r\npamphleteer who was a disgrace to his party, and had not long before\r\nbeen concerned in some fraudulent practices at Oxford, when employed\r\nby the University to arrange the Clarendon papers. He died in 1788, at\r\na very advanced age. Dr. Johnson’s pension was not subjected to any\r\nconditions.--Boswell, vol. i. p. 292.--E.]\r\n\r\n[233] His father was a distiller.\r\n\r\n[234] Mr. Southey, opposed as he was to the political creed of\r\nChurchill, thought more favourably of him. He praises the generosity\r\nand straightforwardness of his character, and says of his poems\r\nthat “manly sense is their characteristic, deriving strength from\r\nindignation, and that they contain passages of sound morality and\r\npermanent truth.” Cowper had a higher opinion of him than of any other\r\ncontemporary writer, and even goes so far as to style him “the great\r\nChurchill.”--Southey’s Cowper, p. 87.--E.\r\n\r\n[235] Groom of the Bedchamber to William Duke of Cumberland, and\r\nCommander in America. He was afterwards Knight of the Bath, and\r\ncalled Sir Joseph Amherst. He was subsequently made a Peer and\r\nCommander-in-Chief, [and lastly Field-Marshal. He had been the\r\nfavourite aide-de-camp of Lord Ligonier during the German wars, and\r\nbore through life the reputation of a very able and zealous officer. He\r\ndistinguished himself particularly in America. He died in 1797, in his\r\neighty-first year.--E.]\r\n\r\n[236] Alluding to the defeat of the French near Giessau, by Prince\r\nFerdinand, on the 26th September, when he drove them from all\r\ntheir posts, and obliged them to fly with precipitation behind the\r\nNahn.--Annual Register, 1762, p. 49.--E.\r\n\r\n[237] This narrative of the dethronement of Peter the Third has\r\nbeen confirmed in many essential points by later writers.--Tooke’s\r\nCatherine the Second.--Castera.--Levesque, Hist. de Russie, vol.\r\nv. 298. The precise extent of the guilt of the Empress is still a\r\nsubject of dispute. The dethronement of her husband might be an act of\r\nself-defence, for he seems to have contemplated raising his mistress\r\nto the throne. His murder certainly had her ready forgiveness, if not\r\nher acquiescence, and there is nothing in her character to controvert\r\nits having been committed at her instigation. The attempt to exculpate\r\nher in the recently published Memoirs of the Princess Dashkau is very\r\nfar from satisfactory, though it in some degree elevates the character\r\nof the authoress above the level of her contemporaries at the Court\r\nof St. Petersburgh, a court in those days without a parallel for the\r\nprevalence of the crimes and vices of a semi-barbarous age.--E.\r\n\r\n[238] George third Earl, Augustus, and William, sons of William Anne\r\nsecond Earl of Albemarle. Frederick, the fourth son, was on this\r\noccasion promoted to the Bishoprick of Exeter. Of Augustus (afterwards\r\nLord Keppel) see more in the preceding reign, under the History of\r\nAdmiral Byng.--Memoirs, vol. ii. p. 174. [A very interesting account\r\nof his life was lately published by his kinsman, the Honourable and\r\nReverend Thomas Augustus Keppel.--E.]\r\n\r\n[239] Madame Geoffrin was proprietor of a great manufacture of glass;\r\nyet by her wit, parts, riches, and cabals, and by patronizing authors,\r\nand the modern philosophers and painters, statuaries and architects,\r\nand by keeping an open house for foreigners of all nations, she was\r\nmuch considered, and had great respect paid to her by persons of the\r\nfirst rank in France. [Marmontel draws a spirited portrait of her in\r\nhis Memoirs.--E.]\r\n\r\n[240] This is a very one-sided view of the character of the Duc de\r\nNivernois. He had no pretensions to the character of a soldier, having\r\nbeen obliged to quit the army from ill-health at an early age. As a\r\ndiplomatist, he certainly failed at Berlin--as all other diplomatists\r\ndid, who brought proposals that did not suit the views of the King\r\nof Prussia. In England he gave great satisfaction to all parties.\r\nHis popularity is noticed by Lord Chesterfield. He was a generous,\r\nthough not perhaps a very discriminating, patron of letters, and a\r\nrespectable writer for one who made literature only an amusement. His\r\nprivate life was exemplary; and he showed no common strength of mind\r\nin the firmness with which he bore the loss of his rank and property,\r\nand, above all, his heavy domestic misfortunes. His second wife, to\r\nwhom he was tenderly attached, died a few days after marriage. Of his\r\ntwo sons-in-law, the Count de Gisors, his destined heir, an élève of\r\nMarmontel, fell at the battle of Crevelt: the remaining one, the Duc de\r\nBrissac, was torn to pieces by the mob at Paris, at the beginning of\r\nthe Revolution. The Duke of Nivernois died in 1798, at a very advanced\r\nage.--E.\r\n\r\n[241] Besides his crime of being the favourite of the Duke of\r\nCumberland, Fox had deeply offended the Princess by advising Mr.\r\nPelham, the very day after the death of her husband, to take her son,\r\nthe present King, from her, that she might not get an ascendant over\r\nhim. I one day mentioned this fact to Lord Mansfield: he said, “It was\r\nvery true, and he believed the measure was not followed, _only_ because\r\nMr. Fox had advised it”--so jealous was Mr. Pelham of Fox!\r\n\r\n[242] James Earl Waldegrave, Governor to George the Third when Prince.\r\n\r\n[243] William Cavendish, fourth Duke of Devonshire, Lord Chamberlain.\r\n\r\n[244] Many causes might be assigned for the Duke’s dissatisfaction. It\r\nis not improbable that a generous Prince might resent the indignity\r\noffered to his country. He might, too, resent the unrelenting hatred\r\nof the Princess, and his total exclusion from power. He might feel for\r\nGermany, his other country, which he saw neglected: or he might have\r\nhoped that the aversion of the Princess to the House of Brunswick would\r\nnot cease without disgusting Prince Ferdinand; and that then, if the\r\nwar had continued, the command would have once more devolved on himself.\r\n\r\n[245] Samuel Martin, a West Indian, had been in the service of the\r\nlate Prince of Wales. See more of him hereafter, and in Churchill’s\r\n“Duellist.” [He had been brought into the Treasury by Mr. Legge\r\nwhen the latter was made Chancellor of the Exchequer. Sir George\r\nColebrooke’s MS. Memoirs represent him as a plain-spoken, honest man,\r\nand more to be depended upon than his joint secretary Mr. West.--E.]\r\n\r\n[246] Richard Aldworth Neville, of Billingbere, Berkshire, [son of Mr.\r\nAldworth of Stanlake, by Catherine sister of Mr. Henry Neville Grey of\r\nBillingbere, whose estate he subsequently inherited. He filled for some\r\nyears the office of Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, which\r\noccasioned his being employed at Paris; and he represented Wallingford,\r\nReading, and Tavistock in different Parliaments. The Barony of\r\nBraybrooke descended on his only son (the late Lord) by a special\r\nlimitation in the patent obtained by his relative, Sir John Griffin,\r\nLord Howard de Walden, whose large estates he also inherited.--History\r\nof Audley End, p. 54.--E.]\r\n\r\n[247] This statement rests on Walpole’s unsupported testimony. The\r\nfacts that I have been able to collect on the subject, in the quarters\r\nlikely to be the best informed, are these:--On the 7th of September\r\nLord Egremont wrote to the Duke of Bedford, informing him of the King’s\r\ncommands that he should not sign the preliminaries without first\r\nsending them over for his Majesty’s approbation. On the 18th the Duke\r\nwrote to M. de Choiseul that he was ready to sign, and that he only\r\n_waits his answer to send his messenger to London_. On the 28th or\r\n29th Lord Egremont wrote by the French courier of M. de Nivernois that\r\nthe Havannah was taken. On the 30th he repeats the news, and promises\r\nfresh instructions. The Duke never pretended to sign against the King’s\r\norders, though he complained of their tenor. Thus Walpole’s story\r\nbecomes very improbable.--E.\r\n\r\n[248] William Ponsonby, Earl of Besborough, one of the\r\nPostmasters-General, had married Lady Caroline Cavendish, eldest sister\r\nof the Duke of Devonshire.\r\n\r\n[249] Mr. Fox did _not_ go to Devonshire House to “protest his utter\r\nignorance of any such design.” He wrote to the Duke at Chatsworth on\r\nthe 2nd of November, to express his sorrow at what had happened; and in\r\na subsequent letter of the 9th assured his Grace that “he neither knew\r\nnor had the least suspicion” of the intention to strike his Grace’s\r\nname out of the Privy Council.--_Note by the late Mr. Allen_, on the\r\nmanuscript copy of these Memoirs.\r\n\r\n[250] Turned out for his opposition to the Excise Scheme in 1733.\r\n\r\n[251] Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, Prime Minister to Queen Anne.\r\n\r\n[252] William Keith, Earl Marichal, engaged in the rebellion of 1715.\r\nWhen he came out of the King’s closet, and was asked what the King had\r\nsaid, he replied in the words of the old ballad,\r\n\r\n   “The King looked over his left shoulder,\r\n      And a grim look looked he,\r\n    And cried ‘Earl Marshal, but for my oath,\r\n      Or hanged thou should’st be.’”\r\n\r\nLord Marichal was afterwards in the service of the King of Prussia, and\r\nGovernor of Neufchatel. He was pardoned by King George the Third. He\r\nis one of the few persons whom Frederick appears to have really loved.\r\nHe was a philosopher after the fashion of that monarch, but a more\r\npractical and amiable one; for he bore the loss of rank and wealth,\r\nand the various discomforts of a long and almost hopeless exile, with\r\nunostentatious cheerfulness, conducting himself all the while so\r\nprudently, that amidst his many political opponents he had not a single\r\npersonal enemy. The general esteem that followed him through life\r\nafterwards attached to his memory; and his name is rarely to be found\r\nmentioned in the works of his contemporaries without some expressions\r\nshowing an earnest desire to represent him in the fairest colours.\r\nD’Alembert wrote an _éloge_ in his honour. His brother, Marshal Keith,\r\nwas a man of far superior ability, and his exile was a serious loss\r\nto the British army. Lord Marichal died at Potsdam in 1778, in his\r\neighty-sixth year.--Wood’s Peerage of Scotland.--E.\r\n\r\n[253] The disgrace of the Duke of Devonshire.\r\n\r\n[254] John Montagu, Earl of Sandwich.

He\r\nhad, in the preceding reign, held with credit, at different times,\r\nthe offices of a Lord of the Treasury, of Paymaster, Chancellor of\r\nthe Duchy of Lancaster, &c., and was a frequent and useful speaker\r\nin the House of Commons, “where,” says Walpole, “he aimed at nothing\r\nbut understanding business and explaining it.” The Duke of Newcastle\r\nchiefly relied upon him in the distribution of the secret service-money\r\nand the Government patronage among the members. His embassy to Lisbon\r\nis remembered by the satirical verse of Pope,\r\n\r\n    “Kinnoul’s lewd cargo and Tyrawley’s crew.”\r\n\r\nHe took very little part in public affairs afterwards; residing usually\r\non his estates in Scotland, and devoting himself to rural improvements\r\nand matters of local interest. He died in 1787, aged 77, without issue,\r\nand was succeeded by his nephew.--E.\r\n\r\n[260] Henry Clinton, Earl of Lincoln, Knight of the Garter, and one of\r\nthe Lords of the Bedchamber, was son of Henry Earl of Lincoln and Lucy\r\nPelham, sister of the Duke of Newcastle and Henry Pelham, First Lord of\r\nthe Treasury; and having married his first-cousin, Catherine, eldest\r\ndaughter and co-heiress of Mr. Pelham, the Duke’s estate, and a new\r\ncreation of the Duchy of Newcastle in reversion, were settled on him.\r\n(He died in 1794, and was the grandfather of the present Duke.)--E.\r\n\r\n[261] “This honest old General,” as he is called by Lord Chesterfield,\r\nowed his high rank entirely to his own merit, being a French Huguenot,\r\nof not distinguished parentage, and without connections in this\r\ncountry. He was a very brave, zealous, and intelligent officer. He had\r\nserved with Marlborough in the German wars, and his conduct afterwards\r\nat Dettingen attracted the particular notice of George the Second,\r\nwho invested him with the insignia of the Bath on the field, in front\r\nof the whole army. As an additional mark of the King’s favour, he was\r\nalso raised to a high command in Flanders, from which time all the\r\nskill shown in the Duke of Cumberland’s military operations,--which at\r\nFontenoy was not inconsiderable, for the battle was only lost by the\r\nmisconduct of General Ingoldsby,--the army ascribed exclusively to him,\r\nhis Royal Highness being believed to act in a great measure under his\r\nguidance: and, indeed, he was usually called the Duke’s military tutor.\r\nIn the Duke’s absence during the Scotch rebellion of 1745, he succeeded\r\nto the command of the British troops in Flanders, and was present with\r\nten battalions in the unfortunate battle of Raucoux, where he almost\r\nretrieved the errors of Prince Charles of Lorraine, and is admitted to\r\nhave saved the army from total destruction. The brilliant charges of\r\ncavalry by which he protected the retreat of the allies have obtained\r\nthe praise even of the French historians. (Coxe’s Pelham, vol. i. p.\r\n322; Lacratelle, vol. ii. p. 350.) The Duke returned in the following\r\nyear, as if only to lose the battle of Lafeldt; on which occasion Sir\r\nJohn Ligonier reaped the same melancholy glory that had attended him\r\nat Raucoux. At seventy years of age, he led a charge of cavalry that\r\nbroke the enemy’s line, and had he not been taken prisoner, might have\r\nturned the fortune of the day. Louis the Fifteenth received him with\r\ndistinction; and, though a rebellious subject, made him the bearer\r\nof the overtures of the peace, which, on the following year, was\r\nconcluded at Aix-la-Chapelle. The remainder of his life was passed in\r\nless active service, and in the enjoyment of the rank and honours he\r\nhad so well earned. In 1757 he was made Commander-in-chief; in 1759,\r\nField-Marshal; in 1766, after passing through the subordinate steps\r\nin the peerage, he was created Earl Ligonier. He retained to the last\r\nthe gaiety and amiability which had made him the favourite both of the\r\narmy and the Court. His tastes were simple; one of his chief amusements\r\nbeing the embellishment of his country-seat in Surrey, of which his\r\ngardens were the admiration of the neighbourhood. He died in 1770, aged\r\n92; and was succeeded in his title by his nephew, an estimable and\r\npopular nobleman, who had been Aide-de-camp to Prince Ferdinand at the\r\nbattle of Minden, and on whose death, without issue, the title became\r\nextinct.--E.\r\n\r\n[262] Welbore Ellis.

I offered to resign my seat, but would not give up the\r\nliberty of voting as I pleased.\r\n\r\n[266] As Usher of the Exchequer, I advanced a very large sum of money\r\nevery year to furnish the Treasury with paper, stationery wares, &c.,\r\nand to pay the workmen; so that, if the payments are kept back, I am a\r\nconsiderable sufferer.\r\n\r\n[267] The Rangership of St. James’s and Hyde Parks. This post was not\r\nworth two thousand two hundred pounds a year by itself, but with the\r\nBedchamber; as Lord Ashburnham had held it. Lord Orford was already\r\nLord of the Bedchamber; so, though I did not know it at that time, the\r\noffer was grossly fallacious. Fox, however, might be ignorant too of\r\nthis circumstance.\r\n\r\n[268] George Walpole, third Earl of Orford, grandson of Sir Robert\r\nWalpole. Not only his grandfather and father had left great debts, but\r\nhis own dissipation had involved him in many more.\r\n\r\n[269] He scarce ever had any thoughts about politics, but lived almost\r\nalways in the country and at Newmarket, wasting his time and fortune\r\nby carelessness, rather than in pleasures and expenses. With a most\r\nengaging figure and address, he profited of no one advantage to which\r\nhe was born; and, without any view of advantage to himself, disgusted\r\nevery friend he had by insensibility, and every friend he might have\r\nhad by insincerity.\r\n\r\n[270] Charles Boone, brought into Parliament by Lord Orford for\r\nCastlerising. Fox _had already_ sounded Lord Orford through Mr. Boone,\r\nbut without receiving any answer.\r\n\r\n[271] This alludes to my having projected a match for Lord Orford\r\nwith Miss Nicholl, an heiress worth one hundred and fifty thousand\r\npounds, whom Lord Orford would not marry; and in the course of which\r\nnegotiation I had a great quarrel with my uncle, old Horace Walpole,\r\nwho endeavoured, though trusted with her by me, to marry her to one\r\nof his own younger sons. This quarrel had made very great noise, and\r\nmany persons were engaged in it. The young lady afterwards married the\r\nMarquis of Caernarvon.\r\n\r\n[272] Mr. Fox had supported Mr. Sullivan at a borough in the West\r\nagainst Mr. T. Walpole; I forget whether it was Callington or\r\nAshburton. Lord Orford was heir to estates in both by his mother.\r\n\r\n[273] Mr. Boone had acquainted me with this, and Mr. Fox thought I did\r\nnot know it, but I chose to let him see I did.\r\n\r\n[274] Thomas Thynne, Viscount Weymouth, afterwards one of the\r\nSecretaries of State.\r\n\r\n[275] Sir John Probyn, K.B., Lord Carysfort of Ireland. His son and\r\nsuccessor was ambassador at St. Petersburgh at the beginning of the\r\npresent century.--E.\r\n\r\n[276] George Fermor, second Earl of Pomfret, brother-in-law to Earl\r\nGranville. He was clever, and a ready speaker; but so hot, headstrong,\r\nand injudicious, that his support was of very questionable benefit\r\nto his political friends. Vide an amusing anecdote of him in George\r\nSelwyn’s Correspondence, vol. i. p. 352.--E.\r\n\r\n[277] Mr. Harris did not enter Parliament until he had passed his\r\nfiftieth year, or he would probably have better supported in the House\r\nthe reputation he had acquired in society and literature. He was an\r\naccomplished and truly amiable man. He did not rise beyond subordinate\r\noffices in the Government, having been made Lord of the Admiralty in\r\n1762, Lord of the Treasury in 1763. The change of administration in\r\n1765 displaced him, but he was appointed Controller to the Queen in\r\n1774. He died in 1780, in his seventy-second year. An elegant account\r\nof his life is prefixed to the edition of his works by his son, the\r\nfirst Earl of Malmesbury.--E.\r\n\r\n[278] Son of the Marquis of Lothian. He had been aide-de-camp of the\r\nDuke at Fontenoy, where he was severely wounded, and commanded the\r\ncavalry at Culloden. He died in 1775, aged sixty-five.--E.\r\n\r\n[279] John Fitzwilliam, brother of the Viscount of that name.\r\n\r\n[280] If there was any hardship in this step, it consisted in these\r\ngentlemen not having received previous notice from Mr. Fox that he\r\nshould regard opposition to the vote in the light of such direct\r\nhostility to the Government as would be incompatible with the tenure of\r\noffice under it. Previously, there appears to have been no settled rule\r\nas to the claims of the Government on the support of members in office.\r\nMr. Pitt, when Paymaster, not only voted but frequently spoke against\r\nthe Government. It would now be considered very extraordinary in any\r\nmember of the administration, however subordinate, to vote against a\r\nGovernment measure without a previous intimation to the premier of his\r\nreadiness to resign.--E.\r\n\r\n[281] Fourth daughter of John Leveson, first Earl Gower, wife of\r\nGeneral John Waldegrave, who succeeded his brother in the Earldom of\r\nWaldegrave.\r\n\r\n[282] Giles Earle.\r\n\r\n[283] Eldest son of Thomas, one of the Tellers of the Exchequer, second\r\nson of Charles Viscount Townshend, Secretary of State to George I. and\r\nII.\r\n\r\n[284] Younger son of the Earl of Granard.\r\n\r\n[285] A sufficient reason against his original appointment, but a bad\r\none for his dismissal. Mr. Schutz was very rich, having succeeded by\r\nbequest to a large estate in Essex, from Sir J. Tyrrel.--E.\r\n\r\n[286] This certainly was a very harsh proceeding. No Lord Lieutenant\r\nhas since been dismissed without far more decided provocation.--E.\r\n\r\n[287] This character of Lord Granville is not one of the author’s\r\nhappiest efforts. He has, however, hit off some of the more salient\r\ntraits of that nobleman’s character with great cleverness in his\r\n“Correspondence.” Lord Mahon and Mr. Macaulay have subsequently gone\r\nover the same ground with brilliant success, but the following sketch\r\nby Lord Chesterfield, to which they are both indebted, is so full of\r\nlife and spirit, that the editor cannot refrain from inserting it.\r\n\r\n“He had great parts and a most uncommon share of learning for a man\r\nof quality. He was one of the best speakers in the House of Lords,\r\nboth in the declamatory and the argumentative way. He had a wonderful\r\nquickness and precision in seizing the stress of a question, which no\r\nart, no sophistry, could disguise in him. In business he was bold,\r\nenterprising, and overbearing. He had been bred up in high monarchical,\r\nthat is, tyrannical principles of government, which his ardent and\r\nimperious temper made him think were the only rational and practical\r\nones. He would have been a great first Minister in France, little\r\ninferior, perhaps, to Richelieu; in this government, which is yet free,\r\nhe was neither ill-natured nor vindictive, and had a great contempt for\r\nmoney--his ideas were all above it. In social life he was an agreeable,\r\ngood-humoured, and instructive companion, a great but interesting\r\ntalker.\r\n\r\n“He degraded himself by the vice of drinking, which, together with\r\na great stock of Greek and Latin, he had brought from Oxford, and\r\npractised ever afterwards. By his own industry he had made himself\r\nmaster of all the modern languages, and had acquired great knowledge\r\nof the law. His political knowledge of the interests of princes and\r\nof commerce was extensive, and his notions were just and great. His\r\ncharacter may be summed up in nice precision, great decision, and\r\noverbearing presumption.”--Chesterfield’s Miscell. Works, vol. iv. p.\r\n49.--E.\r\n\r\n[288] This persecution is inexcusable, and very unlike Mr. Fox, who was\r\na very good-humoured man.--E.\r\n\r\n[289] Son of Heneage Legge, one of the Barons of the Exchequer.\r\n\r\n[290] I shall give two instances of my assertions. Sir William Milner\r\nheld a place of about 2000_l._ a year in the Custom-house, the greater\r\nportion of which had been allotted to his wife’s aunt, Mrs. Poyntz,[a]\r\nas a jointure on the death of her husband, who had been governor to the\r\nDuke of Cumberland. This was now taken away, and bestowed by Lord Bute\r\non Mr. Poole, to make him amends for the ravage made on his family[b]\r\nin this new persecution; Lord Bute intending at the same time to\r\nreserve 600_l._ a year out of it for Mrs. Poyntz. Lord Spencer, who\r\nhad married her daughter, wrote to the King representing the case,\r\nand begging his protection for Mrs. Poyntz. The petition concluded\r\nwith telling the King that this application was made to _him_, because\r\nprobably his Majesty would hear of the grievance no other way. On this\r\nthe whole was stopped; but that Fox might bear all the odium, and Lord\r\nBute have all the merit, the latter sent a message by Lord Ancram to\r\nthe Duke of Cumberland,[c] to say, that if his Royal Highness would\r\ntake it as a favour, the King would continue the pension to Mrs.\r\nPoyntz; and it was accepted.\r\n\r\nThe other was the case of Mrs. Cavendish, widow of an Admiral of that\r\nname. She had for many years enjoyed a housekeeper’s place in one of\r\nthe offices, in lieu of a pension as an Admiral’s widow. Fox, hunting\r\nafter employments for his dependents and objects of vengeance for\r\nhimself, lighting on the name of a Cavendish, took away her place. The\r\nlady, of a respectable family, and sister of Mrs. Cartwright, Maid of\r\nHonour to the late Queen, sent the latter to Lady Suffolk,[d] from whom\r\nI heard this account, immediately to entreat by her means an audience\r\nof Lady Elizabeth Mackenzie.[e] Mrs. Cavendish herself, living in\r\ndevotion and unknown _to_, proved to be a relation _of_ Lady Bute;\r\nto whom Lady E. Mackenzie had instantly applied. Lady Bute, no less\r\nsurprised, sent for her lord up stairs. He said the story could not be\r\ntrue: it was one Mrs. Greening that was displaced, to make room for\r\nMrs. Goldsworthy, a companion of the late Duchess of Richmond.[f] It\r\nproved that Fox had thus imposed on Lord Bute, to whom the name of Mrs.\r\nCavendish had never been mentioned, and who gave her immediate redress.\r\n\r\n  [a] Anna Maria Mordaunt, Maid of Honour to Queen Caroline, and widow\r\n      of Stephen Poyntz. She had been a great beauty; the poem of “The\r\n      Fair Circassian” was written by a gentleman who was in love with\r\n      her.\r\n\r\n  [b] Sir Francis Poole, related to the Duke of Newcastle, had been\r\n      turned out, with others of the same connection.\r\n\r\n  [c] Eldest son of the Marquis of Lothian, and groom of the bedchamber\r\n      to the duke.\r\n\r\n  [d] Henrietta Hobart, Countess of Suffolk, Mistress of the Robes to\r\n      Queen Caroline.\r\n\r\n  [e] Wife of James Stuart Mackenzie, brother of the Earl of Bute.\r\n\r\n  [f] Sarah Cadogan, Duchess of Richmond, mother of Lady Caroline Fox.\r\n\r\n[291] The same charge is brought against Sir Fletcher Norton by Junius\r\n(Letter 39), who applies to him the lines of Ben Jonson, describing the\r\nlawyer who\r\n\r\n    Gives forked counsel; takes provoking gold\r\n    _On either hand_, and puts it up;\r\n    So wise, so grave, of so perplexed a tongue,\r\n    And _loud_ withal, that would not wag, nor scarce\r\n    Lie still, _without a fee_.\r\n\r\nThough Norton had the character at the bar of being the reverse of a\r\nliberal practitioner, it is very improbable that Walpole’s assertion,\r\n“that he took money from both parties” in a suit, should be literally\r\ncorrect. He had too many rivals as well as enemies in the profession,\r\nto admit of such conduct remaining unpunished; but it is not uncommon\r\nfor a counsel to feel himself bound _in honour_ to refuse a brief which\r\nhe could not accept without using knowledge acquired while employed by\r\nparties who had a different interest, until he has given those parties\r\nthe option of employing him again; and Norton’s eagerness for gain made\r\nhim take a very narrow view of such questions.--E.\r\n\r\n[292] Only son of the Earl of Derby, and Chancellor of the Duchy of\r\nLancaster.\r\n\r\n[293] William Aislabie, auditor of the imprest, son of Mr. Aislabie,\r\nwho was concerned in the South-Sea scheme in the reign of George I.\r\n\r\n[294] The Report of the Committee is given in the Parliamentary\r\nDebates, vol. xv. 1286.

Envoy in\r\nEngland, and by the Bailli de Solar, the Sardinian Minister at Paris,\r\nthe intimate friend of the Duchess de Choiseul; and that convenience\r\nwas probably a reason why Lord Bute yielded to the treaty being\r\nsettled at Paris, though the King of France had offered to treat here\r\n_vis-à-vis du Roi de la Grande Brétagne_. [_Vide_ notes in p. 157 and\r\n160, _supra_, for more details respecting the part taken by these\r\nSardinian Ministers in the negotiation.--E.]\r\n\r\n[333] These Memoirs were published in 1821, with a very able\r\nintroduction by the late Lord Holland. A critic, who cannot be\r\nsuspected of partiality (Quarterly Review, vol. xxv. p. 413),\r\npronounces them “a model of this species of writing.” It is to be\r\nregretted that they embrace only four years, and those not the most\r\ninteresting, of the reign of George II. Lord Waldegrave possessed\r\nsound sense and respectable abilities. He was highly esteemed by his\r\ncontemporaries, and few men have passed through life, and, above all,\r\npublic life, with a character so entirely unblemished.--A masterly\r\ncritique of Lord Waldegrave’s Memoirs is given in the seventy-third\r\nnumber of the Edinburgh Review, from the pen of the late Mr. John\r\nAllen.--E.\r\n\r\n[334] George Grenville, next brother of Richard Earl Temple. He married\r\nElizabeth, daughter of Sir William Windham, and sister of Charles Earl\r\nof Egremont, and of Percy Windham Obrien, Earl of Thomond.\r\n\r\n[335] Treasurer of the Navy.\r\n\r\n[336] Sir Charles Windham, Earl of Egremont, eldest son of the\r\ncelebrated orator, Sir William Windham, Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\nin the four last years of Queen Anne, and of Lady Catherine Seymour,\r\ndaughter of Charles Duke of Somerset, the proudest man of his age.\r\n\r\n[337] Had Lord Egremont been a liar of the “monstrous magnitude”\r\nstated in the text, he certainly would never have had the opportunity\r\nof refusing the offer of being Secretary of State from a man of such\r\nstrict honour and integrity as Lord Waldegrave; an offer, be it\r\nobserved, which Walpole notices in his Memoirs of George the Second\r\nwithout censure. It was to his refusal of that offer, and to his\r\nsubsequent connection with Mr. Grenville, that Lord Egremont owed this\r\nsevere imputation. He was proud, obstinate, and hot-tempered; but\r\nthat he was not without talent is proved by his answer to the Spanish\r\nmemorial, a State paper of acknowledged merit. Bishop Newton, who\r\nknew him well, says, “that if he had entered earlier into business,\r\nhe might have made as considerable a figure as his father had. He had\r\nseldom occasion to speak in Parliament, but, when he did, it was with\r\ngreat clearness, force, and energy; and he was thought to resemble his\r\nfather in manner as well as in good matter, having a little catch and\r\nimpediment in his voice, as his father had.”--Newton’s Mem. p. 89.--E.\r\n\r\n[338] Many interesting anecdotes of Lord Halifax are given in the\r\nMemoirs of Mr. Cumberland, who had been his private secretary for many\r\nyears. He describes him thus: “I am persuaded he was formed to be a\r\ngood man, he might also have been a great one: his mind was large, his\r\nspirit active, his ambition honourable; he had a carriage noble and\r\nimposing; his first approach attracted notice; his consequent address\r\nensured respect. If his talents were not quite so solid as some, nor\r\naltogether so deep as others, yet they were brilliant, popular, and\r\nmade to glitter in the eyes of men: splendour was his passion; his\r\ngood-fortune threw opportunities in his way to have supported it; his\r\nill-fortune blasted all those energies which should have been reserved\r\nfor the crisis of his public fame. The first offices of the State,\r\nthe highest honours which his Sovereign could bestow, were showered\r\nupon him when the spring of his mind was broken; and his genius, like\r\na vessel overloaded with treasure, but far gone in decay, was only\r\nprecipitated to ruin by the very freight that, in its better days,\r\nwould have crowned it with prosperity and riches.” Vol. i. p. 242.\r\nThis is a generous portrait, considering that Cumberland had certainly\r\nbeen unkindly treated by Lord Halifax; and, had he always felt thus,\r\nhe would not have furnished Sheridan with the model of Sir Fretful\r\nPlagiary.--E.\r\n\r\n[339] The figures 45 became the hieroglyphics of Wilkes’s party.\r\n\r\n[340] Queen Anne’s speech on the treaty of Utrecht told a similar lie;\r\nso exactly was the parallel maintained throughout. [It was consequently\r\nmade one of the subjects of Lord Orford’s impeachment. Vide fifteenth\r\nArticle, Journals, vol. xviii. p. 214.--E.]\r\n\r\n[341] The following passages are those to which the text refers: “This\r\nweek has given the public the most abandoned instance of official\r\neffrontery ever attempted to be imposed on mankind. The minister’s\r\nspeech last Tuesday is not to be paralleled in the annals of this\r\ncountry. I am in doubt whether the imposition is greater on the\r\nSovereign or on the nation. Every friend of his country must lament\r\nthat a Prince of so many great and amiable qualities, whom England\r\ntruly reveres, can be brought to give the sanction of his name to the\r\nmost odious measures, and to the most unjustifiable public doctrines,\r\nfrom a Throne ever renowned for truth, honour, and unsullied virtue. I\r\nam sure all foreigners, especially the King of Prussia, will hold the\r\nminister in contempt and abhorrence. He has made our Sovereign declare,\r\n‘_My expectations have been fully answered by the happy effects which\r\nthe several allies of my crown have derived from the salutary measure\r\nof the definitive treaty. The powers at war with my good brother\r\nthe King of Prussia have been induced to agree to such terms of\r\naccommodation as that great Prince has approved, and the success which\r\nhas attended my negotiation has necessarily and immediately diffused\r\nthe blessings of peace throughout Europe._’ The infamous fallacy of\r\nthis whole sentence is apparent to all mankind; for it is known that\r\nthe King of Prussia did not barely approve, but absolutely dictated as\r\nconqueror, every article of the terms of peace. No advantage of any\r\nkind has accrued to that magnanimous Prince from our negotiation; but\r\nhe was basely deserted by the Scottish Prime Minister of England. He\r\nwas known by every Court in Europe to be scarcely on better terms here\r\nthan at Vienna, and he was betrayed by us in the treaty of peace. What\r\na strain of insolence, therefore, is it in a minister to lay claim\r\nto what he is conscious his efforts tended to prevent, and meanly\r\nto arrogate to himself a share in the fame and glory of one of the\r\ngreatest Princes the world has ever seen!”--E.\r\n\r\n[342] Robert Wood, author of the accounts of Balbec and Palmyra, and\r\nUnder-Secretary of State. He had been so made by Lord Chatham, but had\r\ndeserted him. [Mr. Wood was still, and for some time after, on most\r\nfriendly terms with Lord Chatham.

He published\r\nvarious tracts on law and antiquities, and was a great collector of\r\nbooks and medals. He died in 1770, aged 70.--E.\r\n\r\n[344] When Charles King of Naples, on the death of his brother King\r\nFerdinand, succeeded to the crown of Spain, he set aside his eldest son\r\nas an idiot, made the second Prince of Asturias, and the third King of\r\nNaples.\r\n\r\n[345] He was appointed King’s Counsel in May, 1757, and Baron of the\r\nExchequer in Hilary Term, 1762. He resigned in May, 1764. We cannot\r\nfind anything more about him. His praise of the peace seems to have\r\nbeen on his first circuit; probably, while his surprise and gratitude\r\nwere fresh. There are no Exchequer reports of that time. Except on the\r\ncircuit, a Baron of the Exchequer was then, and long after, almost a\r\nsinecurist.--E.\r\n\r\n[346] Ralph Allen, of Prior Park, near Bath, Master of the Cross-posts.\r\n\r\n[347] Mr. Pitt had openly pronounced the peace _inadequate_, and it\r\nseemed to be personally levelled at him, that the address affected to\r\ncall it _adequate_. [Bishop Warburton insists on Allen’s ignorance\r\nof Mr. Pitt having applied the term “inadequate” to the peace, and\r\ndisclaims any concern in it himself; though he admits having drawn\r\nup, promoted, and advised a similar address from the clergy of\r\nGloucester, whose interference, on this occasion, “had the fate,” Mr.\r\nPitt observed, “not to be imitated by any other episcopal see in the\r\nkingdom.” Allen, who was now an old man, felt Mr. Pitt’s resentment\r\nacutely, and immediately withdrew from this corporation. He died on\r\nthe 29th June of the following year, having bequeathed to Mr. Pitt\r\na legacy of 1000_l._ Mr. Pitt’s letter of condolence to his widow\r\nshows, that whatever coolness the address might have produced in their\r\nintercourse was short-lived.

Lord Hyde was an amiable nobleman,\r\nof very comely person, and graceful deportment; he married one of the\r\ncoheiresses of Lord Clarendon, was elevated to that earldom in 1776,\r\nand died in 1786.--E.]\r\n\r\n[352] Mr. Grenville was deeply offended at this interference of the\r\nDuke of Bedford; and his friends, in consequence, took no pains to\r\ndefend the Duke when the current of popular feeling afterwards turned\r\nso strongly against his Grace.--E.\r\n\r\n[353] Mr. Pitt’s villa at Hayes, near Bromley, in Kent.\r\n\r\n[354] Walpole is mistaken in this supposition; for the King himself\r\nproposed Lord Temple for the Treasury.

An impartial narrative of this transaction is given\r\nby Mr. Adolphus (vol. i. p. 127), with a reference to the contemporary\r\nauthorities, of which the most important are Lord Hardwicke’s letter,\r\nand the letters in the Chatham Correspondence (vol. ii. p. 242). The\r\n“dexterity” and finesse ascribed in the text to Mr. Pitt hardly belong\r\nto his character, and certainly were not exhibited on this occasion.\r\nHis private correspondence proves, as he told the King, that he felt\r\nthroughout the impossibility of his making a ministry, unless it rested\r\n“on the great families who had supported the Revolution Government,\r\nand other great persons, of whose ability and integrity the country\r\nhad had experience, and who had weight and credit in the nation.” This\r\nwould necessarily have involved greater changes than the King then\r\ncontemplated, though not greater than his Majesty subsequently found\r\ninevitable.--E.\r\n\r\n[355] Henry Arthur Herbert, Earl of Powis.\r\n\r\n[356] He had been succeeded as Treasurer of the Household by Lord Powis.\r\n\r\n[357] His Majesty did not give him up in less than two years on the\r\nnext change.\r\n\r\n[358] Charles Watson Wentworth, Marquis of Rockingham.\r\n\r\n[359] Welbore Ellis, Esq.\r\n\r\n[360] George Keppel, third Earl of Albemarle.\r\n\r\n[361] Walpole is in error here. Wood informed Mr. Pitt of the report,\r\nthat he had proscribed Lord Gower, Rigby, and others of the Bedford\r\nparty; and Mr. Pitt’s reply, though it has not been preserved, may\r\nbe inferred, from Wood’s acknowledgment of it, to have amounted to a\r\npositive denial of the charge.

He died\r\nin 1787.--E.\r\n\r\n[368] Don Richard Wall, of Irish extraction, was Ambassador here\r\nfrom Spain in the reign of George the Second. He was a most artful,\r\nagreeable man, of much wit, and a great favourite at this Court. At\r\nhis return to Madrid, he had been made Secretary of State in 1754,\r\n[upon the downfall of Enseñada. Sir Benjamin Keene, by his advice and\r\ninfluence, materially contributed to this event, which proved highly\r\nfavourable to the British interests at Madrid. The intrigues in the\r\nSpanish Court, and the financial difficulties of the country, made\r\nWall’s post a very irksome one. He discharged its duties at least as\r\nably as either his predecessor or his successor. The King was unwilling\r\nto part with him, and made his retirement honourable by many marks of\r\ndistinction. He passed the remaining years of his life chiefly at Soto\r\nde Roma, a royal castle, in the lovely valley of Grenada, where he\r\nmaintained a splendid hospitality. Mr. Swinburne visited him there, and\r\nhas given a very agreeable account of him. He died 1778.--E.]\r\n\r\n[369] Grimaldi was a Genoese. He had been educated for the church,\r\nand always retained the soft and insinuating manners of an Italian\r\necclesiastic. It was to his address, rather than to his talents,\r\nthat he was indebted for high situations he filled. In negotiating\r\nthe celebrated treaty of Paris, he appears to have been overmatched\r\nby Choiseul, and the loss of the Havannah, and the other misfortunes\r\nof the war, were the immediate fruits of his eagerness for a French\r\nalliance. His administration in Spain was neither popular nor\r\nsuccessful. It ended with the failure of the expedition to Algiers.\r\nHis chief merit lay in the encouragement he gave to literature, his\r\npatronage of the arts, his love of justice, and the mildness and\r\ngenerosity of his disposition. On his resignation, in 1777, he was\r\ncreated a Duke, and a Grandee of Spain. Having been allowed to nominate\r\nhis successor, he was at his own request appointed Ambassador at\r\nRome.

In 1771, I heard Mr. Phelps,\r\nsecretary to Lord Sandwich, relate that Vergy had offered him to act,\r\ntoo, as a spy on Guerchy, of which Mr. Phelps gave the ambassador\r\nwarning. Vergy remained here several years, and wrote pamphlets and\r\nnovels for a livelihood.\r\n\r\n[373] When they talked to D’Eon of a breach of the peace, he understood\r\nEnglish so imperfectly, that he thought Lord Halifax threatened to\r\nbreak the peace between the two nations, of which he, D’Eon, had been\r\nthe messenger, and that inflamed his madness.\r\n\r\n[374] Augustus the Third, a weak and unfortunate monarch, whose reign\r\nforms one of the most melancholy epochs in the annals of Saxony. His\r\nincapacity was more remarkable from his being opposed to Frederick the\r\nGreat and Catherine the Second.

He was the second son of Archbishop\r\nPotter, whose fortune he inherited, owing to his elder brother having\r\ndisobliged his father by an imprudent marriage. In 1748 he had been\r\nappointed secretary to the Prince of Wales, then the patron of all\r\nthe talent in the House opposed to the Government, and from that time\r\nhe took an active part in the political contests of the day. He was a\r\nclever and impressive speaker, and, with application and steadiness\r\nof conduct, might have become one of the leaders of his party.\r\nUnfortunately, he had contracted, in early life, habits of dissipation,\r\nunder which his constitution sunk, just as his ambitious hopes bade\r\nfair to be realized. He died Vice-Treasurer of Ireland, in June, 1759.\r\nSome interesting letters from him to Mr. Pitt are given in the Chatham\r\nCorrespondence, vol. i.--E.]\r\n\r\n[379] James Douglas, Earl of March and Ruglen, Lord of the Bedchamber\r\nto the King, [afterwards the too well-known Duke of Queensberry--an\r\nappropriate patron of such a divine.--E.]\r\n\r\n[380] Lord Despencer said, he never heard the devil preach before.\r\nYet Lord Sandwich had a precedent in a great Reformer of the Church:\r\n“Calvin eut par trahison les feuilles d’un ouvrage que Servet faisait\r\nimprimer secrètement.

[He inherited from his father the borough of Old Sarum, for\r\nwhich he brought himself into Parliament in 1761. In 1763 he was made a\r\nLord of the Admiralty. In 1784 created Lord Camelford. He went abroad\r\nfor his health in 1787, and died at Florence in 1793. The letters\r\naddressed to him when a student at Cambridge, by Lord Chatham, have\r\nattached an interest to his name beyond what belongs to his political\r\ncareer; and it is singular that he should, at the very outset of his\r\npublic life, have abruptly separated from one whose opinions up to\r\nthat time he seems to have entirely shared. Their connection was not\r\nafterwards resumed, though, as Lord Chatham’s relative, he returned\r\nthanks (rather coldly) to the House for the marks of distinction\r\nconferred on that great man’s memory. He is described by his\r\nson-in-law, Lord Grenville, “as combining a steadiness of principle and\r\na correctness of judgment with an integrity of heart, which produced\r\nthe affectionate attachment from those who knew him that has followed\r\nhim beyond the grave.” Many of his letters during his residence abroad\r\nare printed in Nichols’s Illustrations of Literary History, vol. vi. p.\r\n75; they show more amiability of disposition than power of mind, and\r\nwere scarcely worth being preserved.

On the 14th, the Prince had addressed him a very\r\ncomplimentary letter. Chatham Correspondence, vol. ii. p. 272, and\r\nnote.--E.\r\n\r\n[417] The Prince succeeded to the Dukedom on the death of his father\r\nin 1780, and for some years after resided at Brunswick, where the\r\nPrincess, who was throughout life deservedly esteemed, made his Court\r\nvery agreeable. In 1787 he commanded the Prussian forces which took\r\npossession of Amsterdam, and put down the republican party in Holland.\r\nHis campaigns against the French republicans were less successful,\r\nand his well-known manifesto rendered his failure more glaring. He\r\nwas mortally wounded at Auerstadt, and expired at Altona on the 10th\r\nof November, 1806, leaving behind him the reputation of a bold and\r\nenterprising, rather than of an able general. His Duchess took refuge\r\nin England, where she died at an advanced age. They were not happy\r\nin their family: of their two daughters, the eldest married the late\r\nKing of Wirtemberg, and came to a miserable end in Russia; the younger\r\nwas the unfortunate Queen Caroline. Their eldest son was of a weak\r\nunderstanding, and the younger, “Brunswick’s fated Chieftain,” a Prince\r\nof moderate abilities but signal courage, fell in middle life at\r\nWaterloo.--E.\r\n\r\n[418] A general officer.\r\n\r\n[419] Sir William Meredith was elected for Wigan in 1755, and for\r\nLiverpool in 1762. In 1765 he was appointed a Lord of the Admiralty,\r\nan office which he resigned on the dismissal of the Rockingham\r\nAdministration. In 1774 he was sworn of the Privy Council, and made\r\nComptroller of the Household. He died in 1790.--Cavendish’s Debates,\r\n(note,) vol. i. p. 52.--E.\r\n\r\n[420] This character of Sir George Saville is not less honourable to\r\nhis memory than Mr. Burke’s well-known and brilliant panegyric at\r\nthe Bristol election in 1780. Few public men received more respect\r\nfrom their cotemporaries--few, perhaps, have so well earned it. He\r\ndevoted his time, his talents, and his purse almost exclusively to\r\nthe public service. Neither the fashionable nor literary circles of\r\nLondon, nor the pursuits of the country, had any charm for him; he\r\nseldom resided at Rufford, the splendid seat of his ancestors: business\r\nwas his passion, and whether in town or country, constituted his sole\r\noccupation; fortunately, he had abilities to perform it creditably,\r\nand his generosity, which was scarcely bounded by his great estate,\r\nhad always usefulness for its object. The same discernment appears\r\nin his selection of the Parliamentary questions with which his name\r\nis identified, such as the Limitation of the Claims of the Crown on\r\nLanded Estates; the Relief of Roman Catholics as well as of Protestant\r\nDissenters, and the Condemnation of General Warrants, and, lastly, the\r\nImproved Representation of the People: all these he advocated with an\r\nearnestness and singleness of purpose, and consistency of action, which\r\nextorted the admiration even of his opponents. Though not an impressive\r\nspeaker, he was always sensible and very fluent, and he spared no pains\r\nto understand his subject. His speeches, indeed, partook of one of the\r\ncharacteristics of his mind, which was a simplicity approaching to\r\nausterity, and an exemption from party, or even popular prejudices. His\r\nlife in all respects strictly corresponded with his principles, and\r\nwas unstained by vice or even by weakness of any kind; his death was\r\nregarded as a public loss. He died in 1784, unmarried, aged 57, and\r\nwith him ended the last line of the illustrious family of Saville. He\r\nwas a collateral descendant of the Marquis of Halifax, to whose estates\r\nhis father had succeeded.--E.\r\n\r\n[421] This house, in which James Earl Waldegrave died, has again become\r\nremarkable by a club created there in 1769 by several ladies of first\r\nrank; the first public female club ever known, and which gave great\r\noffence, though the ladies were almost all of distinguished virtue.\r\nNor, though the age was notorious for divorces, though most of the\r\nfemale members were of the greatest beauty, and though most of the\r\nyoung men of fashion were of the club, did any scandal happen from\r\nthat society. Even gaming, which at that time raged to so enormous a\r\ndegree, went to no great lengths there. So that vice and satire, which\r\nprevailed so exceedingly, did not always meet where they deserved to\r\nmeet. The King and Queen marked their disapprobation of the club, while\r\nLord Despenser, Lord Talbot, and Lord Pembroke were in place, while\r\nLady Berkeley was of the bedchamber to the Princess Dowager, though\r\nher husband, Lord Clare, had disavowed her last child, and while Miss\r\nChudleigh had remained Maid of Honour to her, though she had owned her\r\nmarriage with Captain Hervey to her Royal Highness, till she openly\r\nmarried the Duke of Kingston, though Hervey was alive; and was received\r\nby all the Royal Family as Duchess, after having been publicly kept by\r\nthe Duke as his mistress. No wonder the sanctity of the Court passed\r\nfor hypocrisy.\r\n\r\n[422] For an account of this debate, see Chatham Correspondence, vol.\r\nii. p. 281.--E.\r\n\r\n[423] A graphical description of this Debate is given by the author in\r\na letter to Lord Hertford, vol. iv. p. 359, of his Correspondence.--E.\r\n\r\n[424] For an account of Mr. Grenville’s speech, see James Grenville’s\r\nletter to Mr. Pitt.

He died in 1775.--E.\r\n\r\n[426] This speech of General Conway’s appears to have made a great\r\nimpression on the House. See the letter cited _supra_.--E.\r\n\r\n[427] The Right Honourable James Oswald, of Dunnikier, already\r\nmentioned as the adviser and warm partisan of Lord Bute. This was\r\none of the last questions of great public interest in which he took\r\npart, his health being now on the decline; indeed he retired from\r\nParliament at the dissolution. He had been member for Kirkaldy, his\r\nnative district, for more than twenty years, and possessed considerable\r\nweight in the House, as a clear, well-informed, sensible, and effective\r\nspeaker. His services were rewarded with a large sinecure for his son,\r\nand a bishoprick for his brother. It is due to his memory to notice\r\nhis kindness to men of letters; David Hume’s History and Political\r\nEssays were submitted to his revision before they went to press, and\r\nLord Kaimes and Adam Smith lay under similar obligations to him. His\r\ncriticisms, however, were probably the least valuable fruits of his\r\nfriendship. His Correspondence was published some years ago, under the\r\ntitle of “Memorials of the Right Honourable James Oswald.” Most of his\r\npapers having been burnt, the book contains nothing remarkable.--E.\r\n\r\n[428] Afterwards Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and a peer of that kingdom\r\nby the title of Lord Lifford. He filled that office with great credit.\r\nHis judgments in the Court of Chancery were reported by Mr. Freeman,\r\nand the work is still one of some authority. He died in 1769.--E.\r\n\r\n[429] Charles Lord Viscount Townshend, minister at the Hague, and\r\nafterwards Secretary of State to the Kings George the First and Second.\r\nBy his eldest son, Charles, he was grandfather of General George\r\nTownshend, afterwards Viscount, and of the famous Charles Townshend.\r\nHis second son, Thomas, was father of another Thomas, often mentioned\r\nin these Memoirs. William, third son, was father of another Charles\r\nTownshend, called the black or Spanish Charles, from having been\r\nSecretary to the Embassy at Madrid.\r\n\r\n[430] Robert Wood died in September, 1771; he was writing Dissertations\r\non Homer, since published.\r\n\r\n[431] See what is said of them in the Advertisement prefixed to the\r\nfirst volume of the Anecdotes of Painting.\r\n\r\n[432] Mr. Bouverie and Mr. Dawkins.\r\n\r\n[433] Pitt had issued two general warrants during the war.\r\n\r\n[434] Alluding to the enormous debt contracted by the war.\r\n\r\n[435] Being dependent on Lord Shelburne, Barré had, under him,\r\nconnected himself with Mr. Pitt, whom he had so savagely attacked not\r\nlong before, and had been dismissed from the army.\r\n\r\n[436] Richard Hussey, Esq., M. P. for East Looe, Attorney-General\r\nto the Queen, Counsel to the Admiralty, and Auditor to the Duchy of\r\nCornwall and Greenwich Hospital.

Cavendish’s Debates,\r\nvol. i. p. 197, note.--E.\r\n\r\n[437] Alluding to Mr. Pitt.\r\n\r\n[438] Wilkes subsequently published a very friendly letter, dated 26th\r\nMarch, 1763, addressed to him by Mr. Legge, inviting him to meet Dr.\r\nHay at dinner. Indeed the intimacy of Wilkes was a reproach shared at\r\nthat time with Dr. Hay by several of the most eminent persons in the\r\nkingdom. And it was not till after the publication of the forty-fifth\r\nnumber of the North Briton, on the 23rd of April, 1763, that their eyes\r\nwere open to the enormity of his offences.--E.\r\n\r\n[439] Arthur Onslow, Speaker in the reign of George the Second.\r\n\r\n[440] Lord Howe was then only an Irish Peer. He had succeeded to his\r\ntitle on the death of his elder brother at Ticonderago in 1758. His\r\ngreat services raised him to the English Peerage in 1782, as Viscount\r\nHowe, and as Earl Howe in 1788. He died in 1799.--E.\r\n\r\n[441] This debate is described in the author’s letters to Lord\r\nHertford.--Correspondence, vol. iv. p. 373.--E.\r\n\r\n[442] This statement is probably much exaggerated. There is no doubt\r\nthat Pratt applied to the Court, according to the usual practice, to\r\nappoint a day for Hensey’s execution. Lord Mansfield desired him to\r\nname the day, and on Hensey’s solicitor asking that it might not be\r\nan early day, Pratt said he was ready to give as long a day as might\r\nbe proper. At last the Court agreed that it might be a month.--Burr.\r\nReports, vol. i. p. 651, R. v. Hensey. The sentimentality imputed to\r\nPratt certainly formed no part of his character; and as the story is\r\nwithout question inaccurate, we may fairly doubt whether Norton was\r\nguilty of so curious a piece of brutality. Hensey was respited on the\r\nvery morning that he was going to execution. On the 5th of Sept. 1759,\r\nhe appeared in Court and pleaded a full pardon.--E.\r\n\r\n[443] Hugh Smithson Percy, Earl of Northumberland. His eldest\r\nson married a daughter of Lord Bute. Both the Earl and Brecknock\r\nafterwards, finding their expectations not answered, turned against the\r\nCourt. Brecknock was hanged twenty years after in Ireland, for being\r\naccessory to an atrocious murder perpetrated by Mr. Fitzgerald, who\r\nsuffered with him.\r\n\r\n[444] The compliment was not insincere, for the King probably\r\nentertained more enlarged views of constitutional liberty than Lord\r\nMarchmont. His Lordship clung to his Jacobite principles to the last,\r\nthough he changed their object.--E.\r\n\r\n[445] Lord Holland has justly observed, “that wherever that great\r\nmagistrate (Lord Hardwicke) is concerned, Lord Orford’s resentments\r\nblind his judgment and disfigure his narrative.”--Mem. vol. i. p.\r\n139, note. He certainly has in this instance drawn a caricature, of\r\nwhich there is no merit in the execution to compensate for the faults\r\nof the design. Lord Chesterfield, though also a political opponent,\r\nhas done Lord Hardwicke more justice.--See Miscell. Works, vol. iv.\r\np. 51. Admitting many of his eminent qualities, he elegantly says of\r\nhis avarice, that though it was his ruling passion, he never was in\r\nthe least suspected of any kind of corruption; a rare and meritorious\r\ninstance of virtue and self-denial, under the influence of such a\r\ncraving, insatiable, and increasing passion.--See also Lord Mahon’s\r\nHist. vol. iii. p. 201. The Editor has only further to observe, that\r\nnone but a lawyer who has practised in the Court where Lord Hardwicke\r\nso long presided, can correctly appreciate his discharge of the duties\r\nof that high office. His judgments maintain their authority to the\r\npresent hour, and furnish the earliest and clearest exposition of the\r\nprinciples of the Equity Jurisdiction of this country. And whoever may\r\nhave had the opportunity of examining his Lordship’s note-books, will\r\nsee the patient attention and indefatigable research that distinguished\r\nevery part of his judicial career.--E.\r\n\r\n[446] John Perceval, second Earl of Egmont.\r\n\r\n[447] In America.\r\n\r\n[448] All the sums mentioned in this speech must be carefully\r\nre-examined, for I am not sure they are exact; [nor has the Editor been\r\nable to verify them.--E.]\r\n\r\n[449] A plan, of which the consequences were so little foreseen, that\r\nWalpole does not even notice it in a letter to Lord Hertford, written\r\ntwo days afterwards. Corresp. vol. iv. p. 386.--E.\r\n\r\n[450] Afterwards Sir George Amyand. [He was one of the leading\r\nDirectors of the East India Company, and an eminent merchant in the\r\nCity. He died in 1766.--E.]\r\n\r\n[451] It appears to have been Lord Clive himself who made this\r\nobservation: “not thinking it strictly honourable to take advantage of\r\nthis sudden spirit of generosity, and to carry merely by his popularity\r\na case which was depending at law, he rose and requested that they\r\nwould desist from their liberal intentions: adding, that from being\r\nsensible of the impropriety of going abroad while so valuable a part\r\nof his property remained in dispute, he would make some proposals to\r\nthe Court of Directors, which would, he trusted, end in an amicable\r\nadjustment of this affair.” Malcolm’s Life of Lord Clive, vol. ii. p.\r\n230.--E.\r\n\r\n[452] One of the Aldermen, and member for Plympton. He had married one\r\nof the coheiresses of Jacob Tonson, the printer.--E.\r\n\r\n[453] The book displays cleverness rather than “_great parts_.”\r\nD’Eon was an unprincipled coxcomb, bold, ready, and plausible; with\r\na smattering of literature, and more than common powers of writing.\r\nAt the outset of the dispute he was not much in the wrong, for the\r\ndifficulties raised to the payment of his disbursements as Minister\r\nwere ungenerous, if not unjust; and M. Guerchy’s lamentations over the\r\nguinea per month lavishly expended in English Gazettes would have put\r\nthe forbearance of most men to a severe test. In his passion D’Eon\r\nforgot the laws of decency as well as of honour, and the publication\r\nof his book injured him certainly not less than his enemies. It had\r\nan immense circulation, and the attempts to suppress it at Paris, of\r\ncourse, served to make it more sought after. Lord Holland, who happened\r\nto be there at that time, used to lend his copy by the hour. A reply\r\nto D’Eon was published, under the title of “Examen des Lettres, &c.\r\ndu Chevalier d’Eon, dans une Lettre à M. N--” and is smart enough.\r\nThe Critical Review (1764) treats it as a satisfactory refutation\r\nof D’Eon’s charges; but the public continued to laugh at the French\r\nAmbassador and his Government, and they fell in general estimation\r\nfully to the extent stated in the text.--E.\r\n\r\n[454] Walpole’s hatred of Lord Chancellor Hardwicke may be traced\r\nin this portrait of his son. Lord Hardwicke was one of the best\r\ninformed noblemen of his day. The Athenian Letters which he wrote, in\r\nconjunction with his brother, whilst at the University, ranks next to\r\nthe Travels of Anacharsis among works of its kind. “The Correspondence\r\nof Sir Dudley Carleton” is more curious than interesting; and the\r\neditor seems to have correctly appreciated it, by restricting his\r\nfirst edition to twenty copies, and his second to fifty. Perhaps there\r\nwas some ostentation in terming the next impression a third edition.\r\nHe is entitled to more credit for his State Papers, published in two\r\nvolumes, quarto,--a work of value, and which still fully maintains\r\nits consideration. Lord Hardwicke’s health was very delicate, and\r\nhe neither liked nor shone in general society, but he did not want\r\ndecision of character, and had a strong sense of honour. He was\r\nfirm in his political connections, and exemplary in private life. A\r\nbiographical account of him is given in Cole’s MSS. in the British\r\nMuseum, Donation, 5886.--E.\r\n\r\n[455] Thomas Pitt, of Boconnock, nephew of Mr. William Pitt, but\r\nattached to Mr. G. Grenville, and by him made a Lord of the Admiralty.\r\n\r\n[456] Frederick Montagu, only son of Charles Montagu, of Paplewich in\r\nNorthamptonshire, Auditor to the late Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\n[457] The chief of the Whigs in Opposition.\r\n\r\n[458] Son of Sir Orlando Bridgman, after whose death he became Sir\r\nHenry; [and having succeeded to the estates of his cousin Thomas, the\r\nlast Earl of Bradford, who had died without issue, was in 1794 created\r\nBaron Bradford. He died at an advanced age in 1800. He was grandfather\r\nof the present Earl.--E.]\r\n\r\n[459] Younger brother of Henry Vernon, of Hilton in Staffordshire;\r\nand married to Lady Evelyn Leveson, Countess Dowager of Ossory. [Mr.\r\nVernon’s later life was more creditable. He became a great traveller,\r\nand visited the East; and he served with distinction as a volunteer in\r\nthe Spanish expedition to Algiers. He was one of the handsomest men of\r\nhis day.--E.]\r\n\r\n[460] Charles Sloane Cadogan, only son of Charles Lord Cadogan,\r\n[afterwards created Earl Cadogan. His second wife was Miss Churchill, a\r\nniece of Horace Walpole. He died in 1807, aged 78.--E.]\r\n\r\n[461] Dr. Akenside, by some thought a Poet, was of the same principles\r\nwith, and an intimate friend of, Dyson, who obtained his being named\r\nPhysician to the Queen. To that mistress and to that friend he made a\r\nsacrifice of the word _Liberty_, in the last edition of his poem on the\r\nPleasures of the Imagination. It was uncourtly, a personification to be\r\ninvoked by one who felt the pulse of royalty. [The alteration to which\r\nWalpole refers is as follows. In the old editions there is the passage--\r\n\r\n            Wilt thou, kind Harmony, descend,\r\n    And join the festive train, for with thee comes,\r\n    _Majestic Truth_; and where _Truth_ deigns to come,\r\n    Her sister Liberty will not be far.\r\n\r\nIn the later editions it stands thus--\r\n\r\n    ... for with thee comes\r\n    _Wise Order_; and where _Order_ deigns to come,\r\n    Her sister Liberty will not be far.\r\n\r\n    _Nichols’s Liter. Anec._ vol. viii. p. 525.\r\n\r\nAkenside’s political tergiversation is an unpleasant commentary on a\r\nwork so full of elevated thoughts as his poem. Personal attachment to\r\nDyson probably influenced him. He died in 1770, in his forty-ninth\r\nyear.--E.]\r\n\r\n[462] Mr. Dyson had changed his politics on the King’s accession, when\r\nhe became at once a determined Tory, having previously professed the\r\nopposite creed. He afterwards formed one of the party that went under\r\nthe name of the King’s friends, a political section which can hardly\r\nbe said to have existed in preceding reigns, and which the personal\r\ncharacter of George the Third rendered very influential on public\r\nmeasures. A more valuable recruit could not easily have been found.\r\nHe was certainly a most able parliamentary lawyer, and the exactness\r\nand precision that characterised his mind, caused his opinion to be\r\nalways depended upon. These qualities, added to his discretion, gave\r\nhim a moral influence over the House which could not be the result of\r\nhis political conduct. His manners were obliging, and his private life\r\nirreproachable. It is highly to his credit that, when Clerk of the\r\nHouse, he departed from the example of his predecessors, by making no\r\nprofit of his patronage. Nichols’s Literary Anecdotes, vol. viii. p.\r\n523; Hatsell’s Parliamentary Precedents.--E.\r\n\r\n[463] Catherine and Charlotte Shorter were daughters of John Shorter,\r\nof Bybrook in Kent. Catherine was first wife of Sir Robert Walpole,\r\nand mother of the author of these Memoirs. Charlotte was third wife\r\nof Francis Seymour, Lord Conway, and by him mother of Francis Earl of\r\nHertford, and of General Henry Seymour Conway.\r\n\r\n[464] I have seen a letter from the King to George Grenville, in which\r\nhis Majesty pressed him to turn out Conway.\r\n\r\n[465] John Fane, Earl of Westmoreland.\r\n\r\n[466] Sir Richard Temple, Lord Viscount Cobham.\r\n\r\n[467] This does not mean the vote of a single day, but all the votes on\r\ngeneral warrants considered as one question.\r\n\r\n[468] General John Campbell, Groom of the Bedchamber to George the\r\nSecond, and cousin and successor of John and Archibald Dukes of Argyle\r\nwhen an old man.\r\n\r\n[469] Caroline, daughter of the latter Duke John, third wife and widow\r\nof Charles Bruce, last Earl of Ailesbury, by whom she had an only\r\nchild, Mary Duchess of Richmond. The Countess of Ailesbury married\r\nsecondly General Henry Seymour Conway, only brother of Francis first\r\nEarl of Hertford of that branch.\r\n\r\n[470] John Campbell, Marquis of Lorn, married to the famous beauty\r\nElizabeth Gunning, widow of James Duke of Hamilton.\r\n\r\n[471] Lord Frederick Campbell had been bred to the law, and succeeded\r\nwell there, but quitted the profession on his father’s attaining the\r\ndukedom. [As he was brother in-law to General Conway, Mr. Walpole seems\r\nto have expected him to have followed Conway’s politics.--Mr. Croker’s\r\nnote to the fourth volume of Walpole’s Letters, p. 369. Wraxall says\r\nof him, “Devoid of shining talents, he nevertheless wanted not either\r\nability or eloquence in a certain degree, both which were under the\r\ncontrol of reason and temper. His figure and deportment were remarkably\r\ngraceful.” He married the Dowager Countess Ferrers, sister of Sir\r\nWilliam Meredith, and died at an advanced age in 1816.--E.]\r\n\r\n[472] Lord Hertford could not reasonably be expected to court a share\r\nin the consequences of an act of which he disapproved: and he was of a\r\ntemperament that too easily disposed him to shrink from any personal\r\nsacrifice. His political principles were very indefinite. His merit was\r\nof a different character. Lord Chesterfield was sincere when he said\r\nof him, in a letter not intended for publication, “I verily believe\r\nhe will please as Viceroy, for he is one of the honestest and most\r\nreligious men in the kingdom, and moreover very much of a gentleman\r\nin his behaviour to everybody.”--His administration of Ireland was\r\nrespectable, and in general approved of, and it passed away in almost\r\nuniform tranquillity.--Hardy’s Life of Lord Charlemont, vol. i. p. 224.\r\nHe filled many high offices, and was very prosperous throughout life.\r\nHe was created Marquis in 1793, and died in the following year, leaving\r\na large family.--E.\r\n\r\n[473] Lord Hertford had married Lady Isabella Fitzroy, youngest\r\ndaughter of Charles Duke of Grafton, who was succeeded in the title by\r\nhis grandson Augustus Henry, of whom much will be said in some of the\r\nfollowing pages.\r\n\r\n[474] The Duke subsequently gave the best proof of the sincerity of\r\nthis offer by bequeathing General Conway a legacy of 5000_l._--E.\r\n\r\n[475] Conway conducted himself less well than Wolfe at Rochfort, but\r\nfar better than the other generals. “Though eminently distinguished\r\nfor his gallant and indefatigable behaviour,” says Walpole, “he never\r\nhad the happiness of achieving any action of remarkable éclât, or\r\nof performing _alone_ any act of singular utility to his country.\r\nHowever, he had been engaged in six regular battles, besides smaller\r\naffairs.”--(Counter Address to the Public on the Dismissal of a late\r\nGeneral.) He commanded a division with credit in the Seven years’\r\nwar. An ill-natured cotemporary critic charges him with being a\r\n“_martinet_,” and with unnecessarily fatiguing his men, but admits that\r\n“he would have made a very good general if he had not been spoilt by\r\nhis education under the Duke of Cumberland.” Life of Lord Chatham, Ap.\r\nvol. iii. p. 262.--E.\r\n\r\n[476] The Queen’s brother.\r\n\r\n[477] Lord Pembroke was again made a Lord of the Bedchamber in 1769,\r\nwithout applying; and exactly at a time when he was said to have\r\ncarried off another woman, a young Venetian bride (he was then at\r\nVenice), the very night of her wedding. [Lord Pembroke had served in\r\nthe Seven years’ war, and was popular with the officers under him,\r\nthough not much of a soldier. He was dissolute and extravagant, and\r\nnotwithstanding his large income, left when he died heavy debts, which\r\nhis only son, the late Earl, a very respectable nobleman, honourably\r\npaid.--E.]\r\n\r\n[478] Dr. Thomas Newton, Bishop of Bristol.\r\n\r\n[479] Twickenham.\r\n\r\n[480] Thomas Worseley, Surveyor of the Board of Works.\r\n\r\n[481] Sir Hugh Smithson, of a very recent family, had married Lady\r\nElizabeth Seymour, only daughter of Algernon Duke of Somerset, whose\r\nmother was heiress of the Percies, Earls of Northumberland; on which\r\nfoundation Hugh and Elizabeth were created Earl and Countess of\r\nNorthumberland.\r\n\r\n[482] Dr. Johnson said, in allusion to it, “that his Grace was only fit\r\nto succeed himself.” Boswell, vol. ii. p. 210.--E.\r\n\r\n[483] He had been likewise Secretary to the Earl of Halifax.\r\n\r\n[484] Charles sixth Earl and first Marquis of Drogheda, K.P.--The\r\nPrimate had four years before importunately pressed Mr. Pitt to give\r\nthis nobleman the rank of colonel; and although the application was\r\nsupported by the Duke of Devonshire and Lord Besborough, Mr. Pitt was\r\nfirm in resisting it. “Among the very many lieutenant-colonels,” he\r\nsaid, “above Lord Drogheda on the list, there were not a few who could\r\nnot be postponed without great hardship, and loud complaints in the\r\narmy. He had publicly pledged himself to that most meritorious class of\r\nofficers, that he would never contribute, from any considerations of\r\nfamily or parliamentary interest, to their depression.” The Primate’s\r\nletter and Mr. Pitt’s reply are given in the Chatham Correspondence,\r\nvol. ii. p. 59. The transaction reflects great honour on Mr. Pitt,\r\nand furnishes an additional proof of the high sense of public duty\r\nentertained by that illustrious statesman, in this, as in many other\r\nrespects so superior, to most of his cotemporaries, not excepting\r\nthe Primate of Ireland. Lord Drogheda obtained his rank in 1762, and\r\neventually reached almost the head of the army list, having in his old\r\nage been appointed Field-Marshal. He died at Dublin in December 1821,\r\nin his ninety-second year. He saw little, if any, foreign service, but\r\nhe had been constantly employed in his own country, where he was much\r\nesteemed. He preserved to the last a remarkable elegance and amiability\r\nof deportment.--E.\r\n\r\n[485] It must be recollected, that Walpole, from some private cause,\r\nbore Lord and Lady Northumberland no good will, and frequently sneers\r\nat them in his Correspondence. A childish feeling of envy at Lord\r\nNorthumberland’s brilliant success in life, was probably at the\r\nbottom of this, and prevented Walpole’s making due allowance for the\r\ntemptations attendant on great and unexpected prosperity. His Lordship\r\nhad the tastes that became the high rank to which he was elevated. He\r\npatronized the arts, and was generous to men of letters. His vanity\r\nwas unaccompanied by arrogance, and his feelings, though not warm,\r\nwere kind and amiable. Neither his talents nor acquirements were above\r\nmediocrity. He died in 1786.--E.\r\n\r\n[486] The Duchess’s defects are, no doubt, greatly exaggerated by\r\nWalpole. M. Dutens says of her Grace, that “she possessed great\r\nelevation of mind, natural and easy wit, a good and compassionate\r\nheart, and, above all, a strong attachment to her friends, whom she\r\ntook every opportunity to distinguish and to serve.”--Memoirs of a\r\nTraveller, &c., vol. ii. p. 100. She met her death, which was sudden,\r\nwith great firmness and resignation.--E.\r\n\r\n[487] The marriage was unfortunate, and dissolved in 1779. Lord\r\nWarkworth became Duke of Northumberland in 1786. He served as Lord\r\nPercy in the American war. Unlike his father, he was totally devoid of\r\nostentation, and most simple and retiring in his habits. He died in\r\n1817.--E.\r\n\r\n[488] The house of Andrew Stone, in Privy Garden.\r\n\r\n[489] George Keppel, third Earl of Albemarle. His youngest sister, Lady\r\nElizabeth, was married to Francis Russell, Marquis of Tavistock, only\r\nson of John Duke of Bedford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nPunctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant\r\npreference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.\r\n\r\nThe spelling of non-English words was not reviewed.\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced\r\nquotation marks retained.\r\n\r\nAmbiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained; occurrences of\r\ninconsistent hyphenation have not been changed.\r\n\r\nText mostly uses “confident” where modern spelling is “confidant”, but\r\ndoes use “confidant” once.
