H. HAYES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book represents an attempt on the part of the author to satisfy a\r\nvery real need of a textbook which will reach far enough back to afford\r\nsecure foundations for a college course in modern European history.\r\n\r\nThe book is a long one, and purposely so. Not only does it undertake to\r\ndeal with a period at once the most complicated and the most inherently\r\ninteresting of any in the whole recorded history of mankind, but it\r\naims to impart sufficiently detailed information about the various\r\ntopics discussed to make the college student feel that he is advanced a\r\ngrade beyond the student in secondary school. There is too often a\r\ntendency to underestimate the intellectual capabilities of the\r\ncollegian and to feed him so simple and scanty a mental pabulum that he\r\nbecomes as a child and thinks as a child. Of course the author\r\nappreciates the fact that most college instructors of history piece out\r\nthe elementary textbooks by means of assignments of collateral reading\r\nin large standard treatises. All too frequently, however, such\r\nassignments, excellent in themselves, leave woeful gaps which a slender\r\nelementary manual is inadequate to fill. And the student becomes too\r\npainfully aware, for his own educational good, of a chasmal separation\r\nbetween his textbook and his collateral reading. The present manual is\r\ndesigned to supply a narrative of such proportions that the need of\r\nadditional reading will be somewhat lessened, and at the same time it\r\nis provided with critical bibliographies and so arranged as to enable\r\nthe judicious instructor more easily to make substitutions here and\r\nthere from other works or to pass over this or that section entirely.\r\nPerhaps these considerations will commend to others the judgment of the\r\nauthor in writing a long book.\r\n\r\nNowadays prefaces to textbooks of modern history almost invariably\r\nproclaim their writers' intention to stress recent happenings or at\r\nleast those events of the past which have had a direct bearing upon the\r\npresent. An examination of the following pages will show that in the\r\ncase of this book there is no discrepancy between such an intention on\r\nthe part of the present writer and its achievement. Beginning with the\r\nsixteenth century, the story of the civilization of modern Europe is\r\ncarried down the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries with\r\nconstant _crescendo_. Of the total space devoted to the four\r\nhundred years under review, the last century fills half. And the\r\ngreatest care has been taken to bring the story down to date and to\r\nindicate as clearly and calmly as possible the underlying causes of the\r\nvast contemporaneous European war, which has already put a new\r\ncomplexion on our old historical knowledge and made everything that\r\nwent before seem part and parcel of an old régime.\r\n\r\nAs to why the author has preferred to begin the story of modern Europe\r\nwith the sixteenth century, rather than with the thirteenth or with the\r\nFrench Revolution, the reader is specially referred to the\r\n_Introduction_. It has seemed to the author that particularly from\r\nthe Commercial Revolution of the sixteenth century dates the remarkable\r\nand steady evolution of that powerful middle class--the bourgeoisie--\r\nwhich has done more than all other classes put together to condition\r\nthe progress of the several countries of modern Europe and to create\r\nthe life and thought of the present generation throughout the world.\r\nThe rise of the bourgeoisie is the great central theme of modern\r\nhistory; it is the great central theme of this book.\r\n\r\nNot so very long ago distinguished historians were insisting that the\r\nstate, as the highest expression of man's social instincts and as the\r\nimmediate concern of all human beings, is the only fit subject of\r\nhistorical study, and that history, therefore, must be simply \"past\r\npolitics\"; under their influence most textbooks became compendiums of\r\ndata about kings and constitutions, about rebellions and battles. More\r\nrecently historians of repute, as well as eminent economists, have\r\ngiven their attention and patronage to painstaking investigations of\r\nhow, apart from state action, man in the past has toiled or traveled or\r\ndone the other ordinary things of everyday life; and the influence of\r\nsuch scholars has served to provide us with a considerable number of\r\nconvenient manuals on special phases of social history. Yet more\r\nrecently several writers of textbooks have endeavored to combine the\r\ntwo tendencies and to present in a single volume both political and\r\nsocial facts, but it must be confessed that sometimes these writers\r\nhave been content to tell the old political tale in orthodox manner and\r\nthen to append a chapter or two of social miscellany, whose connection\r\nwith the body of their book is seldom apparent to the student.\r\n\r\nThe present volume represents an effort really to combine political and\r\nsocial history in one synthesis: the author, quite convinced of the\r\nimportance of the view that political activities constitute the most\r\nperfect expression of man's social instincts and touch mankind most\r\nuniversally, has not neglected to treat of monarchs and parliaments, of\r\ndemocracy and nationalism; at the same time he has cordially accepted\r\nthe opinion that political activities are determined largely by\r\neconomic and social needs and ambitions; and accordingly he has\r\nundertaken not only to incorporate at fairly regular intervals such\r\nchapters as those on the Commercial Revolution, Society in the\r\nEighteenth Century, the Industrial Revolution, and Social Factors,\r\n1870-1914, but also to show in every part of the narrative the economic\r\naspects of the chief political facts.\r\n\r\nDespite the length of this book, critics will undoubtedly note\r\nomissions. Confronting the writer of every textbook of history is the\r\neternal problem of selection--the choice of what is most pointedly\r\nsignificant from the sum total of man's thoughts, words, and deeds. It\r\nis a matter of personal judgment, and personal judgments are\r\nnotoriously variant. Certainly there will be critics who will complain\r\nof the present author's failure to follow up his suggestions concerning\r\nsixteenth-century art and culture with a fuller account of the\r\ndevelopment of philosophy and literature from the seventeenth to the\r\ntwentieth century; and the only rejoinders that the harassed author can\r\nmake are the rather lame ones that a book, to be a book, must conform\r\nto the mechanical laws of space and dimension, and that a serious\r\nattempt on the part of the present writer to make a synthesis of social\r\nand political facts precludes no effort on the part of other and abler\r\nwriters to synthesize all these facts with the phenomena which are\r\nconventionally assigned to the realm of \"cultural\" or \"intellectual\"\r\nhistory. In this, and in all other respects, the author trusts that his\r\nparticular solution of the vexatious problem of selection will prove as\r\ngenerally acceptable as any.\r\n\r\nIn the all-important matter of accuracy, the author cannot hope to have\r\nescaped all the pitfalls that in a peculiarly broad and crowded field\r\neverywhere trip the feet of even the most wary and persistent searchers\r\nafter truth. He has naturally been forced to rely for the truth of his\r\nstatements chiefly upon numerous secondary works, of which some\r\nacknowledgment is made in the following _Note_, and upon the\r\nkindly criticisms of a number of his colleagues; in some instances,\r\nnotably in parts of the chapters on the Protestant Revolt, the French\r\nRevolution, and developments since 1848 in Great Britain, France, and\r\nGermany, he has been able to draw on his own special studies of primary\r\nsource material, and in certain of these instances he has ventured to\r\ndissent from opinions that have been copied unquestioningly from one\r\nwork to another.\r\n\r\nNo period of history can be more interesting or illuminating than the\r\nperiod with which this book is concerned, especially now, when a war of\r\ntremendous magnitude and meaning is attracting the attention of the\r\nwhole civilized world and arousing a desire in the minds of all\r\nintelligent persons to know something of the past that has produced it.\r\nThe great basic causes of the present war the author has sought, not in\r\nthe ambitions of a single power nor in an isolated outrage, but in the\r\nhistory of four hundred years. He has tried to write a book that would\r\nbe suggestive and informing, not only to the ordinary college student,\r\nbut to the more mature and thoughtful student of public affairs in the\r\nuniversity of the world.\r\n\r\nCARLTON J. H. HAYES. AFTON, NEW YORK, May, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author begs to acknowledge his general indebtedness to a veritable\r\nhost of historical writers, of whose original researches or secondary\r\ncompilations he has constantly and almost unblushingly made use in the\r\npreparation of this book. At the close of the _Introduction_ will\r\nbe found a list of the major works dealing with the whole period under\r\nreview, or with the greater part of it, which have been drawn upon most\r\nheavily. And there is hardly a book cited in any of the special\r\nbibliographies following the several chapters that has not supplied\r\nsome single fact or suggestion to the accompanying narrative.\r\n\r\nFor many of the general ideas set forth in this work as well as for\r\npainstaking assistance in reading manuscript and correcting errors of\r\ndetail, the author confesses his debt to various colleagues in Columbia\r\nUniversity and elsewhere. In particular, Professor R. L. Schuyler has\r\nhelpfully read the chapters on English history; Professor James T.\r\nShotwell, the chapter on the Commercial Revolution; Professor D. S.\r\nMuzzey, the chapters on the French Revolution, Napoleon, and\r\nMetternich; Professor William R. Shepherd, the chapters on \"National\r\nImperialism\"; and Professor Edward B. Krehbiel of Leland Stanford\r\nJunior University, the chapter on recent international relations.\r\nProfessor E. F. Humphrey of Trinity College (Connecticut) has given\r\nprofitable criticism on the greater part of the text; and Professor\r\nCharles A. Beard of Columbia University, Professor Sidney B. Fay of\r\nSmith College, and Mr. Edward L. Durfee of Yale University, have read\r\nthe whole work and suggested several valuable emendations. Three\r\ninstructors in history at Columbia have been of marked service--Dr.\r\nAustin P. Evans, Mr. D. R. Fox, and Mr. Parker T. Moon. The last named\r\ndevoted the chief part of two summers to the task of preparing notes\r\nfor several chapters of the book and he has attended the author on the\r\nlong dreary road of proof reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nVOLUME I\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nFOUNDATIONS OF MODERN EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.

If, as seems highly probable, the conservative estimates\r\nof recent scientists that mankind has inhabited the earth more than\r\nfifty thousand years [Footnote: Professor James Geikie, of the\r\nUniversity of Edinburgh, suggests, in his _Antiquity of Man in\r\nEurope_ (1914), the possible existence of human beings on the earth\r\nmore than 500,000 years ago!], are accurate, then the bare five hundred\r\nyears which these volumes pass in review constitute, in time, less than\r\na hundredth part of man's past. Certainly, thousands of years before\r\nour day there were empires and kingdoms and city-states, showing\r\nconsiderable advancement in those intellectual pursuits which we call\r\ncivilization or culture,--that is, in religion, learning, literature,\r\npolitical organization, and business; and such basic institutions as\r\nthe family, the state, and society go back even further, past our\r\nearliest records, until their origins are shrouded in deepest mystery.\r\nDespite its brevity, modern history is of supreme importance. Within\r\nits comparatively brief limits are set greater changes in human life\r\nand action than are to be found in the records of any earlier\r\nmillennium. While the present is conditioned in part by the deeds and\r\nthoughts of our distant forbears who lived thousands of years ago, it\r\nhas been influenced in a very special way by historical events of the\r\nlast five hundred years. Let us see how this is true.\r\n\r\nSuppose we ask ourselves in what important respects the year 1900\r\ndiffered from the year 1400. In other words, what are the great\r\ndistinguishing achievements of modern times? At least six may be noted:\r\n\r\n(1) _Exploration and knowledge of the whole globe_. To our\r\nancestors from time out of mind the civilized world was but the lands\r\nadjacent to the Mediterranean and, at most, vague stretches of Persia,\r\nIndia, and China. Not much over four hundred years ago was America\r\ndiscovered and the globe circumnavigated for the first time, and very\r\nrecently has the use of steamship, telegraph, and railway served to\r\nbind together the uttermost parts of the world, thereby making it\r\nrelatively smaller, less mysterious, and in culture more unified.\r\n\r\n(2) _Higher standards of individual efficiency and comfort_. The\r\nphysical welfare of the individual has been promoted to a greater\r\ndegree, or at all events preached more eloquently, within the last few\r\ngenerations than ever before. This has doubtless been due to changes in\r\nthe commonplace everyday life of all the people. It must be remembered\r\nthat in the fifteenth century man did the ordinary things of life in\r\nmuch the same manner as did early Romans or Greeks or Egyptians, and\r\nthat our present remarkable ways of living, of working, and of\r\ntraveling are the direct outcome of the Commercial Revolution of the\r\nsixteenth century and of the Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth.\r\n\r\n(3) _Intensification of political organization, with attendant public\r\nguarantees of personal liberties_. The ideas of nationalism and of\r\ndemocracy are essentially modern in their expression. The notion that\r\npeople who speak the same language and have a common culture should be\r\norganized as an independent state with uniform laws and customs was\r\nhardly held prior to the fifteenth century. The national states of\r\nEngland, France, and Spain did not appear unmistakably with their\r\nnational boundaries, national consciousness, national literature, until\r\nthe opening of the sixteenth century; and it was long afterwards that\r\nin Italy and Germany the national idea supplanted the older notions of\r\nworld empire or of city-state or of feudalism. The national state has\r\nproved everywhere a far more powerful political organization than any\r\nother: its functions have steadily increased, now at the expense of\r\nfeudalism, now at the expense of the church; and such increase has been\r\nas constant under industrial democracy of the nineteenth and twentieth\r\ncenturies as under the benevolent despotism of the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries. But in measure as government has enlarged its\r\nscope, the governed have worked out and applied protective principles\r\nof personal liberties. The Puritan Revolution, the French Revolution,\r\nthe American Revolution, the uprisings of oppressed populations\r\nthroughout the nineteenth century, would be quite inexplicable in other\r\nthan modern times. In fact the whole political history of the last four\r\ncenturies is in essence a series of compromises between the conflicting\r\nresults of the modern exaltation of the state and the modern exaltation\r\nof the individual.\r\n\r\n(4) _Replacement of the idea of the necessity of uniformity in a\r\ndefinite faith and religion by toleration of many faiths or even of no\r\nfaith_. A great state religion, professed publicly, and financially\r\nsupported by all the citizens, has been a distinguishing mark of every\r\nearlier age. Whatever else may be thought of the Protestant movement of\r\nthe sixteenth century, of the rise of deism and skepticism in the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth, and of the existence of scientific\r\nrationalism in the nineteenth and twentieth, there can be little doubt\r\nthat each of them has contributed its share to the prevalence of the\r\nidea that religion is essentially a private, not a public, affair and\r\nthat friendly rivalry in good works is preferable to uniformity in\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\n(5) _Diffusion of learning_. The invention of printing towards the\r\nclose of the fifteenth century gradually revolutionized the pursuit of\r\nknowledge and created a real democracy of letters. What learning might\r\nhave lost in depth through its marvelous broadening has perhaps been\r\ncompensated for by the application of the keenest minds in the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries to experimental science and in our\r\nown day to applied science.\r\n\r\n(6) _Spirit of progress and decline of conservatism_. For better\r\nor for worse the modern man is intellectually more self-reliant than\r\nhis ancestors, more prone to try new inventions and to profit by new\r\ndiscoveries, more conscious and therefore more critical of conditions\r\nabout him, more convinced that he lives in a better world than did his\r\nfathers, and that his children who come after him should have a better\r\nchance than he has had. This is the modern spirit. It is the product of\r\nall the other elements of the history of five hundred years--the larger\r\ngeographical horizon, the greater physical comfort, the revolutionized\r\npolitical institutions, the broader sympathies, the newer ideals of\r\neducation. Springing thus from events of the past few centuries, the\r\nmodern spirit nevertheless looks ever forward, not backward. A debtor\r\nto the past, it will be doubly creditor to the future. It will\r\ndetermine the type of individual and social betterment through coming\r\ncenturies. Such an idea is implied in the phrase, \"the continuity of\r\nhistory\"--the ever-flowing stream of happenings that brings down to us\r\nthe heritage of past ages and that carries on our richer legacies to\r\ngenerations yet unborn.\r\n\r\nFrom such a conception of the continuity of history, the real\r\nsignificance of our study can be derived. It becomes perfectly clear\r\nthat if we understand the present we shall be better prepared to face\r\nthe problems and difficulties of the future. But to understand the\r\npresent thoroughly, it becomes necessary not only to learn what are its\r\ngreat features and tendencies, but likewise how they have been evolved.\r\nNow, as we have already remarked, six most important characteristics of\r\nthe present day have been developed within the last four or five\r\ncenturies. To follow the history of this period, therefore, will tend\r\nto familiarize us both with present-day conditions and with future\r\nneeds. This is the genuine justification for the study of the history\r\nof modern times.\r\n\r\nModern history may conveniently be defined as that part of history\r\nwhich deals with the origin and evolution of the great distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics of the present. No precise dates can be assigned to\r\nmodern history as contrasted with what has commonly been called ancient\r\nor medieval. In a sense, any division of the historical stream into\r\nparts or periods is fundamentally fallacious: for example, inasmuch as\r\nthe present generation owes to the Greeks of the fourth century before\r\nChrist many of its artistic models and philosophical ideas and very few\r\nof its political theories, the former might plausibly be embraced in\r\nthe field of modern history, the latter excluded therefrom. But the\r\nproblem before us is not so difficult as may seem on first thought. To\r\nall intents and purposes the development of the six characteristics\r\nthat have been noted has taken place within five hundred years. The\r\nsixteenth century witnessed the true beginnings of the change in the\r\nextensive world discoveries, in the establishment of a recognized\r\nEuropean state system, in the rise of Protestantism, and in the\r\nquickening of intellectual activity. It is the foundation of modern\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth century will therefore be the general subject of Part I\r\nof this volume. After reviewing the geography of Europe about the year\r\n1500, we shall take up in turn the _four_ factors of the century\r\nwhich have had a lasting influence upon us: (1) socially and\r\neconomically--The Commercial Revolution; (2) politically--European\r\nPolitics in the Sixteenth Century; (3) religiously and\r\necclesiastically--The Protestant Revolt; (4) intellectually--The\r\nCulture of the Sixteenth Century.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL READING\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STUDY OF HISTORY.

THE NEW NATIONAL MONARCHIES\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"National Monarchies\" in 1500]\r\n\r\nBefore we can safely proceed with the story of European development\r\nduring the past four hundred years, it is necessary to know what were\r\nthe chief countries that existed at the beginning of our period and\r\nwhat were the distinctive political institutions of each.\r\n\r\nA glance at the map of Europe in 1500 will show numerous unfamiliar\r\ndivisions and names, especially in the central and eastern portions.\r\nOnly in the extreme west, along the Atlantic seaboard, will the eye\r\ndetect geographical boundaries which resemble those of the present day.\r\nThere, England, France, Spain, and Portugal have already taken form. In\r\neach one of these countries is a real nation, with a single monarch,\r\nand with a distinctive literary language. These four states are the\r\n_national_ states of the sixteenth century. They attract our\r\nimmediate attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLAND\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The English Monarchy]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1500 the English monarchy embraced little more than what on\r\nthe map is now called \"England.\" It is true that to the west the\r\nprincipality of Wales had been incorporated two hundred years earlier,\r\nbut the clannish mountaineers and hardy lowlanders of the northern part\r\nof the island of Great Britain still preserved the independence of the\r\nkingdom of Scotland, while Irish princes and chieftains rendered\r\nEnglish occupation of their island extremely precarious beyond the so-\r\ncalled Pale of Dublin which an English king had conquered in the\r\ntwelfth century. Across the English Channel, on the Continent, the\r\nEnglish monarchy retained after 1453, the date of the conclusion of the\r\nHundred Years' War, only the town of Calais out of the many rich French\r\nprovinces which ever since the time of William the Conqueror (1066-\r\n1087) had been a bone of contention between French and English rulers.\r\n\r\nWhile the English monarchy was assuming its geographical form, peculiar\r\nnational institutions were taking root in the country, and the English\r\nlanguage, as a combination of earlier Anglo-Saxon and Norman-French,\r\nwas being evolved. The Hundred Years' War with France, or rather its\r\noutcome, served to exalt the sense of English nationality and English\r\npatriotism, and to enable the king to devote his whole attention to the\r\nconsolidation of his power in the British islands. For several years\r\nafter the conclusion of peace on the Continent, England was harassed by\r\nbloody and confused struggles, known as the Wars of the Roses, between\r\nrival claimants to the throne, but at length, in 1485, Henry VII, the\r\nfirst of the Tudor dynasty, secured the crown and ushered in a new era\r\nof English history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Increase of Royal Power in England under Henry VII]\r\n\r\nHenry VII (1485-1509) sought to create what has been termed a \"strong\r\nmonarchy.\" Traditionally the power of the king had been restricted by a\r\nParliament, composed of a House of Lords and a House of Commons, and as\r\nthe former was then far more influential than the latter, supreme\r\npolitical control had rested practically with the king and the members\r\nof the upper house--great land-holding nobles and the princes of the\r\nchurch. The Wars of the Roses had two effects which redounded to the\r\nadvantage of the king: (1) the struggle, being really a contest of two\r\nfactions of nobles, destroyed many noble families and enabled the crown\r\nto seize their estates, thereby lessening the influence of an ancient\r\nclass; (2) the struggle, being long and disorderly, created in the\r\nmiddle class or \"common people\" a longing for peace and the conviction\r\nthat order and security could be maintained only by repression of the\r\nnobility and the strengthening of monarchy. Henry took advantage of\r\nthese circumstances to fix upon his country an absolutism, or one-man\r\npower in government, which was to endure throughout the sixteenth\r\ncentury, during the reigns of the four other members of the Tudor\r\nfamily, and, in fact, until a popular revolution in the seventeenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nHenry VII repressed disorder with a heavy hand and secured the\r\nestablishment of an extraordinary court, afterwards called the \"Court\r\nof Star Chamber,\" to hear cases, especially those affecting the nobles,\r\nwhich the ordinary courts had not been able to settle. Then, too, he\r\nwas very economical: the public revenue was increased by means of more\r\ncareful attention to the cultivation of the crown lands and the\r\ncollection of feudal dues, fines, benevolences [Footnote:\r\n\"Benevolences\" were sums of money extorted from the people in the guise\r\nof gifts. A celebrated minister of Henry VII collected a very large\r\nnumber of \"benevolences\" for his master. If a man lived economically,\r\nit was reasoned he was saving money and could afford a \"present\" for\r\nthe king. If, on the contrary, he lived sumptuously, he was evidently\r\nwealthy and could likewise afford a \"gift.\"], import and export duties,\r\nand past parliamentary grants, while, by means of frugality and a\r\nforeign policy of peace, the expenditure was appreciably decreased.\r\nHenry VII was thereby freed in large measure from dependence on\r\nParliament for grants of money, and the power of Parliament naturally\r\ndeclined. In fact, Parliament met only five times during his whole\r\nreign and only once during the last twelve years, and in all its\r\nactions was quite subservient to the royal desires.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foreign relations of England under Henry VII]\r\n\r\nHenry VII refrained in general from foreign war, but sought by other\r\nmeans to promote the international welfare of his country. He\r\nnegotiated several treaties by which English traders might buy and sell\r\ngoods in other countries. One of the most famous of these commercial\r\ntreaties was the _Intercursus Magnus_ concluded in 1496 with the\r\nduke of Burgundy, admitting English goods into the Netherlands. He\r\nlikewise encouraged English companies of merchants to engage in foreign\r\ntrade and commissioned the explorations of John Cabot in the New World.\r\nHenry increased the prestige of his house by politic marital alliances.\r\nHe arranged a marriage between the heir to his throne, Arthur, and\r\nCatherine, eldest daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, the Spanish\r\nsovereigns. Arthur died a few months after his wedding, but it was\r\narranged that Catherine should remain in England as the bride of the\r\nking's second son, who subsequently became Henry VIII. The king's\r\ndaughter Margaret was married to King James IV of Scotland, thereby\r\npaving the way much later for the union of the crowns of England and\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nEngland in the year 1500 was a real national monarchy, and the power of\r\nthe king appeared to be distinctly in the ascendant. Parliament was\r\nfast becoming a purely formal and perfunctory body.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The French Monarchy]\r\n\r\nBy the year 1500 the French monarchy was largely consolidated\r\nterritorially and politically. It had been a slow and painful process,\r\nfor long ago in 987, when Hugh Capet came to the throne, the France of\r\nhis day was hardly more than the neighborhood of Paris, and it had\r\ntaken five full centuries to unite the petty feudal divisions of the\r\ncountry into the great centralized state which we call France. The\r\nHundred Years' War had finally freed the western duchies and counties\r\nfrom English control. Just before the opening of the sixteenth century\r\nthe wily and tactful Louis XI (1461-1483) had rounded out French\r\nterritories: on the east he had occupied the powerful duchy of\r\nBurgundy; on the west and on the southeast he had possessed himself of\r\nmost of the great inheritance of the Angevin branch of his own family,\r\nincluding Anjou, and Provence east of the Rhone; and on the south the\r\nFrench frontier had been carried to the Pyrenees. Finally, Louis's son,\r\nCharles VIII (1483-1498), by marrying the heiress of Brittany, had\r\nabsorbed that western duchy into France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Steady Growth of Royal Power in France]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, centralized political institutions had been taking slow but\r\ntenacious root in the country. Of course, many local institutions and\r\ncustoms survived in the various states which had been gradually added\r\nto France, but the king was now recognized from Flanders to Spain and\r\nfrom the Rhone to the Ocean as the source of law, justice, and order.\r\nThere was a uniform royal coinage and a standing army under the king's\r\ncommand. The monarchs had struggled valiantly against the disruptive\r\ntendencies of feudalism; they had been aided by the commoners or middle\r\nclass; and the proof of their success was their comparative freedom\r\nfrom political checks. The Estates-General, to which French commoners\r\nhad been admitted in 1302, resembled in certain externals the English\r\nParliament,--for example, in comprising representatives of the clergy,\r\nnobles, and commons,--but it had never had final say in levying taxes\r\nor in authorizing expenditures or in trying royal officers. And unlike\r\nEngland, there was in France no live tradition of popular participation\r\nin government and no written guarantee of personal liberty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foreign Relations of the French Kings about 1500]\r\n\r\nConsolidated at home in territory and in government, Frenchmen began\r\nabout the year 1500 to be attracted to questions of external policy. By\r\nattempting to enforce an inherited claim to the crown of Naples,\r\nCharles VIII in 1494 started that career of foreign war and\r\naggrandizement which was to mark the history of France throughout\r\nfollowing centuries. His efforts in Italy were far from successful, but\r\nhis heir, Louis XII (1498-1515), continued to lay claim to Naples and\r\nto the duchy of Milan as well. In 1504 Louis was obliged to resign\r\nNaples to King Ferdinand of Aragon, in whose family it remained for two\r\ncenturies, but about Milan continued a conflict, with varying fortunes,\r\nultimately merging into the general struggle between Francis I (1515-\r\n1547) and the Emperor Charles V.\r\n\r\nFrance in the year 1500 was a real national monarchy, with the\r\nbeginnings of a national literature and with a national patriotism\r\ncentering in the king. It was becoming self-conscious. Like England,\r\nFrance was on the road to one-man power, but unlike England, the way\r\nhad been marked by no liberal or constitutional mile-posts.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPAIN AND PORTUGAL\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Development of the Spanish and Portuguese Monarchies]\r\n\r\nSouth of the Pyrenees were the Spanish and Portuguese monarchies,\r\nwhich, in a long process of unification, not only had to contend\r\nagainst the same disuniting tendencies as appeared in France and\r\nEngland, but also had to solve the problem of the existence side by\r\nside of two great rival religions--Christianity and Mohammedanism.\r\nMohammedan invaders from Africa had secured political control of nearly\r\nthe whole peninsula as early as the eighth century, but in course of\r\ntime there appeared in the northern and western mountains several\r\ndiminutive Christian states, of which the following may be mentioned:\r\nBarcelona, in the northeast, along the Mediterranean; Aragon, occupying\r\nthe south-central portion of the Pyrenees and extending southward\r\ntoward the Ebro River; Navarre, at the west of the Pyrenees, reaching\r\nnorthward into what is now France and southward into what is now Spain;\r\nCastile, west of Navarre, circling about the town of Burgos; Leon, in\r\nthe northwestern corner of the peninsula; and Portugal, south of Leon,\r\nlying along the Atlantic coast. Little by little these Christian states\r\nextended their southern frontiers at the expense of the Mohammedan\r\npower and showed some disposition to combine. In the twelfth century\r\nBarcelona was united with the kingdom of Aragon, and a hundred years\r\nlater Castile and Leon were finally joined. Thus, by the close of the\r\nthirteenth century, there were three important states in the peninsula\r\n--Aragon on the east, Castile in the center, and Portugal on the west--\r\nand two less important states--Christian Navarre in the extreme north,\r\nand Mohammedan Granada in the extreme south.\r\n\r\nWhile Portugal acquired its full territorial extension in the peninsula\r\nby the year 1263, the unity of modern Spain was delayed until after the\r\nmarriage of Ferdinand (1479-1516) and Isabella (1474-1504), sovereigns\r\nrespectively of Aragon and Castile. Granada, the last foothold of the\r\nMohammedans, fell in 1492, and in 1512 Ferdinand acquired that part of\r\nthe ancient kingdom of Navarre which lay upon the southern slope of the\r\nPyrenees. The peninsula was henceforth divided between the two modern\r\nstates of Spain and Portugal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Portugal a Real National Monarchy in 1500]\r\n\r\nPortugal, the older and smaller of the two states, had become a\r\nconspicuous member of the family of nations by the year 1500, thanks to\r\na line of able kings and to the remarkable series of foreign\r\ndiscoveries that cluster about the name of Prince Henry the Navigator.\r\nPortugal possessed a distinctive language of Latin origin and already\r\ncherished a literature of no mean proportions. In harmony with the\r\nspirit of the age the monarchy was tending toward absolutism, and the\r\nparliament, called the Cortes, which had played an important part in\r\nearlier times, ceased to meet regularly after 1521. The Portuguese\r\nroyal family were closely related to the Castilian line, and there were\r\npeople in both kingdoms who hoped that one day the whole peninsula\r\nwould be united under one sovereign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Spanish Kingdom in 1500]\r\n\r\nFrom several standpoints the Spanish monarchy was less unified in 1500\r\nthan England, France, or Portugal. The union of Castile and Aragon was,\r\nfor over two centuries, hardly more than personal. Each retained its\r\nown customs, parliaments (Cortes), and separate administration. Each\r\npossessed a distinctive language, although Castilian gradually became\r\nthe literary \"Spanish,\" while Catalan, the speech of Aragon, was\r\nreduced to the position of an inferior. Despite the continuance of\r\nexcessive pride in local traditions and institutions, the cause of\r\nSpanish nationality received great impetus during the reign of\r\nFerdinand and Isabella. It was under them that territorial unity had\r\nbeen obtained. It was they who turned the attention of Spaniards to\r\nforeign and colonial enterprises. The year that marked the fall of\r\nGranada and the final extinction of Mohammedan power in Spain was\r\nlikewise signalized by the first voyage of Christopher Columbus, which\r\nprefigured the establishment of a greater Spain beyond the seas. On the\r\ncontinent of Europe, Spain speedily acquired a commanding position in\r\ninternational affairs, as the result largely of Ferdinand's ability.\r\nThe royal house of Aragon had long held claims to the Neapolitan and\r\nSicilian kingdoms and for two hundred years had freely mixed in the\r\npolitics of Italy. Now, in 1504, Ferdinand definitely secured\r\nrecognition from France of his rights in Naples, Sicily, and Sardinia.\r\nSpain was becoming the rival of Venice for the leadership of the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Increase of Royal Power in Spain under Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella]\r\n\r\nWhile interfering very little with the forms of representative\r\ngovernment in their respective kingdoms, Ferdinand and Isabella worked\r\never, in fact, toward uniformity and absolutism. They sought to\r\ningratiate themselves with the middle class, to strip the nobility of\r\nits political influence, and to enlist the church in their service. The\r\nCortes were more or less regularly convened, but their functions were\r\nalmost imperceptibly transferred to royal commissions and officers of\r\nstate. Privileges granted to towns in earlier times were now gradually\r\nrevoked. The king, by becoming the head of the ancient military orders\r\nwhich had borne prominent part in the struggle against the Mohammedans,\r\neasily gained control of considerable treasure and of an effective\r\nfighting force. The sovereigns prevailed upon the pope to transfer\r\ncontrol of the Inquisition, the medieval ecclesiastical tribunal for\r\nthe trial of heretics, to the crown, so that the harsh penalties which\r\nwere to be inflicted for many years upon dissenters from orthodox\r\nChristianity were due not only to religious bigotry but likewise to the\r\ndesire for political uniformity.\r\n\r\nIn population and in domestic resources Spain was not so important as\r\nFrance, but the exploits of Ferdinand and Isabella, the great wealth\r\nwhich temporarily flowed to her from the colonies, the prestige which\r\nlong attended her diplomacy and her armies, were to exalt the Spanish\r\nmonarchy throughout the sixteenth century to a position quite out of\r\nkeeping with her true importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE OLD HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Idea of an \"Empire\" Different in 1500 from that of a\r\n\"National Monarchy\"]\r\n\r\nThe national monarchies of western Europe--England, France, Spain, and\r\nPortugal--were political novelties in the year 1500: the idea of\r\nuniting the people of similar language and customs under a strongly\r\ncentralized state had been slowly developing but had not reached\r\nfruition much before that date. On the other hand, in central Europe\r\nsurvived in weakness an entirely different kind of state, called an\r\nempire. The theory of an empire was a very ancient one--it meant a\r\nstate which should embrace all peoples of whatsoever race or language,\r\nbound together in obedience to a common prince. Such, for example, had\r\nbeen the ideal of the old Roman Empire, under whose Caesars practically\r\nthe whole civilized world had once been joined, so that the inhabitant\r\nof Egypt or Armenia united with the citizen of Britain or Spain in\r\nallegiance to the emperor. That empire retained its hold on portions of\r\neastern Europe until its final conquest by the Ottoman Turks in 1453,\r\nbut a thousand years earlier it had lost control of the West because of\r\nexternal violence and internal weakness. So great, however, was the\r\nstrength of the idea of an \"empire,\" even in the West, that Charlemagne\r\nabout the year 800 temporarily united what are now France, Germany,\r\nItaly, the Netherlands, and Belgium into what he persisted in styling\r\nthe \"Roman Empire.\" Nearly two centuries later, Otto the Great, a\r\nfamous prince in Germany, gave other form to the idea, in the \"Holy\r\nRoman Empire\" of which he became emperor. This form endured from 962 to\r\n1806.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Holy Roman Empire; Its Mighty Claims in Theory and its\r\nSlight Power in Practice]\r\n\r\nIn theory, the Holy Roman Empire claimed supremacy over all Christian\r\nrulers and peoples of central and western Europe, and after the\r\nextinction of the eastern empire in 1453 it could insist that it was\r\nthe sole secular heir to the ancient Roman tradition. But the greatness\r\nof the theoretical claim of the Holy Roman Empire was matched only by\r\nthe insignificance of its practical acceptance. The feudal nobles of\r\nwestern Europe had never recognized it, and the national monarchs,\r\nthough they might occasionally sport with its honors and titles, never\r\nadmitted any real dependence upon it of England, France, Portugal, or\r\nSpain. In central Europe, it had to struggle against the anarchical\r\ntendencies of feudalism, against the rise of powerful and jealous city-\r\nstates, and against a rival organization, the Catholic Church, which in\r\nits temporal affairs was at least as clearly an heir to the Roman\r\ntradition as was the Holy Roman Empire. From the eleventh to the\r\nthirteenth century the conflict raged, with results important for all\r\nconcerned,--results which were thoroughly obvious in the year 1500.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Holy Roman Empire practically Restricted by 1500 to the\r\nGermanies]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the Holy Roman Empire was practically restricted to\r\nGerman-speaking peoples. The papacy and the Italian cities had been\r\nfreed from imperial control, and both the Netherlands--that is, Holland\r\nand Belgium--and the Swiss cantons were only nominally connected. Over\r\nthe Slavic people to the east--Russians, Poles, etc.--or the\r\nScandinavians to the north, the empire had secured comparatively small\r\ninfluence. By the year 1500 the words Empire and Germany had become\r\nvirtually interchangeable terms.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there was throughout central Europe no conspicuous desire for\r\nstrong centralized national states, such as prevailed in western\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Internal Weakness of the Holy Roman Empire]\r\n\r\nSeparatism was the rule. In Italy and in the Netherlands the city-\r\nstates were the political units. Within the Holy Roman Empire was a\r\nvast hodge-podge of city-states, and feudal survivals--arch-duchies,\r\nsuch as Austria; margravates, such as Brandenburg; duchies, like\r\nSaxony, Bavaria, and Württemberg; counties like the Palatinate, and a\r\nhost of free cities, baronies, and domains, some of them smaller than\r\nan American township. In all there were over three hundred states which\r\ncollectively were called \"the Germanies\" and which were united only by\r\nthe slender imperial thread. The idea of empire had not only been\r\nnarrowed to one nation; it also, in its failure to overcome feudalism,\r\nhad prevented the growth of a real national monarchy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Government of the Holy Roman Empire]\r\n\r\nWhat was the nature of this slight tie that nominally held the\r\nGermanies together? There was the form of a central government with an\r\nemperor to execute laws and a Diet to make them. The emperor was not\r\nnecessarily hereditary but was chosen by seven \"electors,\" who were the\r\nchief princes of the realm. These seven were the archbishops of Mainz\r\n(Mayence), of Cologne, and of Trier (Trèves), the king of Bohemia, the\r\nduke of Saxony, the margrave of Brandenburg, and the count palatine of\r\nthe Rhine. Not infrequently the electors used their position to extort\r\nconcessions from the emperor elect which helped to destroy German unity\r\nand to promote the selfish interests of the princes. The imperial Diet\r\nwas composed of the seven electors, the lesser princes (including the\r\nhigher ecclesiastical dignitaries, such as bishops and abbots), and\r\nrepresentatives of the free cities, grouped in three separate houses.\r\nThe emperor was not supposed to perform any imperial act without the\r\nauthorization of the Diet, and petty jealousies between its members or\r\nhouses often prevented action in the Diet. The individual states,\r\nmoreover, reserved to themselves the management of most affairs which\r\nin western Europe had been surrendered to the central national\r\ngovernment. The Diet, and therefore the emperor, was without a treasury\r\nor an army, unless the individual states saw fit to act favorably upon\r\nits advice and furnish the requested quotas. The Diet resembled far\r\nmore a congress of diplomats than a legislative body.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Habsburgs: Weak as Emperors but Strong as Rulers of\r\nParticular States within the Holy Roman Empire]\r\n\r\nIt will be readily perceived that under these circumstances the emperor\r\nas such could have little influence. Yet the fear of impending Slavic\r\nor Turkish attacks upon the eastern frontier, or other fears,\r\nfrequently operated to secure the election of some prince who had\r\nsufficiently strong power of his own to stay the attack or remove the\r\nfear. In this way, Rudolph, count of Habsburg, had been chosen emperor\r\nin 1273, and in his family, with few interruptions, continued the\r\nimperial title, not only to 1500 but to the final extinction of the\r\nempire in 1806. Several of these Habsburg emperors were influential,\r\nbut it must always be remembered that they owed their power not to the\r\nempire but to their own hereditary states.\r\n\r\nOriginally lords of a small district in Switzerland, the Habsburgs had\r\ngradually increased their holdings until at length in 1273 Rudolph, the\r\nmaker of his family's real fortunes, had been chosen Holy Roman\r\nEmperor, and three years later had conquered the valuable archduchy of\r\nAustria with its capital of Vienna. The family subsequently became\r\nrelated by marriage to reigning families in Hungary and in Italy as\r\nwell as in Bohemia and other states of the empire. In 1477 the Emperor\r\nMaximilian I (1493-1519) married Mary of Burgundy, daughter of Charles\r\nthe Bold and heiress of the wealthy provinces of the Netherlands; and\r\nin 1496 his son Philip was united to Joanna, the daughter of Ferdinand\r\nand Isabella and heiress of the crowns of Castile and Aragon. The\r\nfortunes of the Habsburgs were decidedly auspicious.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vain Attempts to \"Reform\" the Holy Roman Empire]\r\n\r\nOf course, signs were not wanting of some national life in the\r\nGermanies. Most of the people spoke a common language; a form of\r\nnational unity existed in the Diet; and many patriots raised their\r\nvoice in behalf of a stronger and more centralized government. In 1495\r\na Diet met at the city of Worms to discuss with Emperor Maximilian\r\nprojects of reform. After protracted debates, it was agreed that\r\nprivate warfare, a survival of feudal days, should be abolished; a\r\nperpetual peace should be declared; and an imperial court should be\r\nestablished to settle all disputes between states within the empire.\r\nThese efforts at reform, like many before and after, were largely\r\nunfruitful, and, despite occasional protests, practical disunion\r\nprevailed in the Germanies of the sixteenth century, albeit under the\r\nhigh-sounding title of \"Holy Roman Empire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n3. THE CITY-STATES\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"City-States\" in 1500]\r\n\r\nBefore the dawn of the Christian era the Greeks and Romans had\r\nentertained a general idea of political organization which would seem\r\nstrange to most of us at the present time. They believed that every\r\ncity with its outlying country should constitute an independent state,\r\nwith its own particular law-making and governing bodies, army, coinage,\r\nand foreign relations. To them, the idea of an empire was intolerable\r\nand the concept of a national state, such as we commonly have to-day,\r\nunthinkable.\r\n\r\nNow it so happened, as we shall see in the following chapter, that the\r\ncommerce of the middle ages stimulated the growth of important trading\r\ntowns in Italy, in Germany, and in the Netherlands. These towns, in one\r\nway or another, managed to secure a large measure of self-government,\r\nso that by the year 1500 they had become somewhat similar to the city-\r\nstates of antiquity. In Germany, though they still maintained their\r\nlocal self-government, they were loosely attached to the Holy Roman\r\nEmpire and were overshadowed in political influence by other states. In\r\nthe case of Italy and of the Netherlands, however, it is impossible to\r\nunderstand the politics of those countries in the sixteenth century\r\nwithout paying some attention to city-states, which played leading\r\nrôles in both.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Italy in 1500 neither a National Monarchy not Attached to\r\nthe Holy Roman Empire]\r\n\r\nIn the Italy of the year 1500 there was not even the semblance of\r\nnational political unity. Despite the ardent longings of many Italian\r\npatriots [Footnote: Of such patriots was Machiavelli (see below, p.\r\n194). Machiavelli wrote in _The Prince:_ \"Our country, left almost\r\nwithout life, still waits to know who it is that is to heal her\r\nbruises, to put an end to the devastation and plunder of Lombardy and\r\nto the exactions and imposts of Naples and Tuscany, and to stanch those\r\nwounds of hers which long neglect has changed into running sores. We\r\nsee how she prays God to send some one to rescue her from these\r\nbarbarous cruelties and oppressions. We see too how ready and eager she\r\nis to follow any standard, were there only some one to raise it.\"], and\r\nthe rise of a common language, which, under such masters as Dante and\r\nPetrarch, had become a great medium for literary expression, the people\r\nof the peninsula had not built up a national monarchy like those of\r\nwestern Europe nor had they even preserved the form of allegiance to\r\nthe Holy Roman Empire. This was due to several significant events of\r\nearlier times. In the first place, the attempt of the medieval German\r\nemperors to gain control of Italy not only had signally failed but had\r\nleft behind two contending factions throughout the whole country,--one,\r\nthe Ghibellines, supporting the doctrine of maintaining the traditional\r\nconnection with the Germanies; the other, the Guelphs, rejecting that\r\ndoctrine. In the second place, the pope, who exercised extensive\r\npolitical as well as religious power, felt that his ecclesiastical\r\ninfluence would be seriously impaired by the creation of political\r\nunity in the country; a strong lay monarch with a solid Italy behind\r\nhim would in time reduce the sovereign pontiff to a subservient\r\nposition and diminish the prestige which the head of the church enjoyed\r\nin foreign lands; therefore the popes participated actively in the game\r\nof Italian politics, always endeavoring to prevent any one state from\r\nbecoming too powerful. Thirdly, the comparatively early commercial\r\nprominence of the Italian towns had stimulated trade rivalries which\r\ntended to make each proud of its independence and wealth; and as the\r\ncities grew and prospered to an unwonted degree, it became increasingly\r\ndifficult to join them together. Finally, the riches of the Italians,\r\nand the local jealousies and strife, to say nothing of the papal\r\npolicy, marked the country as natural prey for foreign interference and\r\nconquest; and in this way the peninsula became a battleground for\r\nSpaniards, Frenchmen, and Germans.\r\n\r\nBefore reviewing the chief city-states of northern Italy, it will be\r\nwell to say a word about two other political divisions of the country.\r\nThe southern third of the peninsula comprised the ancient kingdom of\r\nNaples, which had grown up about the city of that name, and which\r\ntogether with the large island of Sicily, was called the kingdom of the\r\nTwo Sicilies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Southern Italy in 1500: the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]\r\n\r\nThis state, having been first formed by Scandinavian adventurers in the\r\neleventh century, had successively passed under papal suzerainty, under\r\nthe domination of the German emperors, and at length in 1266 under\r\nFrench control. A revolt in Sicily in the year 1282, commonly called\r\nthe Sicilian Vespers, had severed the relation between the island and\r\nthe mainland, the former passing to the royal family of Aragon, and the\r\nlatter troublously remaining in French hands until 1442. The reunion of\r\nthe Two Sicilies at that date under the crown of Aragon served to keep\r\nalive the quarrel between the French and the Spanish; and it was not\r\nuntil 1504 that the king of France definitely renounced his Neapolitan\r\nclaims in favor of Ferdinand of Aragon. Socially and politically Naples\r\nwas the most backward state in Italy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Italy in 1500: the Papal States]\r\n\r\nAbout the city of Rome had grown up in the course of centuries the\r\nPapal States, or as they were officially styled, the Patrimony of St.\r\nPeter. It had early fallen to the lot of the bishop, as the most\r\nimportant person in the city, to exercise political power over Rome,\r\nwhen barbarian invasions no longer permitted the exercise of authority\r\nby Roman emperors; and control over neighboring districts, as well as\r\nover the city, had been expressly recognized and conferred upon the\r\nbishop by Charlemagne in the eighth century. This bishop of Rome was,\r\nof course, the pope; and the pope slowly extended his territories\r\nthrough central Italy from the Tiber to the Adriatic, long using them\r\nmerely as a bulwark to his religious and ecclesiastical prerogatives.\r\nBy the year 1500, however, the popes were becoming prone to regard\r\nthemselves as Italian princes who might normally employ their states as\r\nso many pawns in the game of peninsular politics. The policy of the\r\nnotorious Alexander VI (1492-1503) centered in his desire to establish\r\nhis son, Cesare Borgia, as an Italian ruler; and Julius II (1503-1513)\r\nwas famed more for statecraft and military prowess than for religious\r\nfervor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The City-States of Northern Italy in 1500]\r\n\r\nNorth and west of the Papal States were the various city-states which\r\nwere so thoroughly distinctive of Italian politics at the opening of\r\nthe sixteenth century. Although these towns had probably reached a\r\nhigher plane both of material prosperity and of intellectual culture\r\nthan was to be found at that time in any other part of Europe,\r\nnevertheless they were deeply jealous of each other and carried on an\r\ninterminable series of petty wars, the brunt of which was borne by\r\nprofessional hired soldiers and freebooters styled _condottieri_.\r\nAmong the Italian city-states, the most famous in the year 1500 were\r\nMilan, Venice, Genoa, and Florence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Italian City-States: Milan Governed by Despots]\r\n\r\nOf these cities, Milan was still in theory a ducal fief of the Holy\r\nRoman Empire, but had long been in fact the prize of despotic rulers\r\nwho were descended from two famous families--the Visconti and the\r\nSforza--and who combined the patronage of art with the fine political\r\nsubtleties of Italian tyrants. The Visconti ruled Milan from the\r\nthirteenth century to the middle of the fifteenth, when a Sforza, a\r\nleader of _condottieri_ established the supremacy of his own\r\nfamily. In 1499, however, King Louis XII of France, claiming the duchy\r\nas heir to the Visconti, seized Milan and held it until he was expelled\r\nin 1512 by the Holy League, composed of the pope, Venice, Spain, and\r\nEngland, and a Sforza was temporarily reinstated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Venice, a Type of the Commercial and Aristocratic Italian\r\nCity-States]\r\n\r\nAs Milan was the type of Italian city ruled by a despot or tyrant, so\r\nVenice was a type of the commercial, oligarchical city-states. Venice\r\nwas by far the most powerful state in the peninsula. Located on the\r\nislands and lagoons at the head of the Adriatic, she had profited\r\ngreatly by the crusades to build up a maritime empire and an enviable\r\ntrade on the eastern Mediterranean and had extended her sway over rich\r\nlands in the northeastern part of Italy. In the year 1500, Venice\r\nboasted 3000 ships, 300,000 sailors, a numerous and veteran army,\r\nfamous factories of plate glass, silk stuffs, and gold and silver\r\nobjects, and a singularly strong government. Nominally Venice was a\r\nrepublic, but actually an oligarchy. Political power was intrusted\r\njointly to several agencies: (1) a grand council controlled by the\r\ncommercial magnates; (2) a centralized committee of ten; (3) an elected\r\ndoge, or duke; and (4), after 1454, three state inquisitors, henceforth\r\nthe city's real masters. The inquisitors could pronounce sentence of\r\ndeath, dispose of the public funds, and enact statutes; they maintained\r\na regular spy system; and trial, judgment, and execution were secret.\r\nThe mouth of the lion of St. Mark received anonymous denunciations, and\r\nthe waves which passed under the Bridge of Sighs carried away the\r\ncorpses. To this regime Venice owed an internal peace which contrasted\r\nwith the endless civil wars of the other Italian cities. Till the final\r\ndestruction of the state in 1798 Venice knew no political revolution.\r\nIn foreign affairs, also, Venice possessed considerable influence; she\r\nwas the first European state to send regular envoys, or ambassadors, to\r\nother courts. It seemed in 1500 as if she were particularly wealthy and\r\ngreat, but already had been sowed the seed of her subsequent decline\r\nand humiliation. The advance of the Ottoman Turks threatened her\r\nposition in eastern Europe, although she still held the Morea in\r\nGreece, Crete, Cyprus, and many Ionian and Ægean islands. The discovery\r\nof America and of a new route to India was destined to shake the very\r\nbasis of her commercial supremacy. And her unscrupulous policy toward\r\nher Italian rivals lost her friends to the west. So great was the\r\nenmity against Venice that the formidable League of Cambrai, entered\r\ninto by the emperor, the pope, France, and Spain in 1508, wrung many\r\nconcessions from her.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Genoa]\r\n\r\nSecond only to Venice in commercial importance, Genoa, in marked\r\ncontrast with her rival, passed through all manner of political\r\nvicissitudes until in 1499 she fell prey to the invasion of King Louis\r\nXII of France. Thereafter Genoa remained some years subject to the\r\nFrench, but in 1528 the resolution of an able citizen, Andrea Doria,\r\nfreed the state from foreign invaders and restored to Genoa her\r\nrepublican institutions.\r\n\r\nThe famed city-state of Florence may be taken as the best type of the\r\ndemocratic community, controlled by a political leader. The city, as\r\nfamous for its free institutions as for its art, in the first half of\r\nthe fifteenth century had come under the tutelage of a family of\r\ntraders and bankers, the wealthy Medici, who preserved the republican\r\nforms, and for a while, under Lorenzo de' Medici (1449-1492), surnamed\r\nthe Magnificent, made Florence the center of Italian culture and\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Florence, a Type of the Cultured and Democratic Italian\r\nCity-State]\r\n\r\nSoon after the death of Lorenzo, a democratic reaction took place under\r\nan enthusiastic and puritanical monk, Savonarola, who welcomed the\r\nadvent of the French king, Charles VIII, in 1494, and aided materially\r\nin the expulsion of the Medici. Savonarola soon fell a victim to the\r\nplots of his Florentine enemies and to the vengeance of the pope, whom\r\nCharles VIII had offended, and was put to death in 1498, The democracy\r\nmanaged to survive until 1512 when the Medici returned. The city-state\r\nof Florence subsequently became the grand-duchy of Tuscany.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Obscure Duchy of Savoy in 1500]\r\n\r\nBefore we take leave of the Italian states of the year 1500, mention\r\nshould be made of the insignificant duchy of Savoy, tucked away in the\r\nfastnesses of the northwestern Alps, whose duke, after varying\r\nfortunes, was to become, in the nineteenth century, king of a united\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The City-States in the Netherlands]\r\n\r\nThe city-state was the dominant form of political organization not only\r\nin Italy but also in the Netherlands. The Netherlands, or the Low\r\nCountries, were seventeen provinces occupying the flat lowlands along\r\nthe North Sea,--the Holland, Belgium, and northern France of our own\r\nday. Most of the inhabitants, Flemings and Dutch, spoke a language akin\r\nto German, but in the south the Walloons used a French dialect. At\r\nfirst the provinces had been mere feudal states at the mercy of various\r\nwarring noblemen, but gradually in the course of the twelfth,\r\nthirteenth, and fourteenth centuries, important towns had arisen so\r\nwealthy and populous that they were able to wrest charters from the\r\nlords. Thus arose a number of municipalities--practically self-\r\ngoverning republics--semi-independent vassals of feudal nobles; and in\r\nmany cases the early oligarchic systems of municipal government\r\nspeedily gave way to more democratic institutions. Remarkable in\r\nindustry and prosperity were Ghent, Bruges, Antwerp, Brussels, Liege,\r\nUtrecht, Delft, Rotterdam, and many another.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relation of the City-Stats of the Netherlands to the Dukes\r\nof Burgundy]\r\n\r\nBeginning in 1384 and continuing throughout the fifteenth century, the\r\ndukes of Burgundy, who as vassals of the French king had long held the\r\nduchy of that name in eastern France, succeeded by marriage, purchase,\r\ntreachery, or force in bringing one by one the seventeen provinces of\r\nthe Netherlands under their rule. This extension of dominion on the\r\npart of the dukes of Burgundy implied the establishment of a strong\r\nmonarchical authority, which was supported by the nobility and clergy\r\nand opposed by the cities. In 1465 a common parliament, called the\r\nStates General, was constituted at Brussels, containing deputies from\r\neach of the seventeen provinces; and eight years later a grand council\r\nwas organized with supreme judicial and financial functions. Charles\r\nthe Bold, who died in 1477, was prevented from constructing a great\r\ncentral kingdom between France and the Germanies only by the shrewdness\r\nof his implacable foe, King Louis XI of France. As we have seen, in\r\nanother connection, Louis seized the duchy of Burgundy on the death of\r\nCharles the Bold, thereby extending the eastern frontier of France, but\r\nthe duke's inheritance in the Netherlands passed to his daughter Mary.\r\nIn 1477 Mary's marriage with Maximilian of Austria began the long\r\ndomination of the Netherlands by the house of Habsburg.\r\n\r\nThroughout these political changes, the towns of the Netherlands\r\nmaintained many of their former privileges, and their prosperity\r\nsteadily increased. The country became the richest in Europe, and the\r\nsplendor of the ducal court surpassed that of any contemporary\r\nsovereign. A permanent memorial of it remains in the celebrated Order\r\nof the Golden Fleece, which was instituted by the duke of Burgundy in\r\nthe fifteenth century and was so named from the English wool, the raw\r\nmaterial used in the Flemish looms and the very foundation of the\r\ncountry's fortunes.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. NORTHERN AND EASTERN EUROPE IN THE YEAR 1500\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Northern and Eastern Europe of Small Importance in the\r\nSixteenth Century, but of Great Importance Subsequently]\r\n\r\nWe have now reviewed the states that were to be the main factors in the\r\nhistorical events of the sixteenth century--the national monarchies of\r\nEngland, France, Portugal, and Spain; the Holy Roman Empire of the\r\nGermanies; and the city-states of Italy and the Netherlands. It may be\r\nwell, however, to point out that in northern and eastern Europe other\r\nstates had already come into existence, which subsequently were to\r\naffect in no small degree the history of modern times, such as the\r\nScandinavian kingdoms, the tsardom of Muscovy, the feudal kingdoms of\r\nPoland and Hungary, and the empire of the Ottoman Turks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Northwestern Europe: the Scandinavian Countries]\r\n\r\nIn the early homes of those Northmen who had long before ravaged the\r\ncoasts of England and France and southern Italy and had colonized\r\nIceland and Greenland, were situated in 1500 three kingdoms, Denmark,\r\nNorway, and Sweden, corresponding generally to the present-day states\r\nof those names. The three countries had many racial and social\r\ncharacteristics in common, and they had been politically joined under\r\nthe king of Denmark by the Union of Calmar in 1397. This union never\r\nevoked any popularity among the Swedes, and after a series of revolts\r\nand disorders extending over fifty years, Gustavus Vasa (1523-1560)\r\nestablished the independence of Sweden. Norway remained under Danish\r\nkings until 1814.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Slavs in Central and Eastern Europe]\r\n\r\nEast of the Scandinavian peninsula and of the German-speaking\r\npopulation of central Europe, spread out like a great fan, are a\r\nvariety of peoples who possess many common characteristics, including a\r\ngroup of closely related languages, which are called Slavic. These\r\nSlavs in the year 1500 included (1) the Russians, (2) the Poles and\r\nLithuanians, (3) the Czechs, or natives of Bohemia, within the confines\r\nof the Holy Roman Empire, and (4) various nations in southeastern\r\nEurope, such as the Serbs and Bulgars.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russia in 1500]\r\n\r\nThe Russians in 1500 did not possess such a huge autocratic state as\r\nthey do to-day. They were distributed among several principalities, the\r\nchief and center of which was the grand-duchy of Muscovy, with Moscow\r\nas its capital. Muscovy's reigning family was of Scandinavian\r\nextraction but what civilization and Christianity the principalities\r\npossessed had been brought by Greek missionaries from Constantinople.\r\nFor two centuries, from the middle of the thirteenth to the middle of\r\nthe fifteenth, the Russians paid tribute to Mongol [Footnote: The\r\nMongols were a people of central Asia, whose famous leader, Jenghiz\r\nKhan (1162-1227), established an empire which stretched from the China\r\nSea to the banks of the Dnieper. It was these Mongols who drove the\r\nOttoman Turks from their original Asiatic home and thus precipitated\r\nthe Turkish invasion of Europe. After the death of Jenghiz Khan the\r\nMongol Empire was broken into a variety of \"khanates,\" all of which in\r\ncourse of time dwindled away. In the sixteenth century the Mongols\r\nnorth of the Black Sea succumbed to the Turks as well as to the\r\nRussians.] khans who had set up an Asiatic despotism north of the Black\r\nSea. The beginnings of Russian greatness are traceable to Ivan III, the\r\nGreat (1462-1505), [Footnote: Ivan IV (1533-1584), called \"The\r\nTerrible,\" a successor of Ivan III, assumed the title of \"Tsar\" in\r\n1547.] who freed his people from Mongol domination, united the numerous\r\nprincipalities, conquered the important cities of Novgorod and Pskov,\r\nand extended his sway as far as the Arctic Ocean and the Ural\r\nMountains. Russia, however, could hardly then be called a modern state,\r\nfor the political and social life still smacked of Asia rather than of\r\nEurope, and the Russian Christianity, having been derived from\r\nConstantinople, differed from the Christianity of western Europe.\r\nRussia was not to appear as a conspicuous European state until the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Poland in 1500]\r\n\r\nSouthwest of the tsardom of Muscovy and east of the Holy Roman Empire\r\nwas the kingdom of Poland, to which Lithuanians as well as Poles owed\r\nallegiance. Despite wide territories and a succession of able rulers,\r\nPoland was a weak monarchy. Lack of natural boundaries made national\r\ndefense difficult. Civil war between the two peoples who composed the\r\nstate and foreign war with the neighboring Germans worked havoc and\r\ndistress. An obstructive parliament of great lords rendered effective\r\nadministration impossible. The nobles possessed the property and\r\ncontrolled politics; in their hands the king gradually became a puppet.\r\nPoland seemed committed to feudal society and feudal government at the\r\nvery time when the countries of western Europe were ridding themselves\r\nof such checks upon the free growth of centralized national states.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hungary in 1500]\r\n\r\nSomewhat similar to Poland in its feudal propensities was the kingdom\r\nof Hungary, which an invasion of Asiatic tribesmen [Footnote:\r\nHungarians, or Magyars--different names for the same people.] in the\r\ntenth century had driven like a wedge between the Slavs of the Balkan\r\npeninsula and those of the north Poles and Russians. At first, the\r\nefforts of such kings as St. Stephen (997-1038) promised the\r\ndevelopment of a great state, but the weakness of the sovereigns in the\r\nthirteenth century, the infiltration of western feudalism, and the\r\nendless civil discords brought to the front a powerful and predatory\r\nclass of barons who ultimately overshadowed the throne. The brilliant\r\nreign of Matthias Hunyadi (1458-1490) was but an exception to the\r\ngeneral rule. Not only were the kings obliged to struggle against the\r\nnobles for their very existence--the crown was elective in Hungary--but\r\nno rulers had to contend with more or greater enemies on their\r\nfrontiers. To the north there was perpetual conflict with the Habsburgs\r\nof German Austria and with the forces of the Holy Roman Empire; to the\r\neast there were spasmodic quarrels with the Vlachs, the natives of\r\nmodern Rumania; to the south there was continual fighting, at first\r\nwith the Greeks and the Slavs--Serbs and Bulgars, and later, most\r\nterrible of all, with the Ottoman Turks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ottoman Turks in 1500]\r\n\r\nTo the Eastern Roman Empire, with Constantinople as its capital, and\r\nwith the Greeks as its dominant population, and to the medieval\r\nkingdoms of the Bulgars and Serbs, had succeeded by the year 1500 the\r\nempire of the Ottoman Turks. The Ottoman Turks were a tribe of Asiatic\r\nMohammedans who took their name from a certain Othman (died 1326),\r\nunder whom they had established themselves in Asia Minor, across the\r\nBosphorus from Constantinople. Thence they rapidly extended their\r\ndominion over Syria, and over Greece and the Balkan peninsula, except\r\nthe little mountain state of Montenegro, and in 1453 they captured\r\nConstantinople. The lands conquered by the arms of the Turks were\r\ndivided into large estates for the military leaders, or else assigned\r\nto the maintenance of mosques and schools, or converted into common and\r\npasturage lands; the conquered Christians were reduced to the payment\r\nof tribute and a life of serfdom. For two centuries the Turks were to\r\nremain a source of grave apprehension to Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL READINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL MONARCHIES ABOUT 1600. A. F.

Experienced\r\nmariners, and even learned geographers, were quite unaware that beyond\r\nthe Western Sea lay two great continents peopled by red men; of Africa\r\nthey knew only the northern coast; and in respect of Asia a thousand\r\nabsurd tales passed current. The unexplored waste of waters that\r\nconstituted the Atlantic Ocean was, to many ignorant Europeans of the\r\nfifteenth century, a terrible region frequented by fierce and fantastic\r\nmonsters. To the average European the countries surveyed in the\r\npreceding chapter, together with their Mohammedan neighbors across the\r\nMediterranean, still comprised the entire known world.\r\n\r\nShortly before the close of the fifteenth century, daring captains\r\nbegan to direct long voyages on the high seas and to discover the\r\nexistence of new lands; and from that time to the present, Europeans\r\nhave been busily exploring and conquering--veritably \"Europeanizing\"--\r\nthe whole globe. Although religion as well as commerce played an\r\nimportant role in promoting the process, the movement was attended from\r\nthe very outset by so startling a transformation in the routes,\r\nmethods, and commodities of trade that usually it has been styled the\r\nCommercial Revolution. By the close of the sixteenth century it had\r\nproceeded far enough to indicate that its results would rank among the\r\nmost fateful events of all history.\r\n\r\nIt was in the commonplace affairs of everyday life that the Commercial\r\nRevolution was destined to produce its most far-reaching results. To\r\nappreciate, therefore, its true nature and significance, we must first\r\nturn aside to ascertain how our European ancestors actually lived about\r\nthe year 1500, and what work they did to earn their living. Then, after\r\nrecounting the story of foreign exploration and colonization, we shall\r\nbe in a position to reappraise the domestic situation in town and on\r\nthe farm.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Differences between Sixteenth-century Farming and That of\r\nTo-day]\r\n\r\nAgriculture has always been the ultimate basis of society, but in the\r\nsixteenth century it was of greater relative importance than it is now.\r\nPeople then reckoned their wealth, not by the quantity of stocks and\r\nbonds they held, but by the extent of land they owned. Farming was\r\nstill the occupation of the vast majority of the population of every\r\nEuropean state, for the towns were as yet small in size and few in\r\nnumber. The \"masses\" lived in the country, not, as to-day, in the city.\r\n\r\nA twentieth-century observer would be struck by other peculiarities of\r\nsixteenth-century agriculture. He would find a curious organization of\r\nrural society, strange theories of land-ownership, and most unfamiliar\r\nmethods of tillage. He would discover, moreover, that practically each\r\nfarm was self-sufficing, producing only what its own occupants could\r\nconsume, and that consequently there was comparatively little external\r\ntrade in farm produce. From these facts he would readily understand\r\nthat the rural communities in the year 1500, numerous yet isolated,\r\nwere invulnerable strongholds of conservatism and ignorance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Two Rural Classes: Nobility and Peasantry]\r\n\r\nIn certain respects a remarkable uniformity prevailed in rural\r\ndistricts throughout all Europe. Whether one visited Germany, Hungary,\r\nFrance, or England, one was sure to find the agricultural population\r\nsharply divided into two social classes--nobility and peasantry. There\r\nmight be varying gradations of these classes in different regions, but\r\ncertain general distinctions everywhere prevailed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Nobility]\r\n\r\nThe nobility [Footnote: As a part of the nobility must be included at\r\nthe opening of the sixteenth century many of the higher clergy of the\r\nCatholic Church--archbishops, bishops, and abbots--who owned large\r\nlanded estates quite like their lay brethren.] comprised men who gained\r\na living from the soil without manual labor. They held the land on\r\nfeudal tenure, that is to say, they had a right to be supported by the\r\npeasants living on their estates, and, in return, they owed to some\r\nhigher or wealthier nobleman or to the king certain duties, such as\r\nfighting for him, [Footnote: This obligation rested only upon lay\r\nnoblemen, not upon ecclesiastics.] attending his court at specified\r\ntimes, and paying him various irregular taxes (the feudal dues). The\r\nestate of each nobleman might embrace a single farm, or \"manor\" as it\r\nwas called, inclosing a petty hamlet, or village; or it might include\r\ndozens of such manors; or, if the landlord were a particularly mighty\r\nmagnate or powerful prelate, it might stretch over whole counties.\r\n\r\nEach nobleman had his manor-house or, if he were rich enough, his\r\ncastle, lording it over the humble thatch-roofed cottages of the\r\nvillagers. In his stables were spirited horses and a carriage adorned\r\nwith his family crest; he had servants and lackeys, a footman to open\r\nhis carriage door, a game-warden to keep poachers from shooting his\r\ndeer, and men-at-arms to quell disturbances, to aid him against\r\nquarrelsome neighbors, or to follow him to the wars. While he lived, he\r\nmight occupy the best pew in the village church; when he died, he would\r\nbe laid to rest within the church where only noblemen were buried.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reason for the Preëminence of the Nobility]\r\n\r\nIn earlier times, when feudal society was young, the nobility had\r\nperformed a very real service as the defenders of the peasants against\r\nforeign enemies and likewise against marauders and bandits of whom the\r\nland had been full. Then fighting had been the profession of the\r\nnobility, And to enable them to possess the expensive accoutrements of\r\nfighting--horses, armor, swords, and lances--the kings and the peasants\r\nhad assured them liberal incomes.\r\n\r\nNow, however, at the opening of the sixteenth century, the palmy days\r\nof feudalism were past and gone. Later generations of noblemen,\r\nalthough they continued by right of inheritance to enjoy the financial\r\nincome and the social prestige which their forbears had earned, no\r\nlonger served king, country, or common people in the traditional\r\nmanner. At least in the national monarchies it was the king who now had\r\nundertaken the defense of the land and the preservation of peace; and\r\nthe nobleman, deprived of his old occupation, had little else to do\r\nthan to hunt, or quarrel with other noblemen, or engage in political\r\nintrigues. More and more the nobility, especially in France, were\r\nattracted to a life of amusement and luxury in the royal court. The\r\nnobility already had outlived its usefulness, yet it retained its old-\r\ntime privileges.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Peasantry]\r\n\r\nIn striking contrast to the nobility--the small minority of land-owning\r\naristocrats--were the peasantry--the mass of the people. They were the\r\nhuman beings who had to toil for their bread in the sweat of their\r\nbrows and who were deemed of ignoble birth, as social inferiors, and as\r\nstupid and rude. Actual farm work was \"servile labor,\" and between the\r\nman whose hands were stained by servile labor and the person of \"gentle\r\nbirth\" a wide gulf was fixed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Serfdom and the Manorial System]\r\n\r\nDuring the early middle ages most of the peasants throughout Europe\r\nwere \"serfs.\" For various reasons, which we shall explain presently,\r\nserfdom had tended gradually to and the die out in western Europe, but\r\nat the opening of the sixteenth century most of the agricultural\r\nlaborers in eastern and central Europe, and even a considerable number\r\nin France, were still serfs, living and working on nobles' manors in\r\naccordance with ancient customs which can be described collectively as\r\nthe \"manorial system.\"\r\n\r\nThe serf occupied a position in rural society which it is difficult for\r\nus to understand. He was not a slave, such as was usual in the Southern\r\nStates of the American Union before the Civil War; he was neither a\r\nhired man nor a rent-paying tenant-farmer, such as is common enough in\r\nall agricultural communities nowadays. The serf was not a slave,\r\nbecause he was free to work for himself at least part of the time; he\r\ncould not be sold to another master; and he could not be deprived of\r\nthe right to cultivate land for his own benefit. He was not a hired\r\nman, for he received no wages. And he was not a tenant-farmer, inasmuch\r\nas he was \"attached to the soil,\" that is, he was bound to stay and\r\nwork on his land, unless he succeeded in running away or in purchasing\r\ncomplete freedom, in which case he would cease to be a serf and would\r\nbecome a freeman.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Obligations of the Serf to the Lord]\r\n\r\nTo the lord of the manor the serf was under many and varied\r\nobligations, the most essential of which may be grouped conveniently as\r\nfollows: (1) The serf had to work without pay two or three days in each\r\nweek on the strips of land and the fields whose produce belonged\r\nexclusively to the nobleman. In the harvest season extra days, known as\r\n\"boon-days,\" were stipulated on which the serf must leave his own work\r\nin order to harvest for the lord. He also might be called upon in\r\nemergencies to draw a cord of wood from the forest to the great manor-\r\nhouse, or to work upon the highway (_corvée_). (2) The serf had to\r\npay occasional dues, customarily \"in kind.\" Thus at certain feast-days\r\nhe was expected to bring a dozen fat fowls or a bushel of grain to the\r\npantry of the manor-house. (3) Ovens, wine-presses, gristmills, and\r\nbridges were usually owned solely by the nobleman, and each time the\r\npeasant used them he was obliged to give one of his loaves of bread, a\r\nshare of his wine, a bushel of his grain, or a toll-fee, as a kind of\r\nrent, or \"banality\" as it was euphoniously styled. (4) If the serf died\r\nwithout heirs, his holdings were transferred outright to the lord, and\r\nif he left heirs, the nobleman had the rights of \"heriot,\" that is, to\r\nappropriate the best animal owned by the deceased peasant, and of\r\n\"relief,\" that is, to oblige the designated heir to make a definite\r\nadditional payment that was equivalent to a kind of inheritance tax.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Free-Tenants]\r\n\r\nAs has been intimated, the manorial system was already on a steady\r\ndecline, especially in western Europe, at the opening of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. A goodly number of peasants who had once been serfs were now\r\nfree-tenants, lessees, or hired laborers. Of course rent of farm-land\r\nin our present sense--each owner of the land letting out his property\r\nto a tenant and, in return, exacting as large a monetary payment as\r\npossible--was then unknown. But there was a growing class of peasants\r\nwho were spoken of as free-tenants to distinguish them from serf-\r\ntenants. These free-tenants, while paying regular dues, as did the\r\nothers, were not compelled to work two or three days every week in the\r\nlord's fields, except occasionally in busy seasons such as harvest;\r\nthey were free to leave the estate and to marry off their daughters or\r\nto sell their oxen without the consent of the lord; and they came to\r\nregard their customary payments to the lord not so much as his due for\r\ntheir protection as actual rent for their land.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hired Laborers]\r\n\r\nWhile more prosperous peasants were becoming free-tenants, many of\r\ntheir poorer neighbors found it so difficult to gain a living as serfs\r\nthat they were willing to surrender all claim to their own little\r\nstrips of land on the manor and to devote their whole time to working\r\nfor fixed wages on the fields which were cultivated for the nobleman\r\nhimself, the so-called lord's demesne. Thus a body of hired laborers\r\ngrew up claiming no land beyond that on which their miserable huts\r\nstood and possibly their small garden-plots.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Métayers]\r\n\r\nBesides hired laborers and free-tenants, a third group of peasants\r\nappeared in places where the noble proprietor did not care to\r\nsuperintend the cultivation of his own land. In this case he parceled\r\nit out among particular peasants, furnishing each with livestock and a\r\nplow and expecting in return a fixed proportion of the crops, which in\r\nFrance usually amounted to one-half. Peasants who made such a bargain\r\nwere called in France _métayers_, and in England \"stock-and-land\r\nlessees.\" The arrangement was not different essentially from the\r\nfamiliar present-day practice of working a farm \"on shares.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Steady Decline of Serfdom]\r\n\r\nIn France and in England the serfs had mostly become hired laborers,\r\ntenants, or _métayers_ by the sixteenth century. The obligations\r\nof serfdom had proved too galling for the serf and too unprofitable for\r\nthe lord. It was much easier and cheaper for the latter to hire men to\r\nwork just when he needed them, than to bother with serfs, who could not\r\nbe discharged readily for slackness, and who naturally worked for\r\nthemselves far more zealously than for him. For this reason many\r\nlandlords were glad to allow their serfs to make payments in money or\r\nin grain in lieu of the performance of customary labor. In England,\r\nmoreover, many lords, finding it profitable to inclose [Footnote: There\r\nwere no fences on the old manors. Inclosing a plot of ground meant\r\nfencing or hedging it in.] their land in order to utilize it as\r\npasturage for sheep, voluntarily freed their serfs. The result was that\r\nserfdom virtually had disappeared in England before the sixteenth\r\ncentury. In France as early as the fourteenth century the bulk of the\r\nserfs had purchased their liberty, although in a few districts serfdom\r\nremained in its pristine vigor until the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nIn other countries agricultural conditions were more backward and\r\nserfdom longer survived. Prussian and Austrian landowners retained\r\ntheir serfs until the nineteenth century; the emancipation of Russian\r\nserfs on a large scale was not inaugurated until 1861. There are still\r\nsurvivals of serfdom in parts of eastern Europe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Survival of Servile Obligations after Decline of Serfdom]\r\n\r\nEmancipation from serfdom by no means released the peasants from all\r\nthe disabilities under which they labored as serfs. True, the freeman\r\nno longer had week-work to do, provided he could pay for his time, and\r\nin theory at least he could marry as he chose and move freely from\r\nplace to place. But he might still be called upon for an occasional\r\nday's labor, he still was expected to work on the roads, and he still\r\nhad to pay annoying fees for oven, mill, and wine-press. Then, too, his\r\nown crops might be eaten with impunity by doves from the noble dovecote\r\nor trampled underfoot by a merry hunting-party from the manor-house.\r\nThe peasant himself ventured not to hunt: he was precluded even from\r\nshooting the deer that devoured his garden. Certain other customs\r\nprevailed in various localities, conceived originally no doubt in a\r\nspirit of good-natured familiarity between noble and peasants, but now\r\ngrown irritating if none the less humorous. It is said, for instance,\r\nthat in some places newly married couples were compelled to vault the\r\nwall of the churchyard, and that on certain nights the peasants were\r\nobliged to beat the castle ditch in order to rest the lord's family\r\nfrom the dismal croaking of the frogs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Persistence of \"Three-field System\" of Agriculture]\r\n\r\nIn another important respect the manorial system survived long after\r\nserfdom had begun to decline. This was the method of doing farm work. A\r\nuniversal and insistent tradition had fixed agricultural method on the\r\nmedieval manor and tended to preserve it unaltered well into modern\r\ntimes. The tradition was that of the \"three-field system\" of\r\nagriculture. The land of the manor, which might vary in amount from a\r\nfew hundred to five thousand acres, was not divided up into farms of\r\nirregular shape and size, as it would be now. The waste-land, which\r\ncould be used only for pasture, and the woodland on the outskirts of\r\nthe clearing, were treated as \"commons,\" that is to say, each villager,\r\nas well as the lord of the manor, might freely gather fire-wood, or he\r\nmight turn his swine loose to feed on the acorns in the forest and his\r\ncattle to graze over the entire pasture. The cultivable or arable land\r\nwas divided into several--usually three--great grain fields. Ridges or\r\n\"balks\" of unplowed turf divided each field into long parallel strips,\r\nwhich were usually forty rods or a furlong (furrow-long) in length, and\r\nfrom one to four rods wide. Each peasant had exclusive right to one or\r\nmore of these strips in each of the three great fields, making, say,\r\nthirty acres in all; [Footnote: In some localities it was usual to\r\nredistribute these strips every year. In that way the greater part of\r\nthe manor was theoretically \"common\" land, and no peasant had a right\r\nof private ownership to any one strip.] the lord too had individual\r\nright to a number of strips in the great fields.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disadvantages of Three-field System of Agriculture]\r\n\r\nThis so-called three-field system of agriculture was distinctly\r\ndisadvantageous in many ways. Much time was wasted in going back and\r\nforth between the scattered plots of land. The individual peasant,\r\nmoreover, was bound by custom to cultivate his land precisely as his\r\nancestors had done, without attempting to introduce improvements. He\r\ngrew the same crops as his neighbors--usually wheat or rye in one\r\nfield; beans or barley in the second; and nothing in the third. Little\r\nwas known about preserving the fertility of the soil by artificial\r\nmanuring or by rotation of crops; and, although every year one-third of\r\nthe land was left \"fallow\" (uncultivated) in order to restore its\r\nfertility, the yield per acre was hardly a fourth as large as now. Farm\r\nimplements were of the crudest kind; scythes and sickles did the work\r\nof mowing machines; plows were made of wood, occasionally shod with\r\niron; and threshing was done with flails. After the grain had been\r\nharvested, cattle were turned out indiscriminately on the stubble, on\r\nthe supposition that the fields were common property. It was useless to\r\nattempt to breed fine cattle when all were herded together. The breed\r\ndeteriorated, and both cattle and sheep were undersized and poor. A\r\nfull-grown ox was hardly larger than a good-sized calf of the present\r\ntime. Moreover, there were no potatoes or turnips, and few farmers grew\r\nclover or other grasses for winter fodder. It was impossible,\r\ntherefore, to keep many cattle through the winter; most of the animals\r\nwere killed off in the autumn and salted down for the long winter\r\nmonths when it was impossible to secure fresh meat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peasant Life on the Manor]\r\n\r\nCrude farm-methods and the heavy dues exacted by the lord [Footnote: In\r\naddition to the dues paid to the lay lord, the peasants were under\r\nobligation to make a regular contribution to the church, which was\r\ncalled the \"tithe\" and amounted to a share, less than a tenth, of the\r\nannual crops.] of the manor must have left the poor man little for\r\nhimself. Compared with the comfort of the farmer today, the poverty of\r\nsixteenth-century peasants must have been inexpressibly distressful.\r\nHow keenly the cold pierced the dark huts of the poorest, is hard for\r\nus to imagine. The winter diet of salt meat, the lack of vegetables,\r\nthe chronic filth and squalor, and the sorry ignorance of all laws of\r\nhealth opened the way to disease and contagion. And if the crops\r\nfailed, famine was added to plague.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand we must not forget that the tenement-houses of our\r\ngreat cities have been crowded in the nineteenth century with people\r\nmore miserable than ever was serf of the middle ages. The serf, at any\r\nrate, had the open air instead of a factory in which to work. When\r\ntimes were good, he had grain and meat in plenty, and possibly wine or\r\ncider, and he hardly envied the tapestried chambers, the bejeweled\r\nclothes, and the spiced foods of the nobility, for he looked upon them\r\nas belonging to a different world.\r\n\r\nIn one place nobleman and peasant met on a common footing--in the\r\nvillage church. There, on Sundays and feast-days, they came together as\r\nChristians to hear Mass; and afterwards, perhaps, holiday games and\r\ndancing on the green, benignantly patronized by the lord's family,\r\nhelped the common folk to forget their labors. The village priest,\r\n[Footnote: Usually very different from the higher clergy, who had large\r\nlanded estates of their own, the parish priests had but modest incomes\r\nfrom the tithes of their parishioners and frequently eked out a living\r\nby toiling on allotted patches of ground. The monks too were ordinarily\r\npoor, although the monastery might be wealthy, and they likewise often\r\ntilled the fields.] himself often of humble birth, though the most\r\nlearned man on the manor, was at once the friend and benefactor of the\r\npoor and the spiritual director of the lord. Occasionally a visit of\r\nthe bishop to administer confirmation to the children, afforded an\r\nopportunity for gayety and universal festivity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rural Isolation and Conservatism]\r\n\r\nAt other times there was little to disturb the monotony of village life\r\nand little to remind it of the outside world, except when a gossiping\r\npeddler chanced along, or when the squire rode away to court or to war.\r\nIntercourse with other villages was unnecessary, unless there were no\r\nblacksmith or miller on the spot. The roads were poor and in wet\r\nweather impassable. Travel was largely on horseback, and what few\r\ncommodities were carried from place to place were transported by pack-\r\nhorses. Only a few old soldiers, and possibly a priest, had traveled\r\nvery much; they were the only geographies and the only books of travel\r\nwhich the village possessed, for few peasants could read or write.\r\n\r\nSelf-sufficient and secluded from the outer world, the rural village\r\nwent on treasuring its traditions, keeping its old customs, century\r\nafter century. The country instinctively distrusted all novelties; it\r\nalways preferred old ways to new; it was heartily conservative.\r\nCountry-folk did not discover America. It was the enterprise of the\r\ncities, with their growing industries and commerce, which brought about\r\nthe Commercial Revolution; and to the development of commerce,\r\nindustry, and the towns, we now must turn our attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOWNS ON THE EVE OF THE COMMERCIAL REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Trade and the Towns ]\r\n\r\nExcept for the wealthy Italian city-states and a few other cities which\r\ntraced their history back to Roman times, most European towns, it must\r\nbe remembered, dated only from the later middle ages. At first there\r\nwas little excuse for their existence except to sell to farmers salt,\r\nfish, iron, and a few plows. But with the increase of commerce, which,\r\nas we shall see, especially marked the thirteenth, fourteenth, and\r\nfifteenth centuries, more merchants traveled through the country, ways\r\nof spending money multiplied, and the little agricultural villages\r\nlearned to look on the town as the place to buy not only luxuries but\r\nsuch tools, clothing, and shoes as could be manufactured more\r\nconveniently by skillful town artisans than by clumsy rustics. The\r\ntowns, moreover, became exchanges where surplus farm products could be\r\nmarketed, where wine could be bartered for wool, or wheat for flax. And\r\nas the towns grew in size, the prosperous citizens proved to be the\r\nbest customers for foreign luxuries, and foreign trade grew apace.\r\nTown, trade, and industry thus worked together: trade stimulated\r\nindustry, industry assisted trade, and the town profited by both. By\r\nthe sixteenth century the towns had grown out of their infancy and were\r\nmaintaining a great measure of political and economic freedom.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Freedom of the Towns.]\r\n[Sidenote: Town Charters]\r\n\r\nOriginally many a town had belonged to some nobleman's extensive manor\r\nand its inhabitants had been under much the same servile obligations to\r\nthe lord as were the strictly rural serfs. But with the lapse of time\r\nand the growth of the towns, the townsmen or burghers had begun a\r\nstruggle for freedom from their feudal lords. They did not want to pay\r\nservile dues to a baron, but preferred to substitute a fixed annual\r\npayment for individual obligations; they besought the right to manage\r\ntheir market; they wished to have cases at law tried in a court of\r\ntheir own rather than in the feudal court over which the nobleman\r\npresided; and they demanded the right to pay all taxes in a lump sum\r\nfor the town, themselves assessing and collecting the share of each\r\ncitizen. These concessions they eventually had won, and each city had\r\nits charter, in which its privileges were enumerated and recognized by\r\nthe authority of the nobleman, or of the king, to whom the city owed\r\nallegiance. In England these charters had been acquired generally by\r\nmerchant gilds, upon payment of a substantial sum to the nobleman; in\r\nFrance frequently the townsmen had formed associations, called\r\n_communes_, and had rebelled successfully against their feudal\r\nlords; in Germany the cities had leagued together for mutual protection\r\nand for the acquisition of common privileges. Other towns, formerly\r\nfounded by bishops, abbots, or counts, had received charters at the\r\nvery outset.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Merchant Gilds]\r\n\r\nA peculiar outgrowth of the need for protection against oppressive\r\nfeudal lords, as well as against thieves, swindlers, and dishonest\r\nworkmen, had been the typically urban organization known as the\r\nmerchant gild or the merchants' company. In the year 1500 the merchant\r\ngilds were everywhere on the decline, but they still preserved many of\r\ntheir earlier and more glorious traditions. At the time of their\r\ngreatest importance they had embraced merchants, butchers, bakers, and\r\ncandlestick-makers: in fact, all who bought or sold in the town were\r\nincluded in the gild. And the merchant gild had then possessed the\r\nwidest functions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Earlier Functions of the Merchant Gild.]\r\n[Sidenote: Social]\r\n\r\nIts social and religious functions, inherited from much earlier bodies,\r\nconsisted in paying some special honor to a patron saint, in giving aid\r\nto members in sickness or misfortune, attending funerals, and also in\r\nthe more enjoyable meetings when the freely flowing bowl enlivened the\r\ntransaction of gild business.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Protective]\r\n\r\nAs a protective organization, the gild had been particularly effective.\r\nBacked by the combined forces of all the gildsmen, it was able to\r\nassert itself against the lord who claimed manorial rights over the\r\ntown, and to insist that a runaway serf who had lived in the town for a\r\nyear and a day should not be dragged back to perform his servile labor\r\non the manor, but should be recognized as a freeman. The protection of\r\nthe gild was accorded also to townsmen on their travels. In those days\r\nall strangers were regarded as suspicious persons, and not infrequently\r\nwhen a merchant of the gild traveled to another town he would be set\r\nupon and robbed or cast into prison. In such cases it was necessary for\r\nthe gild to ransom the imprisoned \"brother\" and, if possible, to punish\r\nthe persons who had done the injury, so that thereafter the liberties\r\nof the gild members would be respected. That the business of the gild\r\nmight be increased, it was often desirable to enter into special\r\narrangements with neighboring cities whereby the rights, lives, and\r\nproperties of gildsmen were guaranteed; and the gild as a whole was\r\nresponsible for the debts of any of its members.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Regulative]\r\n\r\nThe most important duty of the gild had been the regulation of the home\r\nmarket. Burdensome restrictions were laid upon the stranger who\r\nattempted to utilize the advantages of the market without sharing the\r\nexpense of maintenance. No goods were allowed to be carried away from\r\nthe city if the townsmen wished to buy; and a tax, called in France the\r\n_octroi_, was levied on goods brought into the town. [Footnote:\r\nThe _octroi_ is still collected in Paris.] Moreover, a conviction\r\nprevailed that the gild was morally bound to enforce honest\r\nstraightforward methods of business; and the \"wardens\" appointed by the\r\ngild to supervise the market endeavored to prevent, as dishonest\r\npractices, \"forestalling\" (buying outside of the regular market),\r\n\"engrossing\" (cornering the market), [Footnote: The idea that\r\n\"combinations in restraint of trade\" are wrong quite possibly goes back\r\nto this abhorrence of engrossing.] and \"regrating\" (retailing at higher\r\nthan market price). The dishonest green grocer was not allowed to use a\r\npeck-measure with false bottom, for weighing and measuring were done by\r\nofficials. Cheats were fined heavily and, if they persisted in their\r\nevil ways, they might be expelled from the gild.\r\n\r\nThese merchant gilds, with their social, protective, and regulative\r\nfunctions, had first begun to be important in the eleventh century. In\r\nEngland, where their growth was most rapid, 82 out of the total of 102\r\ntowns had merchant gilds by the end of the thirteenth century.\r\n[Footnote: Several important places, such as London, Colchester, and\r\nNorwich, belonged to the small minority without merchant gilds.] On the\r\nContinent many towns, especially in Germany, had quite different\r\narrangements, and where merchant gilds existed, they were often\r\nexclusive and selfish groups of merchants in a single branch of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decline of Merchant Guilds]\r\n\r\nWith the expansion of trade and industry in the thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth centuries the rule of the old merchant gilds, instead of\r\nkeeping pace with the times, became oppressive, limited, or merely\r\nnominal. Where the merchant gilds became oppressive oligarchical\r\nassociations, as they did in Germany and elsewhere on the Continent,\r\nthey lost their power by the revolt of the more democratic \"craft\r\ngilds.\" In England specialized control of industry and trade by craft\r\ngilds, journeymen's gilds, and dealers' associations gradually took the\r\nplace of the general supervision of the older merchant gild. After\r\nsuffering the loss of its vital functions, the merchant gild by the\r\nsixteenth century either quietly succumbed or lived on with power in a\r\nlimited branch of trade, or continued as an honorary organization with\r\noccasional feasts, or, and this was especially true in England, it\r\nbecame practically identical with the town corporation, from which\r\noriginally it had been distinct.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Industry: the Craft Guilds]\r\n\r\nAlongside of the merchant gilds, which had been associated with the\r\ngrowth of commerce and the rise of towns, were other guilds connected\r\nwith the growth of industry, which retained their importance long after\r\n1500. These were the craft gilds. [Footnote: The craft gild was also\r\ncalled a company, or a mistery, or _métier_ (French), or _Zunft_\r\n(German).] Springing into prominence in the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies, the craft gild sometimes, as in Germany, voiced a popular\r\nrevolt against corrupt and oligarchical merchant gilds, and\r\nsometimes most frequently so in England--worked quite harmoniously with\r\nthe merchant gild, to which its own members belonged. In common with\r\nthe merchant gild, the craft gild had religious and social aspects, and\r\nlike the merchant gild it insisted on righteous dealings; but unlike\r\nthe merchant gild it was composed of men in a single industry, and it\r\ncontrolled in detail the manufacture as well as the marketing of\r\ncommodities. There were bakers' gilds, brewers' gilds, smiths' gilds,\r\nsaddlers' gilds, shoemakers' gilds, weavers' gilds, tailors' gilds,\r\ntanners' gilds, even gilds of masters of arts who constituted the\r\nteaching staff of colleges and universities.\r\n\r\nWhen to-day we speak of a boy \"serving his apprenticeship\" in a trade,\r\nwe seldom reflect that the expression is derived from a practice of the\r\nmedieval craft gilds, a practice which survived after the gilds were\r\nextinct. Apprenticeship was designed to make sure that recruits to the\r\ntrade were properly trained. The apprentice was usually selected as a\r\nboy by a master-workman and indentured--that is, bound to work several\r\nyears without wages, while living at the master's house. After the\r\nexpiration of this period of apprenticeship, during which he had\r\nlearned his trade thoroughly, the youth became a \"journeyman,\" and\r\nworked for wages, until he should finally receive admission to the gild\r\nas a master, with the right to set up his own little shop, with\r\napprentices and journeymen of his own, and to sell his wares directly\r\nto those who used them.\r\n\r\nThis restriction of membership was not the only way in which the trade\r\nwas supervised. The gild had rules specifying the quality of materials\r\nto be used and often, likewise, the methods of manufacture; it might\r\nprohibit night-work, and it usually fixed a \"fair price\" at which goods\r\nwere to be sold. By means of such provisions, enforced by wardens or\r\ninspectors, the gild not only perpetuated the \"good old way\" of doing\r\nthings, but guaranteed to the purchaser a thoroughly good article at a\r\nfair price.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Partial Decay of Craft Gilds]\r\n\r\nBy the opening of the sixteenth century the craft gilds, though not so\r\nweakened as the merchant gilds, were suffering from various internal\r\ndiseases which sapped their vitality. They tended to become exclusive\r\nand to direct their power and affluence in hereditary grooves. They\r\nsteadily raised their entrance fees and qualifications. Struggles\r\nbetween gilds in allied trades, such as spinning, weaving, fulling, and\r\ndyeing, often resulted in the reduction of several gilds to a dependent\r\nposition. The regulation of the processes of manufacture, once designed\r\nto keep up the standard of skill, came in time to be a powerful\r\nhindrance to technical improvements; and in the method as well as in\r\nthe amount of his work, the enterprising master found himself\r\nhandicapped. Even the old conscientiousness often gave way to greed,\r\nuntil in many places inferior workmanship received the approval of the\r\ngild.\r\n\r\nMany craft gilds exhibited in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries a\r\ntendency to split somewhat along the present lines of capital and\r\nlabor. On the one hand the old gild organization would be usurped and\r\ncontrolled by the wealthier master-workmen, called \"livery men,\"\r\nbecause they wore rich uniforms, or a class of dealers would arise and\r\norganize a \"merchants' company\" to conduct a wholesale business in the\r\nproducts of a particular industry. Thus the rich drapers sold all the\r\ncloth, but did not help to make it. On the other hand it became\r\nincreasingly difficult for journeymen and apprentices to rise to the\r\nstation of masters; oftentimes they remained wage-earners for life. In\r\norder to better their condition they formed new associations, which in\r\nEngland were called journeymen's or yeomen's companies. These new\r\norganizations were symptomatic of injustice but otherwise unimportant.\r\nThe craft gilds, with all their imperfections, were to continue in\r\npower awhile longer, slowly giving away as new trades arose outside of\r\ntheir control, gradually succumbing in competition with capitalists who\r\nrefused to be bound by gild rules and who were to evolve a new\r\n\"domestic system,\" [Footnote: See Vol. II, ch xviii.] and slowly\r\nsuffering diminution of prestige through royal interference.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Life in the Towns]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1500 the European towns displayed little uniformity in\r\ngovernment or in the amount of liberty they possessed. Some were petty\r\nrepublics subject only in a very vague way to an extraneous potentate;\r\nsome merely paid annual tribute to a lord; some were administered by\r\nofficers of a king or feudal magnate; others were controlled by\r\noligarchical commercial associations. But of the general appearance and\r\nlife of sixteenth-century towns, it is possible to secure a more\r\nuniform notion.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that the towns were comparatively small, for\r\nthe great bulk of people still lived in the country. A town of 5000\r\ninhabitants was then accounted large; and even the largest places, like\r\nNuremberg, Strassburg, London, Paris, and Bruges, would have been only\r\nsmall cities in our eyes. The approach to an ordinary city of the time\r\nlay through suburbs, farms, and garden-plots, for the townsman still\r\nsupplemented industry with small-scale agriculture. Usually the town\r\nitself was inclosed by strong walls, and admission was to be gained\r\nonly by passing through the gates, where one might be accosted by\r\nsoldiers and forced to pay toll. Inside the walls were clustered houses\r\nof every description. Rising from the midst of tumble-down dwellings\r\nmight stand a magnificent cathedral, town-hall, or gild building. Here\r\nand there a prosperous merchant would have his luxurious home, built in\r\nwhat we now call the Gothic style, with pointed windows and gables,\r\nand, to save space in a walled town, with the second story projecting\r\nout over the street.\r\n\r\nThe streets were usually in deplorable condition. There might be one or\r\ntwo broad highways, but the rest were mere alleys, devious, dark, and\r\ndirty. Often their narrowness made them impassable for wagons. In\r\nplaces the pedestrian waded gallantly through mud and garbage; pigs\r\ngrunted ponderously as he pushed them aside; chickens ran under his\r\nfeet; and occasionally a dead dog obstructed the way. There were no\r\nsidewalks, and only the main thoroughfares were paved. Dirt and filth\r\nand refuse were ordinarily disposed of only when a heaven-sent rain\r\nwashed them down the open gutters constructed along the middle, or on\r\neach side, of a street. Not only was there no general sewerage for the\r\ntown, but there was likewise no public water supply. In many of the\r\ngarden plots at the rear of the low-roofed dwellings were dug wells\r\nwhich provided water for the family; and the visitor, before he left\r\nthe town, would be likely to meet with water-sellers calling out their\r\nware. To guard against the danger of fires, each municipality\r\nencouraged its citizens to build their houses of stone and to keep a\r\ntub full of water before every building; and in each district a special\r\nofficial was equipped with a proper hook and cord for pulling down\r\nhouses on fire. At night respectable town-life was practically at a\r\nstandstill: the gates were shut; the curfew sounded; no street-lamps\r\ndispelled the darkness, except possibly an occasional lantern which an\r\naltruistic or festive townsman might hang in his front-window; and no\r\nefficient police-force existed--merely a handful of townsmen were\r\ndrafted from time to time as \"watchmen\" to preserve order, and the\r\n\"night watch\" was famed rather for its ability to sleep or to roister\r\nthan to protect life or purse. Under these circumstances the citizen\r\nwho would escape an assault by ruffians or thieves remained prudently\r\nindoors at night and retired early to bed. Picturesque and quaint the\r\nsixteenth-century town may have been; but it was also an uncomfortable\r\nand an unhealthful place in which to live.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRADE PRIOR TO THE COMMERCIAL REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nJust as agriculture is the ultimate basis of human society, so town-\r\nlife has always been an index of culture and civilization. And the\r\nfortunes of town-life have ever depended upon the vicissitudes of trade\r\nand commerce. So the reviving commerce of the later middle ages between\r\nEurope and the East meant the growth of cities and betokened an advance\r\nin civilization.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revival of Trade with the East]\r\n\r\nTrade between Europe and Asia, which had been a feature of the antique\r\nworld of Greeks and Romans, had been very nearly destroyed by the\r\nbarbarian invasions of the fifth century and by subsequent conflicts\r\nbetween Mohammedans and Christians, so that during several centuries\r\nthe old trade-routes were traveled only by a few Jews and with the\r\nSyrians. In the tenth century, however, a group of towns in southern\r\nItaly--Brindisi, Bari, Taranto, and Amalfi--began to send ships to the\r\neastern Mediterranean and were soon imitated by Venice and later by\r\nGenoa and Pisa.\r\n\r\nThis revival of intercourse between the East and the West was well\r\nunder way before the first Crusade, but the Crusades (1095-1270)\r\nhastened the process. Venice, Genoa, and Pisa, on account of their\r\nconvenient location, were called upon to furnish the crusaders with\r\ntransportation and provisions, and their shrewd Italian citizens made\r\ncertain that such services were well rewarded. Italian ships, plying to\r\nand from the Holy Land, gradually enriched their owners. Many Italian\r\ncities profited, but Venice secured the major share. It was during the\r\nCrusades that Venice gained numerous coastal districts and islands in\r\nthe Ægean besides immunities and privileges in Constantinople, and\r\nthereby laid the foundation of her maritime empire.\r\n\r\nThe Crusades not only enabled Italian merchants to bring Eastern\r\ncommodities to the West; they increased the demand for such\r\ncommodities. Crusaders--pilgrims and adventurers--returned from the\r\nHoly Land with astonishing tales of the luxury and opulence of the\r\nEast. Not infrequently they had acquired a taste for Eastern silks or\r\nspices during their stay in Asia Minor or Palestine; or they brought\r\ncurious jewels stripped from fallen infidels to awaken the envy of the\r\nstay-at-homes. Wealth was rapidly increasing in Europe at this time,\r\nand the many well-to-do people who were eager to affect magnificence\r\nprovided a ready market for the wares imported by Italian merchants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commodities of Eastern Trade]\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to note just what were these wares and why they were\r\ndemanded so insistently. First were spices, far more important then\r\nthan now. The diet of those times was simple and monotonous without our\r\nvariety of vegetables and sauces and sweets, and the meat, if fresh,\r\nwas likely to be tough in fiber and strong in flavor. Spices were the\r\nvery thing to add zest to such a diet, and without them the epicure of\r\nthe sixteenth century would have been truly miserable. Ale and wine, as\r\nwell as meats, were spiced, and pepper was eaten separately as a\r\ndelicacy. No wonder that, although the rich alone could buy it, the\r\nVenetians were able annually to dispose of 420,000 pounds of pepper,\r\nwhich they purchased from the sultan of Egypt, to whom it was brought,\r\nafter a hazardous journey, from the pepper vines of Ceylon, Sumatra, or\r\nwestern India. From the same regions came cinnamon-bark; ginger was a\r\nproduct of Arabia, India, and China; and nutmegs, cloves, and allspice\r\ngrew only in the far-off Spice Islands of the Malay Archipelago.\r\n\r\nPrecious stones were then, as always, in demand for personal adornment\r\nas well as for the decoration of shrines and ecclesiastical vestments;\r\nand in the middle ages they were thought by many to possess magical\r\nqualities which rendered them doubly valuable. [Footnote: Medieval\r\nliterature is full of this idea. Thus we read in the book of travel\r\nwhich has borne the name of Sir John Maundeville:\r\n\"And if you wish to know the virtues of the diamond, I shall tell you,\r\nas they that are beyond the seas say and affirm, from whom all science\r\nand philosophy comes. He who carries the diamond upon him, it gives him\r\nhardiness and manhood, and it keeps the limbs of his body whole. It\r\ngives him victory over his enemies, in court and in war, if his cause\r\nbe just; and it keeps him that bears it in good wit; and it keeps him\r\nfrom strife and riot, from sorrows and enchantments, and from fantasies\r\nand illusions of wicked spirits. ... [It] heals him that is lunatic,\r\nand those whom the fiend torments or pursues.\"] The supply of diamonds,\r\nrubies, pearls, and other precious stones was then almost exclusively\r\nfrom Persia, India, and Ceylon.\r\n\r\nOther miscellaneous products of the East were in great demand for\r\nvarious purposes: camphor and cubebs from Sumatra and Borneo; musk from\r\nChina; cane-sugar from Arabia and Persia; indigo, sandal-wood, and\r\naloes-wood from India; and alum from Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nThe East was not only a treasure-house of spices, jewels, valuable\r\ngoods, and medicaments, but a factory of marvelously delicate goods and\r\nwares which the West could not rival--glass, porcelain, silks, satins,\r\nrugs, tapestries, and metal-work. The tradition of Asiatic supremacy in\r\nthese manufactures has been preserved to our own day in such familiar\r\nnames as damask linen, china-ware, japanned ware, Persian rugs, and\r\ncashmere shawls.\r\n\r\nIn exchange for the manifold products of the East, Europe had only\r\nrough woolen cloth, arsenic, antimony, quicksilver, tin, copper, lead,\r\nand coral to give; and a balance, therefore, always existed for the\r\nEuropean merchant to pay in gold and silver, with the result that gold\r\nand silver coins grew scarce in the West. It is hard to say what would\r\nhave happened had not a new supply of the precious metals been\r\ndiscovered in America. But we are anticipating our story.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oriental Trade-Routes]\r\n\r\nNature has rendered intercourse between Europe and Asia exceedingly\r\ndifficult by reason of a vast stretch of almost impassable waste,\r\nextending from the bleak plains on either side of the Ural hills down\r\nacross the steppes of Turkestan and the desert of Arabia to the great\r\nsandy Sahara. Through the few gaps in this desert barrier have led from\r\nearly times the avenues of trade. In the fifteenth century three main\r\ntrade-routes--a central, a southern, and a northern--precariously\r\nlinked the two continents.\r\n\r\n(1) The central trade-route utilized the valley of the Tigris River.\r\nGoods from China, from the Spice Islands, and from India were brought\r\nby odd native craft from point to point along the coast to Ormuz, an\r\nimportant city at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, thence to the mouth of\r\nthe Tigris, and up the valley to Bagdad. From Bagdad caravans journeyed\r\neither to Aleppo and Antioch on the northeastern corner of the\r\nMediterranean, or across the desert to Damascus and the ports on the\r\nSyrian coast. Occasionally caravans detoured southward to Cairo and\r\nAlexandria in Egypt. Whether at Antioch, Jaffa, or Alexandria, the\r\ncaravans met the masters of Venetian ships ready to carry the cargo to\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n(2) The southern route was by the Red Sea. Arabs sailed their ships\r\nfrom India and the Far East across the Indian Ocean and into the Red\r\nSea, whence they transferred their cargoes to caravans which completed\r\nthe trip to Cairo and Alexandria. By taking advantage of monsoons,--the\r\nfavorable winds which blew steadily in certain seasons,--the skipper of\r\na merchant vessel could make the voyage from India to Egypt in somewhat\r\nless than three months. It was often possible to shorten the time by\r\nlanding the cargoes at Ormuz and thence dispatching them by caravan\r\nacross the desert of Arabia to Mecca, and so to the Red Sea, but\r\ncaravan travel was sometimes slower and always more hazardous than\r\nsailing.\r\n\r\n(3) The so-called \"northern route\" was rather a system of routes\r\nleading in general from the \"back doors\" of India and China to the\r\nBlack Sea. Caravans from India and China met at Samarkand and Bokhara,\r\ntwo famous cities on the western slope of the Tian-Shan Mountains. West\r\nof Bokhara the route branched out. Some caravans went north of the\r\nCaspian, through Russia to Novgorod and the Baltic. Other caravans\r\npassed through Astrakhan, at the mouth of the Volga River, and\r\nterminated in ports on the Sea of Azov. Still others skirted the shore\r\nof the Caspian Sea, passing through Tabriz and Armenia to Trebizond on\r\nthe Black Sea.\r\n\r\nThe transportation of goods from the Black Sea and eastern\r\nMediterranean was largely in the hands of the Italian cities,[Footnote:\r\nIn general, the journey from the Far East to the ports on the Black Sea\r\nand the eastern Mediterranean was performed by Arabs, although some of\r\nthe more enterprising Italians pushed on from the European settlements,\r\nor _fondachi_, in ports like Cairo and Trebizond, and established\r\n_fondachi_ in the inland cities of Asia Minor, Persia, and Russia.]\r\nespecially Venice, Genoa, Pisa, and Florence, although Marseilles\r\nand Barcelona had a small share. From Italy trade-routes led\r\nthrough the passes of the Alps to all parts of Europe. German merchants\r\nfrom Nuremberg, Augsburg, Ulm, Regensburg, and Constance purchased\r\nEastern commodities in the markets of Venice, and sent them back to the\r\nGermanies, to England, and to the Scandinavian countries. After the\r\nlapse of many months, and even years, since the time when spices had\r\nbeen packed first in the distant Moluccas, they would be exposed\r\nfinally for sale at the European fairs or markets to which thousands of\r\ncountryfolk resorted. There a nobleman's steward could lay in a year's\r\nsupply of condiments, or a peddler could fill his pack with silks and\r\nornaments to delight the eyes of the ladies in many a lonesome castle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difficulties of European Commerce]\r\n\r\nWithin Europe commerce gradually extended its scope in spite of the\r\nalmost insuperable difficulties. The roads were still so miserable that\r\nwares had to be carried on pack-horses instead of in wagons. Frequently\r\nthe merchant had to risk spoiling his bales of silk in fording a\r\nstream, for bridges were few and usually in urgent need of repair.\r\nTravel not only was fraught with hardship; it was expensive. Feudal\r\nlords exacted heavy tolls from travelers on road, bridge, or river.\r\nBetween Mainz and Cologne, on the Rhine, toll was levied in thirteen\r\ndifferent places. The construction of shorter and better highways was\r\nblocked often by nobles who feared to lose their toll-rights on the old\r\nroads. So heavy was the burden of tolls on commerce that transportation\r\nfrom Nantes to Orleans, a short distance up the River Loire, doubled\r\nthe price of goods. Besides the tolls, one had to pay for local market\r\nprivileges; towns exacted taxes on imports; and the merchant in a\r\nstrange city or village often found himself seriously handicapped by\r\nregulations against \"foreigners,\" and by unfamiliar weights, measures,\r\nand coinage.\r\n\r\nMost dreaded of all, however, and most injurious to trade were the\r\nrobbers who infested the roads. Needy knights did not scruple to turn\r\nhighwaymen. Cautious travelers carried arms and journeyed in bands, but\r\neven they were not wholly safe from the dashing \"gentlemen of the\r\nroad.\" On the seas there was still greater danger from pirates. Fleets\r\nof merchantmen, despite the fact that they were accompanied usually by\r\na vessel of war, often were assailed by corsairs, defeated, robbed, and\r\nsold as prizes to the Mohammedans. The black flag of piracy flew over\r\nwhole fleets in the Baltic and in the Mediterranean. The amateur\r\npirate, if less formidable, was no less common, for many a vessel\r\ncarrying brass cannon, ostensibly for protection, found it convenient\r\nto use them to attack foreign craft and more frequently \"took\" a cargo\r\nthan purchased one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Venice]\r\n\r\nThese dangers and difficulties of commercial intercourse were due\r\nchiefly to the lack of any strong power to punish pirates or\r\nhighwaymen, to maintain roads, or to check the exactions of toll-\r\ncollectors. Each city attempted to protect its own commerce. A great\r\ncity-state like Venice was well able to send out her galleys against\r\nMediterranean pirates, to wage war against the rival city of Genoa, to\r\nmake treaties with Oriental potentates, and to build up a maritime\r\nempire. Smaller towns were helpless. But what, as in the case of the\r\nGerman towns, they could not do alone, was partially achieved by\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Hanseatic League. Towns in the Netherlands: Bruges]\r\n\r\nThe Hanse or the Hanseatic League, as the confederation of Cologne,\r\nBrunswick, Hamburg, Lübeck, Dantzig, Königsberg, and other German\r\ncities was called, waged war against the Baltic pirates, maintained its\r\ntrade-routes, and negotiated with monarchs and municipalities in order\r\nto obtain exceptional privileges. From their Baltic stations,--\r\nNovgorod, Stockholm, Königsberg, etc.,--the Hanseatic merchants brought\r\namber, wax, fish, furs, timber, and tar to sell in the markets of\r\nBruges, London, and Venice; they returned with wheat, wine, salt,\r\nmetals, cloth, and beer for their Scandinavian and Russian customers.\r\nThe German trading post at Venice received metals, furs, leather goods,\r\nand woolen cloth from the North, and sent back spices, silks, and other\r\ncommodities of the East, together with glassware, fine textiles,\r\nweapons, and paper of Venetian manufacture. Baltic and Venetian trade-\r\nroutes crossed in the Netherlands, and during the fourteenth century\r\nBruges became the trade-metropolis of western Europe, where met the raw\r\nwool from England and Spain, the manufactured woolen cloth of Flanders,\r\nclarets from France, sherry and port wines from the Iberian peninsula,\r\npitch from Sweden, tallow from Norway, grain from France and Germany,\r\nand English tin, not to mention Eastern luxuries, Venetian\r\nmanufactures, and the cunning carved-work of south-German artificers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF EXPLORATION\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Desire of Spaniards and Portuguese for New Trade-Routes]\r\n\r\nIn the unprecedented commercial prosperity which marked the fifteenth\r\ncentury, two European peoples--the Portuguese and the Spanish--had\r\nlittle part. For purposes of general Continental trade they were not so\r\nconveniently situated as the peoples of Germany and the Netherlands;\r\nand the Venetians and other Italians had shut them off from direct\r\ntrade with Asia. Yet Spanish and Portuguese had developed much the same\r\ntaste for Oriental spices and wares as had the inhabitants of central\r\nEurope, and they begrudged the exorbitant prices which they were\r\ncompelled to pay to Italian merchants. Moreover, their centuries-long\r\ncrusades against Mohammedans in the Iberian peninsula and in northern\r\nAfrica had bred in them a stern and zealous Christianity which urged\r\nthem on to undertake missionary enterprises in distant pagan lands.\r\nThis missionary spirit reënforced the desire they already entertained\r\nof finding new trade-routes to Asia untrammeled by rival and selfish\r\nItalians. In view of these circumstances it is not surprising that\r\nSpaniards and Portuguese sought eagerly in the fifteenth century to\r\nfind new trade-routes to \"the Indies.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geographical Knowledge]\r\n\r\nIn their search for new trade-routes to the lands of silk and spice,\r\nthese peoples of southwestern Europe were not as much in the dark as\r\nsometimes we are inclined to believe. Geographical knowledge, almost\r\nnon-existent in the earlier middle ages, had been enriched by the\r\nFranciscan friars who had traversed central Asia to the court of the\r\nMongol emperor as early as 1245, and by such merchants and travelers as\r\nMarco Polo, who had been attached to the court of Kublai Khan and who\r\nsubsequently had described that potentate's realms and the wealth of\r\n\"Cipangu\" (Japan). These travels afforded at once information about\r\nAsia and enormous incentive to later explorers.\r\n\r\nPopular notions that the waters of the tropics boiled, that demons and\r\nmonsters awaited explorers to the westward, and that the earth was a\r\ngreat flat disk, did not pass current among well-informed geographers.\r\nEspecially since the revival of Ptolemy's works in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, learned men asserted that the earth was spherical in shape,\r\nand they even calculated its circumference, erring only by two or three\r\nthousand miles. It was maintained repeatedly that the Indies formed the\r\nwestern boundary of the Atlantic Ocean, and that consequently they\r\nmight be reached by sailing due west, as well as by traveling eastward;\r\nbut at the same time it was believed that shorter routes might be found\r\nnortheast of Europe, or southward around Africa.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Navigation]\r\n\r\nAlong with this general knowledge of the situation of continents, the\r\nsailors of the fifteenth century had learned a good deal about\r\nnavigation. The compass had been used first by Italian navigators in\r\nthe thirteenth century, mounted on the compass card in the fourteenth.\r\nLatitude was determined with the aid of the astrolabe, a device for\r\nmeasuring the elevation of the pole star above the horizon. With maps\r\nand accurate sailing directions (_portolani_), seamen could lose\r\nsight of land and still feel confident of their whereabouts. Yet it\r\nundoubtedly took courage for the explorers of the fifteenth century to\r\nsteer their frail sailing vessels either down the unexplored African\r\ncoast or across the uncharted Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Portuguese Explorers]\r\n\r\nIn the series of world-discoveries which brought about the Commercial\r\nRevolution and which are often taken as the beginning of \"modern\r\nhistory,\" there is no name more illustrious than that of a Portuguese\r\nprince of the blood,--Prince Henry, the Navigator (1394-1460), who,\r\nwith the support of two successive Portuguese kings, made the first\r\nsystematic attempts to convert the theories of geographers into proved\r\nfact. A variety of motives were his: the stern zeal of the crusader\r\nagainst the infidel; the ardent proselyting spirit which already had\r\nsent Franciscan monks into the heart of Asia; the hope of\r\nreëstablishing intercourse with \"Prester John's\" fabled Christian\r\nempire of the East; the love of exploration; and a desire to gain for\r\nPortugal a share of the Eastern trade.\r\n\r\nTo his naval training-station at Sagres and the neighboring port of\r\nLagos, Prince Henry attracted the most skillful Italian navigators and\r\nthe most learned geographers of the day. The expeditions which he sent\r\nout year after year rediscovered and colonized the Madeira and Azores\r\nIslands, and crept further and further down the unknown coast of the\r\nDark Continent. When in the year 1445, a quarter of a century after the\r\ninitial efforts of Prince Henry, Denis Diaz reached Cape Verde, he\r\nthought that the turning point was at hand; but four more weary decades\r\nwere to elapse before Bartholomew Diaz, in 1488, attained the\r\nsouthernmost point of the African coast. What he then called the Cape\r\nof Storms, King John II of Portugal in a more optimistic vein\r\nrechristened the Cape of Good Hope. Following in the wake of Diaz,\r\nVasco da Gama rounded the Cape in 1497, and then, continuing on his own\r\nway, he sailed up the east coast to Malindi, where he found a pilot\r\nable to guide his course eastward through the Indian Ocean to India. At\r\nCalicut Vasco da Gama landed in May, 1498, and there he erected a\r\nmarble pillar as a monument of his discovery of a new route to the\r\nIndies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Occupation of Old Trade-Routes by the Turks]\r\n\r\nWhile the Portuguese were discovering this new and all-water route to\r\nthe Indies, the more ancient Mediterranean and overland routes, which\r\nhad been of inestimable value to the Italians, were in process of\r\noccupation by the Routes by Ottoman Turks. [Footnote: Professor A. H.\r\nLybyer has recently and ably contended that, contrary to a view which\r\nhas often prevailed, the occupation of the medieval trade-routes by the\r\nOttoman Turks was not the cause of the Portuguese and Spanish\r\nexplorations which ushered in the Commercial Revolution. He has pointed\r\nout that prior to 1500 the prices of spices were not generally raised\r\nthroughout western Europe, and that apparently before that date the\r\nTurks had not seriously increased the difficulties of Oriental trade.\r\nIn confirmation of this opinion, it should be remembered that the\r\nPortuguese had begun their epochal explorations long before 1500 and\r\nthat Christopher Columbus had already returned from \"the Indies.\"]\r\nThese Turks, as we have seen, were a nomadic and warlike nation of the\r\nMohammedan faith who \"added to the Moslem contempt for the Christian,\r\nthe warrior's contempt for the mere merchant.\" Realizing that\r\nadvantageous trade relations with such a people were next to\r\nimpossible, the Italian merchants viewed with consternation the advance\r\nof the Turkish armies, as Asia Minor, Thrace, Macedonia, Greece, and\r\nthe islands of the Ægean were rapidly overrun. Constantinople, the\r\nheart of the Eastern Empire, repeatedly repelled the Moslems, but in\r\n1453 Emperor Constantine XI was defeated by Sultan Mohammed II, and the\r\ncrescent replaced the Greek cross above the Church of Saint Sophia.\r\nEight years later Trebizond, the terminal of the trade-route from\r\nTabriz, was taken. In vain Venice attempted to defend her possessions\r\nin the Black Sea and in the Ægean; by the year 1500 most of her empire\r\nin the Levant was lost. The Turks, now in complete control of the\r\nnorthern route, proceeded to impose crushing burdens on the trade of\r\nthe defeated Venetians. Florentines and other Italians who fared less\r\nhardly continued to frequent the Black Sea, but the entire trade\r\nsuffered from Turkish exactions and from disturbing wars between the\r\nTurks and another Asiatic people--the Mongols.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Loss to the Italians]\r\n\r\nFor some time the central and southern routes, terminating respectively\r\nin Syria and Egypt, exhibited increased activity, and by rich profits\r\nin Alexandria the Venetians were able to retrieve their losses in the\r\nBlack Sea. But it was only a matter of time before the Turks,\r\nconquering Damascus in 1516 and Cairo in 1517, extended their\r\nburdensome restrictions and taxes over those regions likewise. Eastern\r\nluxuries, transported by caravan and caravel over thousands of miles,\r\nhad been expensive and rare enough before; now the added peril of\r\ntravel and the exactions of the Turks bade fair to deprive the Italians\r\nof the greater part of their Oriental trade. It was at this very moment\r\nthat the Portuguese opened up independent routes to the East, lowered\r\nthe prices of Asiatic commodities, and grasped the scepter of maritime\r\nand commercial power which was gradually slipping from the hands of the\r\nVenetians. The misfortune of Venice was the real opportunity of\r\nPortugal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Columbus]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Spain had entered the field, and was meeting with cruel\r\ndisappointment. A decade before Vasco da Gama's famous voyage, an\r\nItalian navigator, Christopher Columbus, had presented himself at the\r\nSpanish court with a scheme for sailing westward to the Indies. The\r\nPortuguese king, by whom Columbus formerly had been employed, already\r\nhad refused to support the project, but after several vexatious rebuffs\r\nColumbus finally secured the aid of Ferdinand and Isabella, the Spanish\r\nmonarchs who were at the time jubilant over their capture of Granada\r\nfrom the Mohammedans (January, 1492). In August, 1492, he sailed from\r\nPalos with 100 men in three small ships, the largest of which weighed\r\nonly a hundred tons. After a tiresome voyage he landed (12 October,\r\n1492) on \"San Salvador,\" one of the Bahama Islands. In that bold voyage\r\nacross the trackless Atlantic lay the greatness of Columbus. He was not\r\nattempting to prove a theory that the earth was spherical--that was\r\naccepted generally by the well informed. Nor was he in search of a new\r\ncontinent. The realization that he had discovered not Asia, but a new\r\nworld, would have been his bitterest disappointment. He was seeking\r\nmerely another route to the spices and treasures of the East; and he\r\nbore with him a royal letter of introduction to the great Khan of\r\nCathay (China). In his quest he failed, even though he returned in\r\n1493, in 1498, and finally in 1502 and explored successively the\r\nCaribbean Sea, the coast of Venezuela, and Central America in a vain\r\nsearch for the island \"Cipangu\" and the realms of the \"Great Khan.\" He\r\nfound only \"lands of vanity and delusion as the miserable graves of\r\nCastilian gentlemen,\" and he died ignorant of the magnitude of his real\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: America]\r\n\r\nHad Columbus perished in mid ocean, it is doubtful whether America\r\nwould have remained long undiscovered. In 1497 John Cabot, an Italian\r\nin the service of Henry VII of England, reached the Canadian coast\r\nprobably near Cape Breton Island. In 1500 Cabral with a Portuguese\r\nexpedition bound for India was so far driven out of his course by\r\nequatorial currents that he came upon Brazil, which he claimed for the\r\nking of Portugal. Yet America was named for neither Columbus, Cabot,\r\nnor Cabral, but for another Italian, the Florentine Amerigo Vespucci,\r\nwho, returning from voyages to Brazil (1499-1500), published a letter\r\nconcerning what he called \"the new world.\" It was thought that he had\r\ndiscovered this new world, and so it was called after him,--America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First Circumnavigation of the Earth]\r\n\r\nVery slowly the truth about America was borne in upon the people of\r\nEurope. They persisted in calling the newly discovered lands the\r\n\"Indies,\" and even after Balboa had discovered (1513) that another\r\nocean lay beyond the Isthmus of Panama, it was thought that a few days'\r\nsail would bring one to the outlying possessions of the Great Khan. Not\r\nuntil Magellan, leaving Spain in 1519, passed through the straits that\r\nstill bear his name and crossed the Pacific was this vain hope\r\nrelinquished. Magellan was killed by the natives of the Philippine\r\nIslands, but one of his ships reached Seville in 1522 with the tale of\r\nthe marvelous voyage.\r\n\r\nEven after the circumnavigation of the world explorers looked for\r\nchannels leading through or around the Americas. Such were the attempts\r\nof Verrazano (1524), Cartier (1534), Frobisher (1576-1578), Davis\r\n(1585-1587), and Henry Hudson in 1609.\r\n\r\n\r\nESTABLISHMENT OF COLONIAL EMPIRES\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Portugal]\r\n\r\nWhen Vasco da Gama returned to Lisbon in 1499 with a cargo worth sixty\r\ntimes the cost of his expedition, the Portuguese knew that the wealth\r\nof the Indies was theirs. Cabral in 1500, and Albuquerque in 1503,\r\nfollowed the route of Da Gama, and thereafter Portuguese fleets rounded\r\nthe Cape year by year to gain control of Goa (India), Ormuz, Diu\r\n(India), Ceylon, Malacca, and the Spice Islands, and to bring back from\r\nthese places and from Sumatra, Java, Celebes, and Nanking (China) rich\r\ncargoes of \"spicery.\" After the Turkish conquest of Egypt in 1517 the\r\nbulk of commerce was carried on by way of the Cape of Good Hope, for it\r\nwas cheaper to transport goods by sea than to pay taxes to the Turks in\r\naddition to caravan cartage. Lisbon rapidly gained prominence as a\r\nmarket for Eastern wares.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese triumph was short-lived. Dominion over half the world--\r\nfor Portugal claimed all Africa, southern Asia, and Brazil as hers by\r\nright of discovery--had been acquired by the wise policy of the\r\nPortuguese royal house, but Portugal had neither products of her own to\r\nship to Asia, nor the might to defend her exclusive right to the\r\ncarrying trade with the Indies. The annexation of Portugal to Spain\r\n(1580) by Philip II precipitated disaster. The port of Lisbon was\r\nclosed to the French, English, and Dutch, with whom Philip was at war,\r\nand much of the colonial empire of Portugal was conquered speedily by\r\nthe Dutch.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spain]\r\n\r\nOn the first voyage of Columbus Spain based her claim to share the\r\nworld with Portugal. In order that there might be perfect harmony\r\nbetween the rival explorers of the unknown seas, Pope Alexander VI\r\nissued on 4 May, 1493, the famous bull [Footnote: A bull was a solemn\r\nletter or edict issued by the pope.] attempting to divide the\r\nuncivilized parts of the world between Spain and Portugal by the \"papal\r\nline of demarcation,\" drawn from pole to pole, 100 leagues west of the\r\nAzores. A year later the line was shifted to about 360 leagues west of\r\nthe Cape Verde Islands. Portugal had the eastern half of modern Brazil,\r\nAfrica, and all other heathen lands in that hemisphere; the rest\r\ncomprised the share of Spain.\r\n\r\nFor a time the Spanish adventurers were disappointed tremendously to\r\nfind neither spices nor silks and but little gold in the \"Indies,\" and\r\nColumbus was derisively dubbed the \"Admiral of the Mosquitos.\" In spite\r\nof failures the search for wealth was prosecuted with vigor. During the\r\nnext half century Haiti, called Hispaniola (\"Spanish Isle\"), served as\r\na starting point for the occupation of Puerto Rico, Cuba (1508), and\r\nother islands. An aged adventurer, Ponce de Leon, in search of a\r\nfountain of youth, explored the coast of Florida in 1513, and\r\nsubsequent expeditions pushed on to the Mississippi, across the plain\r\nof Texas, and even to California.\r\n\r\nMontezuma, ruler of the ancient Aztec [Footnote: The Aztec Indians of\r\nMexico, like various other tribes in Central America and in Peru, had\r\nreached in many respects a high degree of civilization before the\r\narrival of Europeans.] confederacy of Mexico, was overthrown in 1519 by\r\nthe reckless Hernando Cortez with a small band of soldiers. Here at\r\nlast the Spaniards found treasures of gold and silver, and more\r\nabundant yet were the stores of precious metal found by Pizarro in Peru\r\n(1531). Those were the days when a few score of brave men could capture\r\nkingdoms and carry away untold wealth.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter we shall see how the Spanish monarchy, backed by\r\nthe power of American riches, dazzled the eyes of Europe in the\r\nsixteenth century. Not content to see his standard waving over almost\r\nhalf of Europe, and all America (except Brazil), Philip II of Spain by\r\nconquering Portugal in 1580 added to his possessions the Portuguese\r\nempire in the Orient and in Brazil. The gold mines of America, the\r\nspices of Asia, and the busiest market of Europe--Antwerp--all paid\r\ntribute to his Catholic Majesty, Philip II of Spain.\r\n\r\nBy an unwise administration of this vast empire, Spain, in the course\r\nof time, killed the goose that laid the golden egg. The native Indians,\r\nenslaved and lashed to their work in Peruvian and Mexican silver mines,\r\nrapidly lost even their primitive civilization and died in alarming\r\nnumbers. This in itself would not have weakened the monarchy greatly,\r\nbut it appeared more serious when we remember that the high-handed and\r\nharassing regulations imposed by short-sighted or selfish officials had\r\nchecked the growth of a healthy agricultural and industrial population\r\nin the colonies, and that the bulk of the silver was going to support\r\nthe pride of grandees and to swell the fortunes of German speculators,\r\nrather than to fill the royal coffers. The taxes levied on trade with\r\nthe colonies were so exorbitant that the commerce with America fell\r\nlargely into the hands of English and Dutch smugglers. Under wise\r\ngovernment the monopoly of the African trade-route might have proved\r\nextremely valuable, but Philip II, absorbed in other matters, allowed\r\nthis, too, to slip from his fingers.\r\n\r\nWhile the Spanish monarchy was thus reaping little benefit from its\r\nworld-wide colonial possessions, it was neglecting to encourage\r\nprosperity at home. Trade and manufacture had expanded enormously in\r\nthe sixteenth century in the hands of the Jews and Moors. Woolen\r\nmanufactures supported nearly a third of the population. The silk\r\nmanufacture had become important. It is recorded that salt-works of the\r\nregion about Santa Maria often sent out fifty shiploads at a time.\r\n\r\nThese signs of growth soon gave way to signs of decay and depopulation.\r\nChief among the causes of ruin were the taxes, increased enormously\r\nduring the sixteenth century. Property taxes, said to have increased 30\r\nper cent, ruined farmers, and the \"alcabala,\" or tax on commodities\r\nbought and sold, was increased until merchants went out of business,\r\nand many an industrial establishment closed its doors rather than pay\r\nthe taxes. Industry and commerce, already diseased, were almost\r\ncompletely killed by the expulsion of the Jews (1492) and of the Moors\r\n(1609), who had been respectively the bankers and the manufacturers of\r\nSpain. Spanish gold now went to the English and Dutch smugglers who\r\nsupplied the peninsula with manufactures, and German bankers became the\r\nfinanciers of the realm.\r\n\r\nThe crowning misfortune was the revolt of the Netherlands, the richest\r\nprovinces of the whole empire. Some of the wealthiest cities of Europe\r\nwere situated in the Netherlands. Bruges had once been a great city,\r\nand in 1566 was still able to buy nearly $2,000,000 worth of wool to\r\nfeed its looms; but as a commercial and financial center, the Flemish\r\ncity of Antwerp had taken first place. In 1566 it was said that 300\r\nships and as many wagons arrived daily with rich cargoes to be bought\r\nand sold by the thousand commercial houses of Antwerp. Antwerp was the\r\nheart through which the money of Europe flowed. Through the bankers of\r\nAntwerp a French king might borrow money of a Turkish pasha. Yet\r\nAntwerp was only the greatest among the many cities of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nCharles V, king of Spain during the first half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, had found in the Netherlands his richest source of income, and\r\nhad wisely done all in his power to preserve their prosperity. As we\r\nshall see in Chapter III, the governors appointed by King Philip II in\r\nthe second half of the sixteenth century lost the love of the people by\r\nthe harsh measures against the Protestants, and ruined commerce and\r\nindustry by imposing taxes of 5 and 10 per cent on every sale of land\r\nor goods. In 1566 the Netherlands rose in revolt, and after many bloody\r\nbattles, the northern or Dutch provinces succeeded in breaking away\r\nfrom Spanish rule.\r\n\r\nSpain had not only lost the little Dutch provinces; Flanders was\r\nruined: its fields lay waste, its weavers had emigrated to England, its\r\ncommerce to Amsterdam. Commercial supremacy never returned to Antwerp\r\nafter the \"Spanish Fury\" of 1576. Moreover, during the war Dutch\r\nsailors had captured most of the former possessions of Portugal, and\r\nEnglish sea-power, beginning in mere piratical attacks on Spanish\r\ntreasure-fleets, had become firmly established. The finest part of\r\nNorth America was claimed by the English and French. Of her world\r\nempire, Spain retained only Central and South America (except Brazil),\r\nMexico, California, Florida, most of the West Indies, and in the East\r\nthe Philippine Islands and part of Borneo.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dutch Sea Power]\r\n\r\nThe Dutch, driven to sea by the limited resources of their narrow strip\r\nof coastland, had begun their maritime career as fishermen \"exchanging\r\ntons of herring for tons of gold.\" In the sixteenth century they had\r\nbuilt up a considerable carrying trade, bringing cloth, tar, timber,\r\nand grain to Spain and France, and distributing to the Baltic countries\r\nthe wines and liquors and other products of southwestern Europe, in\r\naddition to wares from the Portuguese East Indies.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch traders had purchased their Eastern wares largely from\r\nPortuguese merchants in the port of Lisbon. Two circumstances--the\r\nunion of Spain with Portugal in 1580 and the revolt of the Netherlands\r\nfrom Spain--combined to give the Dutch their great opportunity. In 1594\r\nthe port of Lisbon was closed to Dutch merchants. The following year\r\nthe Dutch made their first voyage to India, and, long jealous of the\r\nPortuguese colonial possessions, they began systematically to make the\r\ntrade with the Spice Islands their own. By 1602, 65 Dutch ships had\r\nbeen to India. In the thirteen years--1602 to 1615--they captured 545\r\nPortuguese and Spanish ships, seized ports on the coasts of Africa and\r\nIndia, and established themselves in the Spice Islands. In addition to\r\nmost of the old Portuguese empire,--ports in Africa and India, Malacca,\r\nOceanica, and Brazil, [Footnote: Brazil was more or less under Dutch\r\ncontrol from 1624 until 1654, when, through an uprising of Portuguese\r\ncolonists, the country was fully recovered by Portugal. Holland\r\nrecognized the Portuguese ownership of Brazil by treaty of 1662, and\r\nthenceforth the Dutch retained in South America only a portion of\r\nGuiana (Surinam).]--the Dutch had acquired a foothold in North America\r\nby the discoveries of Henry Hudson in 1609 and by settlement in 1621.\r\nTheir colonists along the Hudson River called the new territory New\r\nNetherland and the town on Manhattan island New Amsterdam, but when\r\nCharles II of England seized the land in 1664, he renamed it New York.\r\n\r\nThus the Dutch had succeeded to the colonial empire of the Portuguese.\r\nWith their increased power they were able entirely to usurp the Baltic\r\ntrade from the hands of the Hanseatic (German) merchants, who had\r\nincurred heavy losses by the injury to their interests in Antwerp\r\nduring the sixteenth century. Throughout the seventeenth century the\r\nDutch almost monopolized the carrying-trade from Asia and between\r\nsouthwestern Europe and the Baltic. The prosperity of the Dutch was the\r\nenvy of all Europe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beginnings of English and French Explorations]\r\n\r\nIt took the whole sixteenth century for the English and French to get\r\nthoroughly into the colonial contest. During that period the activities\r\nof the English were confined to exploration and piracy, with the\r\nexception of the ill-starred attempts of Gilbert and Raleigh to\r\ncolonize Newfoundland and North Carolina. The voyages of the Anglo-\r\nItalian John Cabot in 1497-1498 were later to be the basis of British\r\nclaims to North America. The search for a northwest passage drove\r\nFrobisher (1576-1578), Davis (1585-1587), Hudson (1610-1611), and\r\nBaffin (1616) to explore the northern extremity of North America, to\r\nleave the record of their exploits in names of bays, islands, and\r\nstraits, and to establish England's claim to northern Canada; while the\r\nsearch for a northeast passage enticed Willoughby and Chancellor (1553)\r\naround Lapland, and Jenkinson (1557-1558) to the icebound port of\r\nArchangel in northern Russia. Elizabethan England had neither silver\r\nmines nor spice islands, but the deficiency was never felt while\r\nBritish privateers sailed the seas. Hawkins, the great slaver, Drake,\r\nthe second circumnavigator of the globe, Davis, and Cavendish were but\r\nfour of the bold captains who towed home many a stately Spanish galleon\r\nladen with silver plate and with gold. As for spices, the English East\r\nIndia Company, chartered in 1600, was soon to build up an empire in the\r\nEast in competition with the Portuguese, the Dutch, and the French, but\r\nthat story belongs to a later chapter.\r\n\r\nFrance was less active. The rivalry of Francis I [Footnote: See below,\r\npp. 77 ff.] with Charles I of Spain had extended even to the New World.\r\nVerrazano (1524) sailed the coast from Carolina to Labrador, and\r\nCartier (1534-1535) pushed up the Saint Lawrence to Montreal, looking\r\nfor a northwest passage, and demonstrating that France had no respect\r\nfor the Spanish claim to all America. After 1535, however, nothing of\r\npermanence was done until the end of the century, and the founding of\r\nFrench colonies in India and along the Saint Lawrence and Mississippi\r\nrivers belongs rather to the history of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Motives for Colonization]\r\n\r\nOne of the most amazing spectacles in history is the expansion of\r\nEurope since the sixteenth century. Not resting content with\r\ndiscovering the rest of the world, the European nations with sublime\r\nconfidence pressed on to divide the new continents among them, to\r\nconquer, Christianize, and civilize the natives, and to send out\r\nmillions of new emigrants to establish beyond the seas a New England, a\r\nNew France, a New Spain, and a New Netherland. The Spaniards in Spain\r\nto-day are far outnumbered by the Spanish-speaking people in Argentina,\r\nChili, Peru, Venezuela, Colombia, Central America, and the Philippine\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Religion]\r\n\r\nIt was not merely greed for gold and thirst for glory which inspired\r\nthe colonizing movement. To the merchant's eager search for precious\r\nmetals and costly spices, and to the adventurer's fierce delight in\r\nbraving unknown dangers where white man never had ventured, the\r\nPortuguese and Spanish explorers added the inspiration of an ennobling\r\nmissionary ideal. In the conquest of the New World priests and chapels\r\nwere as important as soldiers and fortresses; and its settlements were\r\nnamed in honor of Saint Francis (San Francisco), Saint Augustine (St.\r\nAugustine), the Holy Saviour (San Salvador), the Holy Cross (Santa\r\nCruz), or the Holy Faith (Santa Fé). Fearless priests penetrated the\r\ninterior of America, preaching and baptizing as they went.\r\nUnfortunately some of the Spanish adventurers who came to make fortunes\r\nin the mines of America, and a great number of the non-Spanish\r\nforeigners who owned mines in the Spanish colonies, set gain before\r\nreligion, and imposed crushing burdens on the natives who toiled as\r\nslaves in their mines. Cruelty and forced labor decimated the natives,\r\nbut in the course of time this abuse was remedied, thanks largely to\r\nthe Spanish bishop, Bartolomé de las Casas, and instead of forming a\r\nmiserable remnant of an almost extinct race, as they do in the United\r\nStates, the Indians freely intermarried with the Spaniards, whom they\r\nalways outnumbered. As a result, Latin America is peopled by nations\r\nwhich are predominantly Indian in blood, [Footnote: Except in the\r\nsouthern part of South America.] Spanish or Portuguese [Footnote: In\r\nBrazil.] in language, and Roman Catholic in religion.\r\n\r\nThe same religious zeal which had actuated Spanish missionary-explorers\r\nwas manifested at a later date by the French Jesuit Fathers who\r\npenetrated North America in order to preach the Christian faith to the\r\nIndians. Quite different were the religious motives which in the\r\nseventeenth century inspired Protestant colonists in the New World.\r\nThey came not as evangelists, but as religious outcasts fleeing from\r\npersecution, or as restless souls worsted at politics or unable to gain\r\na living at home. This meant the dispossession and ultimate extinction\r\nrather than the conversion of the Indians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decline of the Hanseatic League]\r\n\r\nThe stirring story of the colonial struggles which occupied the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries will be taken up in another\r\nchapter; at this point, therefore, we turn from the expanding nations\r\non the Atlantic seaboard to note the mournful plight of the older\r\ncommercial powers--the German and Italian city-states. As for the\r\nformer, the Hanseatic League, despoiled of its Baltic commerce by\r\nenterprising Dutch and English merchants, its cities restless and\r\nrebellious, gradually broke up. In 1601 an Englishman metaphorically\r\nobserved: \"Most of their [the league's] teeth have fallen out, the rest\r\nsit but loosely in their head,\"--and in fact all were soon lost except\r\nLübeck, Bremen, and Hamburg.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decay of Venice]\r\n\r\nLess rapid, but no less striking, was the decay of Venice and the other\r\nItalian cities. The first cargoes brought by the Portuguese from India\r\ncaused the price of pepper and spices to fall to a degree which spelled\r\nruin for the Venetians. The Turks continued to harry Italian traders in\r\nthe Levant, and the Turkish sea-power grew to menacing proportions,\r\nuntil in 1571 Venice had to appeal to Spain for help. To the terror of\r\nthe Turk was added the torment of the Barbary pirates, who from the\r\nnorthern coast of Africa frequently descended upon Italian seaports.\r\nThe commerce of Venice was ruined. The brilliance of Venice in art and\r\nliterature lasted through another century (the seventeenth), supported\r\non the ruins of Venetian opulence; but the splendor of Venice was\r\nextinguished finally in the turbulent sea of political intrigue into\r\nwhich the rest of Italy had already sunk.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF THE COMMERCIAL REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nIn a way, all of the colonizing movements, which we have been at pains\r\nto trace, might be regarded as the first and greatest result of the\r\nCommercial Revolution--that is, if by the Commercial Revolution one\r\nunderstands simply the discovery of new trade-routes; but, as it is\r\ndifficult to separate explorations from colonization, we have used the\r\nterm \"Commercial Revolution\" to include both. By the Commercial\r\nRevolution we mean that expansive movement by which European commerce\r\nescaped from the narrow confines of the Mediterranean and encompassed\r\nthe whole world. We shall proceed now to consider that movement in its\r\nsecondary aspects or effects.\r\n\r\nOne of the first in importance of these effects was the advent of a new\r\npolitico-economic doctrinemercantilism--the result of the transference\r\nof commercial supremacy from Italian and German city-states to national\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nationalism in Commerce]\r\n\r\nWith the declining Italian and German commercial cities, the era of\r\nmunicipal commerce passed away forever. In the peoples of the Atlantic\r\nseaboard, who now became masters of the seas, national consciousness\r\nalready was strongly developed, and centralized governments were\r\nperfected; these nations carried the national spirit into commerce.\r\nPortugal and Spain owed their colonial empires to the enterprise of\r\ntheir royal families; Holland gained a trade route as an incident of\r\nher struggle for national independence; England and France, which were\r\nto become the great commercial rivals of the eighteenth century, were\r\nthe two strongest national monarchies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mercantilism]\r\n\r\nThe new nations founded their power not on the fearlessness of their\r\nchevaliers, but on the extent of their financial resources. Wealth was\r\nneeded to arm and to pay the soldiers, wealth to build warships, wealth\r\nto bribe diplomats. And since this wealth must come from the people by\r\ntaxes, it was essential to have a people prosperous enough to pay\r\ntaxes. The wealth of the nation must be the primary consideration of\r\nthe legislators. In endeavoring to cultivate and preserve the wealth of\r\ntheir subjects, European monarchs proceeded upon the assumption that if\r\na nation exported costly manufactures to its own colonies and imported\r\ncheap raw materials from them, the money paid into the home country for\r\nmanufactures would more than counterbalance the money paid out for raw\r\nmaterials, and this \"favorable balance of trade\" would bring gold to\r\nthe nation. This economic theory and the system based upon it are\r\ncalled mercantilism. In order to establish such a balance of trade, the\r\ngovernment might either forbid or heavily tax the importation of\r\nmanufactures from abroad, might prohibit the export of raw materials,\r\nmight subsidize the export of manufactures, and might attempt by minute\r\nregulations to foster industry at home as well as to discourage\r\ncompetition in the colonies. Thus, intending to retain the profits of\r\ncommerce for Englishmen, Cromwell and later rulers required that\r\ncertain goods must be carried on English ships.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chartered Companies]\r\n\r\nBy far the most popular method of developing a lucrative colonial\r\ntrade--especially towards the end of the sixteenth and throughout the\r\nseventeenth century--was by means of chartered commercial companies.\r\nEngland (in 1600), Holland (in 1602), France (in 1664), Sweden,\r\nDenmark, Scotland, and Prussia each chartered its own \"East India\r\nCompany.\" The English possessions on the Atlantic coast of America were\r\nshared by the London and Plymouth Companies (1606). English companies\r\nfor trade with Russia, Turkey, Morocco, Guiana, Bermuda, the Canaries,\r\nand Hudson Bay were organized and reorganized with bewildering\r\nactivity. In France the crop of commercial companies was no less\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\nTo each of these companies was assigned the exclusive right to trade\r\nwith and to govern the inhabitants of a particular colony, with the\r\nprivilege and duty of defending the same. Sometimes the companies were\r\nrequired to pay money into the royal treasury, or on the other hand, if\r\nthe enterprise were a difficult one, a company might be supported by\r\nroyal subsidies. The Dutch West India Company (1621) was authorized to\r\nbuild forts, maintain troops, and make war on land and sea; the\r\ngovernment endowed the company with one million florins, sixteen ships,\r\nfour yachts, and exemption from all tolls and license dues on its\r\nvessels. The English East India Company, first organized in 1600,\r\nconducted the conquest and government of India for more than two\r\ncenturies, before its administrative power was taken away in 1858.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Financial Methods.]\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Regulated Company\"]\r\n\r\nThe great commercial companies were a new departure in business method.\r\nIn the middle ages business had been carried on mostly by individuals\r\nor by partnerships, the partners being, as a rule, members of the same\r\nfamily. After the expansion of commerce, trading with another country\r\nnecessitated building forts and equipping fleets for protection against\r\nsavages, pirates, or other nations. Since this could not be\r\naccomplished with the limited resources of a few individuals, it was\r\nnecessary to form large companies in which many investors shared\r\nexpense and risk. Some had been created for European trade, but the\r\nimportant growth of such companies was for distant trade. Their first\r\nform was the \"regulated company.\" Each member would contribute to the\r\ngeneral fund for such expenses as building forts; and certain rules\r\nwould be made for the governance of all. Subject to these rules, each\r\nmerchant traded as he pleased, and there was no pooling of profits. The\r\nregulated company, the first form of the commercial company, was\r\nencouraged by the king. He could charter such a company, grant it a\r\nmonopoly over a certain district, and trust it to develop the trade as\r\nno individual could, and there was no evasion of taxes as by\r\nindependent merchants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Joint-stock Company]\r\n\r\nAfter a decade or so, many of the regulated companies found that their\r\nmembers often pursued individual advantage to the detriment of the\r\ncompany's interests, and it was thought that, taken altogether, profits\r\nwould be greater and the risk less, if all should contribute to a\r\ncommon treasury, intrusting to the most able members the direction of\r\nthe business for the benefit of all. Then each would receive a dividend\r\nor part of the profits proportional to his share in the general\r\ntreasury or \"joint stock.\" The idea that while the company as a whole\r\nwas permanent each individual could buy or sell \"shares\" in the joint\r\nstock, helped to make such \"joint-stock\" companies very popular after\r\nthe opening of the seventeenth century. The English East India Company,\r\norganized as a regulated company in 1600, was reorganized piecemeal for\r\nhalf a century until it acquired the form of a joint-stock enterprise;\r\nmost of the other chartered colonial companies followed the same plan.\r\nIn these early stock-companies we find the germ of the most\r\ncharacteristic of present-day business institutions--the corporation.\r\nIn the seventeenth century this form of business organization, then in\r\nits rudimentary stages, as yet had not been applied to industry, nor\r\nhad sad experience yet revealed the lengths to which corrupt\r\ncorporation directors might go.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Banking]\r\n\r\nThe development of the joint-stock company was attended by increased\r\nactivity in banking. In the early middle ages the lending of money for\r\ninterest had been forbidden by the Catholic Church; in this as in other\r\nbranches of business it was immoral to receive profit without giving\r\nwork. The Jews, however, with no such scruples, had found money-lending\r\nvery profitable, even though royal debtors occasionally refused to pay.\r\nAs business developed in Italy, however, Christians lost their\r\nrepugnance to interest-taking, and Italian (Lombard) and later French\r\nand German money-lenders and money-changers became famous. Since the\r\ncoins minted by feudal lords and kings were hard to pass except in\r\nlimited districts, and since the danger of counterfeit or light-weight\r\ncoins was far greater than now, the \"money-changers\" who would buy and\r\nsell the coins of different countries did a thriving business at\r\nAntwerp in the early sixteenth century. Later, Amsterdam, London,\r\nHamburg, and Frankfort took over the business of Antwerp and developed\r\nthe institutions of finance to a higher degree. [Footnote: The gold of\r\nthe New World and the larger scope of commercial enterprises had\r\nincreased the scale of operations, as may be seen by comparing the\r\nfortunes of three great banking families: 1300--the Peruzzi's,\r\n$800,000; 1440--the Medici's, $7,500,000; 1546--the Fuggers',\r\n$40,000,000.] The money-lenders became bankers, paying interest on\r\ndeposits and receiving higher interest on loans. Shares of the stock of\r\ncommercial companies were bought and sold in exchanges, and as early as\r\n1542 there were complaints about speculating on the rise and fall of\r\nstocks.\r\n\r\nWithin a comparatively short time the medieval merchants' gilds had\r\ngiven way to great stock-companies, and Jewish money-lenders to\r\nmillionaire bankers and banking houses with many of our instruments of\r\nexchange such as the bill of exchange. Such was the revolution in\r\nbusiness that attended, and that was partly caused, partly helped, by\r\nthe changes in foreign trade, which we call the Commercial Revolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New Commodities]\r\n\r\nNot only was foreign trade changed from the south and east of Europe to\r\nthe west, from the city-states to nations, from land-routes to ocean-\r\nroutes; but the vessels which sailed the Atlantic were larger,\r\nstronger, and more numerous, and they sailed with amazing confidence\r\nand safety, as compared with the fragile caravels and galleys of a few\r\ncenturies before. The cargoes they carried had changed too. The\r\ncomparative cheapness of water-transportation had made it possible\r\nprofitably to carry grain and meat, as well as costly luxuries of small\r\nbulk such as spices and silks. Manufactures were an important item.\r\nMoreover, new commodities came into commerce, such as tea and coffee.\r\nThe Americas sent to Europe the potato, \"Indian\" corn, tobacco, cocoa,\r\ncane-sugar (hitherto scarce), molasses, rice, rum, fish, whale-oil and\r\nwhalebone, dye-woods and timber and furs; Europe sent back\r\nmanufactures, luxuries, and slaves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Slavery]\r\n\r\nSlaves had been articles of commerce since time immemorial; at the end\r\nof the fifteenth century there were said to have been 3000 in Venice;\r\nand the Portuguese had enslaved some Africans before 1500. But the need\r\nfor cheap labor in the mines and on the sugar and tobacco plantations\r\nof the New World gave the slave-trade a new and tremendous impetus. The\r\nSpaniards began early to enslave the natives of America, although the\r\npractice was opposed by the noble endeavors of the Dominican friar and\r\nbishop, Bartolomé de las Casas. But the native population was not\r\nsufficient,--or, as in the English colonies, the Indians were\r\nexterminated rather than enslaved,--and in the sixteenth century it was\r\ndeemed necessary to import negroes from Africa. The trade in African\r\nnegroes was fathered by the English captain Hawkins, and fostered alike\r\nby English and Dutch. It proved highly lucrative, and it was long\r\nbefore the trade yielded to the better judgment of civilized nations,\r\nand still longer before the institution of slavery could be eradicated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effects on Industry and Agriculture]\r\n\r\nThe expansion of trade was the strongest possible stimulus to\r\nagriculture and industry. New industries--such as the silk and cotton\r\nmanufacture--grew up outside of the antiquated gild system. The old\r\nindustries, especially the English woolen industry, grew to new\r\nimportance and often came under the control of the newer and more\r\npowerful merchants who conducted a wholesale business in a single\r\ncommodity, such as cloth. Capitalists had their agents buy wool, dole\r\nit out to spinners and weavers who were paid so much for a given amount\r\nof work, and then sell the finished product. This was called the\r\n\"domestic system,\" because the work was done at home, or\r\n\"capitalistic,\" because raw material and finished product were owned\r\nnot by the man who worked them, but by a \"capitalist\" or rich merchant.\r\nHow these changing conditions were dealt with by mercantilist\r\nstatesmen, we shall see in later chapters.\r\n\r\nThe effect on agriculture had been less direct but no less real. The\r\nland had to be tilled with greater care to produce grain sufficient to\r\nsupport populous cities and to ship to foreign ports. Countries were\r\nnow more inclined to specialize--France in wine, England in wool--and\r\nso certain branches of production grew more important. The introduction\r\nof new crops produced no more remarkable results than in Ireland where\r\nthe potato, transplanted from America, became a staple in the Irish\r\ndiet: \"Irish potatoes\" in common parlance attest the completeness of\r\ndomestication.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Significance of Commercial Revolution]\r\n\r\nIn the preceding pages we have attempted to study particular effects of\r\nthe Commercial Revolution (in the broad sense including the expansion\r\nof commerce as well as the change of trade-routes), such as the decline\r\nof Venice and of the Hanse, the formation of colonial empires, the rise\r\nof commercial companies, the expansion of banking, the introduction of\r\nnew articles of commerce, and the development of agriculture and\r\nindustry. In each particular the change was noticeable and important.\r\n\r\nBut the Commercial Revolution possesses a more general significance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Europeanization of the World]\r\n\r\n(1) It was the Commercial Revolution that started Europe on her career\r\nof world conquest. The petty, quarrelsome feudal states of the smallest\r\nof five continents have become the Powers of to-day, dividing up\r\nAfrica, Asia, and America, founding empires greater and more lasting\r\nthan that of Alexander. The colonists of Europe imparted their language\r\nto South America and made of North America a second Europe with a\r\ncommon cultural heritage. The explorers, missionaries, and merchants of\r\nEurope have penetrated all lands, bringing in their train European\r\nmanners, dress, and institutions. They are still at work Europeanizing\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 2. Increase of Wealth, Knowledge, and Comfort]\r\n\r\n(2) The expansion of commerce meant the increase of wealth, knowledge,\r\nand comfort. All the continents heaped their treasures in the lap of\r\nEurope. Knowledge of the New World, with its many peoples, products,\r\nand peculiarities, tended to dispel the silly notions of medieval\r\nignorance; and the goods of every land were brought for the comfort of\r\nthe European--American timber for his house, Persian rugs for his\r\nfloors, Indian ebony for his table, Irish linen to cover it, Peruvian\r\nsilver for his fork, Chinese tea, sweetened with sugar from Cuba.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 3. The Rise of the Bourgeoisie]\r\n\r\n(3) This new comfort, knowledge, and wealth went not merely to nobles\r\nand prelates; it was noticeable most of all in a new class, the\r\n\"bourgeoisie.\" In the towns of Europe lived bankers, merchants, and\r\nshop-keepers,--intelligent, able, and wealthy enough to live like kings\r\nor princes. These bourgeois or townspeople (_bourg_ = town) were\r\nto grow in intelligence, in wealth, and in political influence; they\r\nwere destined to precipitate revolutions in industry and politics,\r\nthereby establishing their individual rule over factories, and their\r\ncollective rule over legislatures.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL READING\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL.

The father occupies the\r\ncenter of the stage during the first half of the century; the son,\r\nduring the second half.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extensive Dominions of Charles]\r\n\r\nAt Ghent in the Netherlands, Charles was born in 1500 of illustrious\r\nparentage. His father was Philip of Habsburg, son of the Emperor\r\nMaximilian and Mary, duchess of Burgundy. His mother was the Infanta\r\nJoanna, daughter and heiress of Ferdinand of Aragon and Naples and\r\nIsabella of Castile and the Indies. The death of his father and the\r\nincapacity of his mother--she had become insane--left Charles at the\r\ntender age of six years an orphan under the guardianship of his\r\ngrandfathers Maximilian and Ferdinand. The death of the latter in 1516\r\ntransferred the whole Spanish inheritance to Charles, and three years\r\nlater, by the death of the former, he came into possession of the\r\nhereditary dominions of the Habsburgs. Thus under a youth of nineteen\r\nyears were grouped wider lands and greater populations than any\r\nChristian sovereign had ever ruled. Vienna, Amsterdam, Antwerp,\r\nBrussels, Milan, Naples, Madrid, Cadiz,--even the City of Mexico,--owed\r\nhim allegiance. His titles alone would fill several pages.\r\n\r\nMaximilian had intended not only that all these lands should pass into\r\nthe hands of the Habsburg family, but also that his grandson should\r\nsucceed him as head of the Holy Roman Empire. This ambition, however,\r\nwas hard of fulfillment, because the French king, Francis I (1515-\r\n1547), feared the encircling of his own country by a united German-\r\nSpanish-Italian state, and set himself to preserve what he called the\r\n\"Balance of Power\"--preventing the undue growth of one political power\r\nat the expense of others. It was only by means of appeal to national\r\nand family sentiment and the most wholesale bribery that Charles\r\nmanaged to secure a majority of the electors' votes against his French\r\nrival [Footnote: Henry VIII of England was also a candidate.] and\r\nthereby to acquire the coveted imperial title. He was crowned at Aix-\r\nla-Chapelle in his twenty-first year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Charles]\r\n\r\nNever have greater difficulties confronted a sovereign than those which\r\nCharles V was obliged to face throughout his reign; never did monarch\r\nlead a more strenuous life. He was the central figure in a very\r\ncritical period of history: his own character as well as the\r\npainstaking education he had received in the Netherlands conferred upon\r\nhim a lively appreciation of his position and a dogged pertinacity in\r\ndischarging its obligations. Both in administering his extensive\r\ndominions and in dealing with foreign foes, Charles was a zealous,\r\nhard-working, and calculating prince, and the lack of success which\r\nattended many of his projects was due not to want of ability in the\r\nruler but to the multiplicity of interests among the ruled. The emperor\r\nmust do too many things to allow of his doing any one thing well.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difficulties Confronting Charles]\r\n\r\nSuppose we turn over in our minds some of the chief problems of Charles\r\nV, for they will serve to explain much of the political history of the\r\nsixteenth century. In the first place, the emperor was confronted with\r\nextraordinary difficulties in governing his territories. Each one of\r\nthe seventeen provinces of the Netherlands--the country which he always\r\nconsidered peculiarly his own--was a distinct political unit, for there\r\nexisted only the rudiments of a central administration and a common\r\nrepresentative system, while the county of Burgundy had a separate\r\npolitical organization. The crown of Castile brought with it the\r\nrecently conquered kingdom of Granada, together with the new colonies\r\nin America and scattered posts in northern Africa. The crown of Aragon\r\ncomprised the four distinct states of Aragon, Valencia, Catalonia, and\r\nNavarre, [Footnote: The part south of the Pyrenees. See above, p. 8.]\r\nand, in addition, the kingdoms of Naples, Sicily, and Sardinia, each\r\nwith its own customs and government. At least eight independent cortes\r\nor parliaments existed in this Spanish-Italian group, adding greatly to\r\nthe intricacy of administration. Much the same was true of that other\r\nHabsburg group of states,--Austria, Styria, Carniola, Carinthia, the\r\nTyrol, etc., but Charles soon freed himself from immediate\r\nresponsibility for their government by intrusting them (1521) to his\r\nyounger brother, Ferdinand, who by his own marriage and elections added\r\nthe kingdoms of Bohemia [Footnote: Including the Bohemian crown lands\r\nof Moravia and Silesia.] and Hungary (1526) to the Habsburg dominions.\r\nThe Empire afforded additional problems: it made serious demands upon\r\nthe time, money, and energies of its ruler; in return, it gave little\r\nbut glamour. In all these regions Charles had to do with financial,\r\njudicial, and ecclesiastical matters. He had to reconcile conflicting\r\ninterests and appeal for popularity to many varied races. More than\r\nonce during his reign he even had to repress rebellion. In Germany,\r\nfrom his very first Diet in 1521, he was face to face with rising\r\nProtestantism which seemed to him to blaspheme his altar and to assail\r\nhis throne.\r\n\r\nThe emperor's overwhelming administrative difficulties were complicated\r\nat every turn by the intricacies of foreign politics. In the first\r\nplace, Charles was obliged to wage war with France throughout the\r\ngreater part of his reign; he had inherited a longstanding quarrel with\r\nthe French kings, to which the rivalry of Francis I for the empire gave\r\na personal aspect. In the second place, and almost as formidable, was\r\nthe advance of the Turks up the Danube and the increase of Mohammedan\r\nnaval power in the Mediterranean. Against Protestant Germany a Catholic\r\nmonarch might hope to rely on papal assistance, and English support\r\nmight conceivably be enlisted against France. But the popes, who\r\nusually disliked the emperor's Italian policy, were not of great aid to\r\nhim elsewhere; and the English sovereigns had domestic reasons for\r\ndeveloping hostility to Charles. A brief sketch of the foreign affairs\r\nof Charles may make the situation clear.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Francis I of France and the Reasons for his Wars with the\r\nEmperor Charles V]\r\n\r\nSix years older than Charles, Francis I had succeeded to the French\r\nthrone in 1515, irresponsible, frivolous, and vain of military\r\nreputation. The general political situation of the time,--the gradual\r\ninclosure of the French monarchy by a string of Habsburg territories,--\r\nto say nothing of the remarkable contrast between the character of\r\nFrancis and that of the persevering Charles, made a great conflict\r\ninevitable, and definite pretexts were not lacking for an early\r\noutbreak of hostilities. (1) Francis revived the claims of the French\r\ncrown to Naples, although Louis XII had renounced them in 1504. (2)\r\nFrancis, bent on regaining Milan, which his predecessor had lost in\r\n1512, invaded the duchy and, after winning the brilliant victory of\r\nMarignano in the first year of his reign, occupied the city of Milan.\r\nCharles subsequently insisted, however, that the duchy was a fief of\r\nthe Holy Roman Empire and that he was sworn by oath to recover it. (3)\r\nFrancis asserted the claims of a kinsman to the little kingdom of\r\nNavarre, the greater part of which, it will be remembered, had recently\r\n[Footnote: In 1512. See above.] been forcibly annexed to Spain. (4)\r\nFrancis desired to extend his sway over the rich French-speaking\r\nprovinces of the Netherlands, while Charles was determined not only to\r\nprevent further aggressions but to recover the duchy of Burgundy of\r\nwhich his grandmother had been deprived by Louis XI. (5) The outcome of\r\nthe contest for the imperial crown in 1519 virtually completed the\r\nbreach between the two rivals. War broke out in 1521, and with few\r\ninterruptions it was destined to outlast the lives of both Francis and\r\nCharles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Italian Wars of Charles V and Francis I]\r\n\r\nItaly was the main theater of the combat. In the first stage, the\r\nimperial forces, with the aid of a papal army, speedily drove the\r\nFrench garrison out of Milan. The Sforza family  was duly invested with\r\nthe duchy as a fief of the Empire, and the pope was compensated by the\r\naddition of Parma and Piacenza to the Patrimony of Saint Peter. The\r\nvictorious Imperialists then pressed across the Alps and besieged\r\nMarseilles. Francis, who had been detained by domestic troubles in\r\nFrance, [Footnote: These troubles related to the disposition of the\r\nimportant landed estates of the Bourbon family. The duke of Bourbon,\r\nwho was constable of France, felt himself injured by the king and\r\naccordingly deserted to the emperor.] now succeeded in raising the\r\nsiege and pursued the retreating enemy to Milan. Instead of following\r\nup his advantage by promptly attacking the main army of the\r\nImperialists, the French king dispatched a part of his force to Naples,\r\nand with the other turned aside to blockade the city of Pavia. This\r\nblunder enabled the Imperialists to reform their ranks and to march\r\ntowards Pavia in order to join the besieged. Here on 24 February,\r\n1525,--the emperor's twenty-fifth birthday,--the army of Charles won an\r\noverwhelming victory. Eight thousand French soldiers fell on the field\r\nthat day, and Francis, who had been in the thick of the fight, was\r\ncompelled to surrender. \"No thing in the world is left me save my honor\r\nand my life,\" wrote the king to his mother. Everything seemed\r\nauspicious for the cause of Charles. Francis, after a brief captivity\r\nin Spain, was released on condition that he would surrender all claims\r\nto Burgundy, the Netherlands, and Italy, and would marry the emperor's\r\nsister.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sack of Rome, 1527]\r\n\r\nFrancis swore upon the Gospels and upon his knightly word that he would\r\nfulfill these conditions, but in his own and contemporary opinion the\r\ncompulsion exercised upon him absolved him from his oath. No sooner was\r\nhe back in France than he declared the treaty null and void and\r\nproceeded to form alliances with all the Italian powers that had become\r\nalarmed by the sudden strengthening of the emperor's position in the\r\npeninsula,--the pope, Venice, Florence, and even the Sforza who owed\r\neverything to Charles. Upon the resumption of hostilities the league\r\ndisplayed the same want of agreement and energy which characterized\r\nevery coalition of Italian city-states; and soon the Imperialists were\r\nable to possess themselves of much of the country. In 1527 occurred a\r\nfamous episode--the sack of Rome. It was not displeasing to the emperor\r\nthat the pope should be punished for giving aid to France, although\r\nCharles cannot be held altogether responsible for what befell. His army\r\nin Italy, composed largely of Spaniards and Germans, being short of\r\nfood and money, and without orders, mutinied and marched upon the\r\nEternal City, which was soon at their mercy. About four thousand people\r\nperished in the capture. The pillage lasted nine months, and the\r\nbrigands were halted only by a frightful pestilence which decimated\r\ntheir numbers. Convents were forced, altars stripped, tombs profaned,\r\nthe library of the Vatican sacked, and works of art torn down as\r\nmonuments of idolatry. Pope Clement VII (1523-1534), a nephew of the\r\nother Medici pope, Leo X, had taken refuge in the impregnable castle of\r\nSt. Angelo and was now obliged to make peace with the emperor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peace of Cambrai, 1529]\r\n\r\nThe sack of Rome aroused bitter feelings throughout Catholic Europe,\r\nand Henry VIII of England, at that time still loyal to the pope,\r\nostentatiously sent aid to Francis. But although the emperor made\r\nlittle headway against Francis, the French king, on account of\r\nstrategic blunders and the disunion of the league, was unable to\r\nmaintain a sure foothold in Italy. The peace of Cambrai (1529) provided\r\nthat Francis should abandon Naples, Milan, and the Netherlands, but the\r\ncession of Burgundy was no longer insisted upon. Francis proceeded to\r\ncelebrate his marriage with the emperor's sister.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Habsburg Predominance in Italy]\r\n\r\nEight years of warfare had left Charles V and the Habsburg family\r\nunquestionable masters of Italy. Naples was under Charles's direct\r\ngovernment. For Milan he received the homage of Sforza. The Medici\r\npope, whose family he had restored in Florence, was now his ally.\r\nCharles visited Italy for the first time in 1529 to view his\r\nterritories, and at Bologna (1530) received from the pope's hands the\r\nancient iron crown of Lombard Italy and the imperial crown of Rome. It\r\nwas the last papal coronation of a ruler of the Holy Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nThe peace of Cambrai proved but a truce, and war between Charles and\r\nFrancis repeatedly blazed forth. Francis made strange alliances in\r\norder to create all possible trouble for the emperor,--Scotland,\r\nSweden, Denmark, the Ottoman Turks, even the rebellious Protestant\r\nprinces within the empire. There were spasmodic campaigns between 1536\r\nand 1538 and between 1542 and 1544, and after the death of Francis and\r\nthe abdication of Charles, the former's son, Henry II (1547-1559),\r\ncontinued the conflict, newly begun in 1552, until the conclusion of\r\nthe treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis in 1559, by which the Habsburgs retained\r\ntheir hold upon Italy, while France, by the occupation of the important\r\nbishoprics of Metz, Toul, and Verdun, extended her northeastern\r\nfrontier, at the expense of the empire, toward the Rhine River.\r\n[Footnote: It was during this war that in 1558 the French captured\r\nCalais from the English, and thus put an end to English territorial\r\nholdings on the Continent. The English Queen Mary was the wife of\r\nPhilip II of Spain.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Results of the Wars between Charles V and Francis I]\r\n\r\nIndirectly, the long wars occasioned by the personal rivalry of Charles\r\nand Francis had other results than Habsburg predominance in Italy and\r\nFrench expansion towards the Rhine. They preserved a \"balance of power\"\r\nand prevented the incorporation of the French monarchy into an\r\nobsolescent empire. They rendered easier the rise of the Ottoman power\r\nin eastern Europe; and French alliance with the Turks gave French trade\r\nand enterprise a decided lead in the Levant. They also permitted the\r\ncomparatively free growth of Protestantism in Germany.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Turkish Peril]\r\n\r\nMore sinister to Charles V than his wars with the French was the\r\nadvance of the Ottoman Turks. Under their greatest sultan, Suleiman II,\r\nthe Magnificent (1520-1566), a contemporary of Charles, the Turks were\r\nrapidly extending their sway. The Black Sea was practically a Turkish\r\nlake; and the whole Euphrates valley, with Bagdad, had fallen into the\r\nsultan's power, now established on the Persian Gulf and in control of\r\nall of the ancient trade-routes to the East. The northern coasts of\r\nAfrica from Egypt to Algeria acknowledged the supremacy of Suleiman,\r\nwhose sea power in the Mediterranean had become a factor to be reckoned\r\nwith in European politics, threatening not only the islands but the\r\ngreat Christian countries of Italy and Spain. The Venetians were driven\r\nfrom the Morea and from the Ægean Islands; only Cyprus, Crete, and\r\nMalta survived in the Mediterranean as outposts of Christendom.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Suleiman the Magnificent]\r\n\r\nSuleiman devoted many years to the extension of his power in Europe,\r\nsometimes in alliance with the French king, sometimes upon his own\r\ninitiative,--and with almost unbroken success. In 1521 he declared war\r\nagainst the king of Hungary on the pretext that he had received no\r\nHungarian congratulations on his accession to the throne. He besieged\r\nand captured Belgrade, and in 1526 on the field of Mohács his forces\r\nmet and overwhelmed the Hungarians, whose king was killed with the\r\nflower of the Hungarian chivalry. The battle of Mohács marked the\r\nextinction of an independent and united Hungarian state; Ferdinand of\r\nHabsburg, brother of Charles V, claimed the kingdom; Suleiman was in\r\nactual possession of fully a third of it. The sultan's army carried the\r\nwar into Austria and in 1529 bombarded and invested Vienna, but so\r\nvaliant was the resistance offered that after three weeks the siege was\r\nabandoned. Twelve years later the greater part of Hungary, including\r\nthe city of Budapest, became a Turkish province, and in many places\r\nchurches were turned into mosques. In 1547 Charles V and Ferdinand were\r\ncompelled to recognize the Turkish conquests in Hungary, and the latter\r\nagreed to pay the sultan an annual tribute of 30,000 ducats. Suleiman\r\nnot only thwarted every attempt of his rivals to recover their\r\nterritories, but remained throughout his life a constant menace to the\r\nsecurity of the hereditary dominions of the Habsburgs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles V and the Holy Roman Empire.]\r\n[Sidenote: Possibility of transforming the Empire into a National\r\nGerman Monarchy]\r\n\r\nAt the very time when Charles V was encountering these grave troubles\r\nin administering his scattered hereditary possessions and in waging war\r\nnow with the French and now with the Mohammedans, he likewise was\r\nsaddled with problems peculiar to the government of his empire. Had he\r\nbeen able to devote all his talent and energy to the domestic affairs\r\nof the Holy Roman Empire, he might have contributed potently to the\r\nestablishment of a compact German state. It should be borne in mind\r\nthat when Charles V was elected emperor in 1519 the Holy Roman Empire\r\nwas virtually restricted to German-speaking peoples, and that the\r\nnational unifications of England, France, and Spain, already far\r\nadvanced, pointed the path to a similar political evolution for\r\nGermany. Why should not a modern German national state have been\r\ncreated coextensive with the medieval empire, a state which would have\r\nincluded not only the twentieth-century German Empire but Austria,\r\nHolland, and Belgium, and which, stretching from the Baltic to the\r\nAdriatic and from the English Channel to the Vistula, would have\r\ndominated the continent of Europe throughout the whole modern era?\r\nThere were certainly grave difficulties in the way, but grave\r\ndifficulties had also been encountered in consolidating France or\r\nSpain, and the difference was rather of degree than of kind. In every\r\nother case a strong monarch had overcome feudal princes and ambitious\r\nnobles, had deprived cities of many of their liberties, had trampled\r\nupon, or tampered with, the privileges of representative assemblies,\r\nand had enforced internal order and security. In every such case the\r\nmonarch had commanded the support of important popular elements and had\r\ndirected his major efforts to the realization of national aims.\r\n\r\nNational patriotism was not altogether lacking among Germans of the\r\nsixteenth century. They were conscious of a common language which was\r\nalready becoming a vehicle of literary expression. They were conscious\r\nof a common tradition and of a common nationality. They recognized, in\r\nmany cases, the absurdly antiquated character of their political\r\ninstitutions and ardently longed for reforms. In fact, the trouble with\r\nthe Germans was not so much the lack of thought about political reform\r\nas the actual conflicts between various groups concerning the method\r\nand goal of reform. Germans despised the Holy Roman Empire, much as\r\nFrenchmen abhorred the memory of feudal society; but Germans were not\r\nas unanimous as Frenchmen in advocating the establishment of a strong\r\nnational monarchy. In Germany were princes, free cities, and knights,--\r\nall nationalistic after a fashion, but all quarreling with each other\r\nand with their nominal sovereign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles V bent on Strengthening Monarchical Power though not\r\non a National Basis]\r\n\r\nThe emperors themselves were the only sincere and consistent champions\r\nof centralized monarchical power, but the emperors were probably less\r\npatriotic than any one else in the Holy Roman Empire. Charles V would\r\nnever abandon his pretensions to world power in order to become a\r\nstrong monarch over a single nation. Early in his reign he declared\r\nthat \"no monarchy was comparable though not to the Roman Empire. This\r\nthe whole world had once obeyed, and Christ Himself had paid it honor\r\nand obedience. Unfortunately it was now only a shadow of what it had\r\nbeen, but he hoped, with the help of those powerful countries and\r\nalliances which God had granted him, to raise it to its ancient glory.\"\r\nCharles V labored for an increase of personal power not only in Germany\r\nbut also in the Netherlands, in Spain, and in Italy; and with the vast\r\nimperial ambition of Charles the ideal of creating a national monarchy\r\non a strictly German basis was in sharp conflict. Charles V could not,\r\ncertainly would not, pose simply as a German king--a national leader.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nationalism among the German Princes]\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the powerful German princes, in defying the\r\nemperor's authority and in promoting disruptive tendencies in the Holy\r\nRoman Empire, were enabled to lay the blame at the feet of their\r\nunpatriotic sovereign and thereby arouse in their behalf a good deal of\r\nGerman national sentiment. In choosing Charles V to be their emperor,\r\nthe princely electors in 1519 had demanded that German or Latin should\r\nbe the official language of the Holy Roman Empire, that imperial\r\noffices should be open only to Germans, that the various princes should\r\nnot be subject to any foreign political jurisdiction, that no foreign\r\ntroops should serve in imperial wars without the approval of the Diet,\r\nand that Charles should confirm the sovereign rights of all the princes\r\nand appoint from their number a Council of Regency\r\n(_Reichsregiment_) to share in his government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Council of Regency, 1521-1531]\r\n[Sidenote: Its Failure to Unify Germany]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with an agreement reached by a Diet held at Worms in\r\n1521, the Council of Regency was created. Most of its twenty-three\r\nmembers were named by, and represented the interests of, the German\r\nprinces. Here might be the starting-point toward a closer political\r\nunion of the German-speaking people, if only a certain amount of\r\nfinancial independence could be secured to the Council. The proposal on\r\nthis score was a most promising one; it was to support the new imperial\r\nadministration, not, as formerly, by levying more or less voluntary\r\ncontributions on the various states, but by establishing a kind of\r\ncustoms-union (_Zollverein_) and imposing on foreign importations\r\na tariff for revenue. This time, however, the German burghers raised\r\nangry protests; the merchants and traders of the Hanseatic towns\r\ninsisted that the proposed financial burden would fall on them and\r\ndestroy their business; and their protests were potent enough to bring\r\nto nought the princes' plan. Thus the government was forced again to\r\nresort to the levy of special financial contributions,--an expedient\r\nwhich usually put the emperor and the Council of Regency at the mercy\r\nof the most selfish and least patriotic of the German princes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nationalism among the German Knights]\r\n\r\nMore truly patriotic as a class than German princes or German burghers\r\nwere the German knights--those gentlemen of the hill-top and of the\r\nroad, who, usually poor in pocket though stout of heart, looked down\r\nfrom their high-perched castles with badly disguised contempt upon the\r\nvulgar tradesmen of the town or beheld with anger and jealousy the\r\nencroachments of neighboring princes, lay and ecclesiastical, more\r\nwealthy and powerful than themselves. Especially against the princes\r\nthe knights contended, sometimes under the forms of law, more often by\r\nforce and violence and all the barbarous accompaniments of private\r\nwarfare and personal feud. Some of the knights were well educated and\r\nsome had literary and scholarly abilities; hardly any one of them was a\r\nfriend of public order. Yet practically all the knights were intensely\r\nproud of their German nationality. It was the knights, who, under the\r\nleadership of such fiery patriots as Ulrich von Hutten and Franz von\r\nSickingen, had forcefully contributed in 1519 to the imperial election\r\nof Charles V, a German Habsburg, in preference to non-German candidates\r\nsuch as Francis I of France or Henry VIII of England. For a brief\r\nperiod Charles V leaned heavily upon the German knights for support in\r\nhis struggle with princes and burghers; and at one time it looked as if\r\nthe knights in union with the emperor would succeed in curbing the\r\npower of the princes and in laying the foundations of a strongly\r\ncentralized national German monarchy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rise of Lutheranism Favored by the Knights and Opposed by\r\nCharles V]\r\n\r\nBut at the critical moment Protestantism arose in Germany, marking a\r\ncleavage between the knightly leaders and the emperor. To knights like\r\nUlrich von Hutten and Franz von Sickingen the final break in 1520\r\nbetween Martin Luther and the pope seemed to assure a separation of\r\nGermany from Italy and the erection of a peculiar form of German\r\nChristianity about which a truly national state could be builded. As a\r\nclass the knights applauded Luther and rejoiced at the rapid spread of\r\nhis teachings throughout Germany. On the other hand, Charles V remained\r\na Roman Catholic. Not only was he loyally attached to the religion of\r\nhis fathers through personal training and belief, but he felt that the\r\nmaintenance of what political authority he possessed was dependent\r\nlargely on the maintenance of the universal authority of the ancient\r\nChurch, and practically he needed papal assistance for his many foreign\r\nprojects. The same reasons that led many German princes to accept the\r\nLutheran doctrines as a means of lessening imperial control caused\r\nCharles V to reject them. At the same Diet at Worms (1521), at which\r\nthe Council of Regency had been created, Charles V prevailed upon the\r\nGermans present to condemn and outlaw Luther; and this action alienated\r\nthe knights from the emperor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Knights' War, 1522-1523]\r\n\r\nFranz von Sickingen, a Rhenish knight and the ablest of his class,\r\nspeedily took advantage of the emperor's absence from Germany in 1522\r\nto precipitate a Knights' War. In supreme command of a motley army of\r\nfellow-knights, Franz made an energetic attack upon the rich landed\r\nestates of the Catholic prince-bishop of Trier. At this point, the\r\nGerman princes, lay as well as ecclesiastical, forgetting their\r\nreligious predilections and mindful only of their common hatred of the\r\nknights, rushed to the defense of the bishop of Trier and drove off\r\nSickingen, who, in April, 1523, died fighting before his own castle of\r\nEbernburg. Ulrich von Hutten fled to Switzerland and perished miserably\r\nshortly afterwards. The knights' cause collapsed, and princes and\r\nburghers remained triumphant. [Footnote: The Knights' War was soon\r\nfollowed by the Peasants' Revolt, a social rather than a political\r\nmovement. For an account of the Peasants' Revolt see pp. 133 ff.] It\r\nwas the end of serious efforts in the sixteenth century to create a\r\nnational German state.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Failure of German Nationalism in the Sixteenth Century]\r\n\r\nThe Council of Regency lasted until 1531, though its inability to\r\npreserve domestic peace discredited it, and in its later years it\r\nenjoyed little authority. Left to themselves, many of the princes\r\nespoused Protestantism. In vain Charles V combated the new religious\r\nmovement. In vain he proscribed it in several Diets after that of\r\nWorms. In vain he assailed its upholders in several military campaigns,\r\nsuch as those against the Schmalkaldic League, which will be treated\r\nmore fully in another connection. But the long absences of Charles V\r\nfrom Germany and his absorption in a multitude of cares and worries, to\r\nsay nothing of the spasmodic aid which Francis, the Catholic king of\r\nFrance, gave to the Protestants in Germany, contributed indirectly to\r\nthe spread of Lutheranism. In the last year of Charles's rule (1555)\r\nthe profession of the Lutheran faith on the part of German princes was\r\nplaced by the peace of Augsburg [Footnote: See below, p. 136.] on an\r\nequal footing with that of the Catholic religion. Protestantism among\r\nthe German princes proved a disintegrating, rather than a unifying,\r\nfactor of national life. The rise of Protestantism was the last straw\r\nwhich broke German nationalism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles V and England]\r\n\r\nWith England the relations of Charles V were interesting but not so\r\nimportant as those already noted with the Germans, the Turks, and the\r\nFrench. At first in practical alliance with the impetuous self-willed\r\nHenry VIII (1509-1547), whose wife--Catherine of Aragon--was the\r\nemperor's aunt, Charles subsequently broke off friendly relations when\r\nthe English sovereign asked the pope to declare his marriage null and\r\nvoid. Charles prevailed upon the pope to deny Henry's request, and the\r\nschism which Henry then created between the Catholic Church in England\r\nand the Roman See increased the emperor's bitterness. Towards the close\r\nof Henry's reign relations improved again, but it was not until the\r\naccession of Charles's cousin, Mary (1553-1558), to the English throne\r\nthat really cordial friendship was restored. To this Queen Mary,\r\nCharles V married his son and successor Philip.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abdication of Charles V]\r\n\r\nAt length exhausted by his manifold labors, Charles V resolved to\r\ndivide his dominions between his brother Ferdinand and his son Philip\r\nand to retire from government. In the hall of the Golden Fleece at\r\nBrussels on 25 October, 1555, he formally abdicated the sovereignty of\r\nhis beloved Netherlands. Turning to the representatives, he said:\r\n\"Gentlemen, you must not be astonished if, old and feeble as I am in\r\nall my members, and also from the love I bear you, I shed some tears.\"\r\nAt least in the Netherlands the love was reciprocal. In 1556 he\r\nresigned the Spanish and Italian crowns, [Footnote: He made over to his\r\nbrother all his imperial authority, though he nominally retained the\r\ncrown of the Holy Roman Empire until 1558] and spent his last years in\r\npreparation for a future world. He died in 1558. Personally, Charles V\r\nhad a prominent lower jaw and a thin, pale face, relieved by a wide\r\nforehead and bright, flashing eyes. He was well formed and dignified in\r\nappearance. In character he was slow and at times both irresolute and\r\nobstinate, but he had a high sense of duty, honest intentions, good\r\nsoldierly qualities, and a large amount of cold common sense. Though\r\nnot highly educated, he was well read and genuinely appreciative of\r\nmusic and painting.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIP II AND THE PREDOMINANCE OF SPAIN\r\n\r\nFor a century and a half after the retirement of Charles V in 1556, we\r\nhear of two branches of the Habsburg family--the Spanish Habsburgs and\r\nthe Austrian Habsburgs, descended respectively from Philip II and\r\nFerdinand. By the terms of the division, Ferdinand, the brother of\r\nCharles, received the compact family possessions in the East--Austria\r\nand its dependencies, Bohemia, that portion of Hungary not occupied by\r\nthe Turks, and the title of Holy Roman Emperor,--while the remainder\r\nwent to Charles's son, Philip II,--Spain, the Netherlands, Franche\r\nComté (the eastern part of Burgundy), the Two Sicilies, Milan, and the\r\nAmerican colonies.\r\n\r\nOver the history of Ferdinand and his immediate successors, we need not\r\ntarry, because, aside from efforts to preserve religious peace and the\r\nfamily's political predominance within the empire and to recover\r\nHungary from the Turks, it is hardly essential. But in western Europe\r\nPhilip II for a variety of reasons became a figure of world-wide\r\nimportance: we must examine his career.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character and policies of Philip II]\r\n\r\nFew characters in history have elicited more widely contradictory\r\nestimates than Philip II. Represented by many Protestant writers as a\r\nvillain, despot, and bigot, he has been extolled by patriotic Spaniards\r\nas Philip the Great, champion of religion and right. These conflicting\r\nopinions are derived from different views which may be taken of the\r\nvalue and inherent worth of Philip's policies and methods, but what\r\nthose policies and methods were there can be no doubt. In the first\r\nplace, Philip II prized Spain as his native country and his main\r\npossession--in marked contrast to his father, for he himself had been\r\nborn in Spain and had resided there during almost all of his life--and\r\nhe was determined to make Spain the greatest country in the world. In\r\nthe second place, Philip II was sincerely and piously attached to\r\nCatholicism; he abhorred Protestantism as a blasphemous rending of the\r\nseamless garment of the Church; and he set his heart upon the universal\r\ntriumph of his faith. If, by any chance, a question should arise\r\nbetween the advantage of Spain and the best interests of the Church,\r\nthe former must be sacrificed relentlessly to the latter. Such was the\r\nsovereign's stern ideal. No seeming failure of his policies could shake\r\nhis belief in their fundamental excellence. That whatever he did was\r\ndone for the greater glory of God, that success or failure depended\r\nupon the inscrutable will of the Almighty and not upon himself, were\r\nhis guiding convictions, which he transmitted to his Spanish\r\nsuccessors. Not only was Philip a man of principles and ideals, but he\r\nwas possessed of a boundless capacity for work and an indomitable will.\r\nHe preferred tact and diplomacy to war and prowess of arms, though he\r\nwas quite willing to order his troops to battle if the object, in his\r\nopinion, was right. He was personally less accustomed to the sword than\r\nto the pen, and no clerk ever toiled more industriously at his papers\r\nthan did this king. From early morning until far into the night he bent\r\nover minutes and reports and other business of kingcraft. Naturally\r\ncautious and reserved, he was dignified and princely in public. In his\r\nprivate life, he was orderly and extremely affectionate to his family\r\nand servants. Loyalty was Philip's best attribute.\r\n\r\nThere was a less happy side to the character of Philip II. His free use\r\nof the Inquisition in order to extirpate heresy throughout his\r\ndominions has rendered him in modern eyes an embodiment of bigotry and\r\nintolerance, but it must be remembered that he lived in an essentially\r\nintolerant age, when religious persecution was stock in trade of\r\nProtestants no less than of Catholics. It is likewise true that he\r\nconstantly employed craft and deceit and was ready to make use of\r\nassassination for political purposes, but this too was in accordance\r\nwith the temper of the times: lawyers then taught, following the\r\nprecepts of the famous historian and political philosopher,\r\nMachiavelli, that Christian morality is a guide for private conduct\r\nrather than for public business, and that \"the Prince\" may act above\r\nthe laws in order to promote the public good, and even such famous\r\nProtestant leaders as Coligny and William the Silent entered into\r\nmurder plots. But when all due allowances have been made, the student\r\ncannot help feeling that the purpose of Philip II would have been\r\nserved better by the employment of means other than persecution and\r\nmurder.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Philip II covered approximately the second half of the\r\nsixteenth century (1556-1598). In his efforts to make Spain the\r\ngreatest power in the world and to restore the unity problems of\r\nChristendom, he was doomed to failure. The chief Confronting reason for\r\nthe failure is simple--the number and [side note Problems Confronting\r\nPhilip II] variety of the problems and projects with which Philip II\r\nwas concerned. It was a case of the king putting a finger in too many\r\npies--he was cruelly burned. Could Philip II have devoted all his\r\nenergies to one thing at a time, he might conceivably have had greater\r\nsuccess, but as it was, he must divide his attention between\r\nsupervising the complex administration of his already wide dominions\r\nand annexing in addition the monarchy and empire of Portugal, between\r\npromoting a vigorous commercial and colonial policy and suppressing a\r\nstubborn revolt in the Netherlands, between championing Catholicism in\r\nboth England and France and protecting Christendom against the\r\nvictorious Mohammedans. It was this multiplicity of interests that\r\nparalyzed the might of the Spanish monarch, yet each one of his foreign\r\nactivities was epochal in the history of the country affected. We shall\r\ntherefore briefly review Philip's activities in order.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spain under Philip II: Political]\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, Philip II inherited a number of states which had\r\nseparate political institutions and customs. He believed in national\r\nunification, at least of Spain. National unification implied\r\nuniformity, and uniformity implied greater power of the crown. So\r\nPhilip sought to further the work of his great-grandparents, Ferdinand\r\nand Isabella,--absolutism and uniformity became his watchwords in\r\ninternal administration. Politically Philip made no pretense of\r\nconsulting the Cortes on legislation, and, although he convoked them to\r\nvote new taxes, he established the rule that the old taxes were to be\r\nconsidered as granted in perpetuity and as constituting the ordinary\r\nrevenue of the crown. He treated the nobles as ornamental rather than\r\nuseful, retiring them from royal offices in favor of lawyers and other\r\nsubservient members of the middle class. All business was conducted by\r\ncorrespondence and with a final reference to the king, and the natural\r\nresult was endless delay.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spain under Philip II: Economic]\r\n\r\nFinancially and economically the period was unfortunate for Spain. The\r\nburden of the host of foreign enterprises fell with crushing weight\r\nupon the Spanish kingdom and particularly upon Castile. Aragon, which\r\nwas poor and jealous of its own rights, would give little. The income\r\nfrom the Netherlands, at first large, was stopped by the revolt. The\r\nItalian states barely paid expenses. The revenue from the American\r\nmines, which has been greatly exaggerated, enriched the pockets of\r\nindividuals rather than the treasury of the state. In Spain itself, the\r\ngreater part of the land was owned by the ecclesiastical corporations\r\nand the nobles, who were exempt from taxation but were intermittently\r\nfleeced. Moreover, the 10 per cent tax on all sales--the alcabala\r\n[Footnote: See above, p. 57.]--gradually paralyzed all native\r\nindustrial enterprise. And the persecution of wealthy and industrious\r\nJews and Moors diminished the resources of the kingdom. Spain, at the\r\nclose of the century, was on the verge of bankruptcy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spain under Philip II: Religious]\r\n\r\nIn religious matters Philip II aimed at uniform adherence to the\r\ndoctrines of the Roman Catholic Church. He felt, like so many of his\r\ncontemporaries, that disparity of belief  among subjects would imperil\r\na state. Both from political motives and from religious zeal Philip was\r\na Catholic. He therefore advised the pope, watched with interest the\r\nproceedings of the great Council of Trent which was engaged with the\r\nreformation of the Church, [Footnote: See below, pp. 158 ff.] and\r\nlabored for the triumph of his religion not only in his own dominions\r\nand in France, but also in Poland, in England, and even in Scandinavia.\r\nIn Spain he strengthened the Inquisition and used it as a tool of royal\r\ndespotism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Temporary Union of Spain and Portugal]\r\n\r\nTerritorially Philip II desired to complete political unity in the\r\npeninsula by combining the crown of Portugal with those of Castile and\r\nAragon. He himself was closely related to the Portuguese royal family,\r\nand in 1580 he laid formal claim to that kingdom. The duke of Braganza,\r\nwhose claim was better than Philip's, was bought off by immense grants\r\nand the country was overrun by Spanish troops. Philip endeavored to\r\nplacate the Portuguese by full recognition of their constitutional\r\nrights and in particular by favoring the lesser nobility or country\r\ngentry. Although the monarchies and vast colonial possessions of Spain\r\nand Portugal were thus joined for sixty years under a common king, the\r\narrangement never commanded any affection in Portugal, with the result\r\nthat at the first opportunity, in 1640, Portuguese independence was\r\nrestored under the leadership of the Braganza family.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rebellions Against Philip II in Spain]\r\n\r\nThe most serious domestic difficulty which Philip had to face was the\r\nrevolt of the rich and populous Netherlands, which we shall discuss\r\npresently. But with other revolts the king had to contend. In his\r\nefforts to stamp out heresy and peculiar customs among the descendants\r\nof the Moors who still lived in the southern part of Spain, Philip\r\naroused armed opposition. The Moriscos, as they were called, struggled\r\ndesperately from 1568 to 1570 to reëstablish the independence of\r\nGranada. This rebellion was suppressed with great cruelty, and the\r\nsurviving Moriscos were forced to find new homes in less favored parts\r\nof Spain until their final expulsion from the country in 1609. A revolt\r\nof Aragon in 1591 was put down by a Castilian army; the constitutional\r\nrights of Aragon were diminished and the kingdom was reduced to a\r\ngreater measure of submission.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolt of the Netherlands: The Causes]\r\n\r\nThe causes that led to the revolt of the Netherlands may be stated as\r\nfourfold. (1) Financial. The burdensome taxes which Charles V had laid\r\nupon the country were increased by Philip II and often applied to\r\ndefray the expenses of other parts of the Spanish possessions.\r\nFurthermore, the restrictions which Philip imposed upon Dutch commerce\r\nin the interest of that of Spain threatened to interfere seriously with\r\nthe wonted economic prosperity of the Netherlands. (2) Political.\r\nPhilip II sought to centralize authority in the Netherlands and\r\ndespotically deprived the cities and nobles of many of their\r\ntraditional privileges. Philip never visited the country in person\r\nafter 1559, and he intrusted his arbitrary government to regents and to\r\nSpaniards rather than to native leaders. The scions of the old and\r\nproud noble families of the Netherlands naturally resented being\r\nsupplanted in lucrative and honorable public offices by persons whom\r\nthey could regard only as upstarts. (3) Religious. Despite the rapid\r\nand universal spread of Calvinistic Protestantism throughout the\r\nnorthern provinces, Philip was resolved to force Catholicism upon all\r\nof his subjects. He increased the number of bishoprics, decreed acts of\r\nuniformity, and in a vigorous way utilized the Inquisition to carry his\r\npolicy into effect. (4) Personal. The Dutch and Flemish loved Charles V\r\nbecause he had been born and reared among them and always considered\r\ntheir country as his native land. Philip II was born and brought up in\r\nSpain. He spoke a language foreign to the Netherlands, and by their\r\ninhabitants he was thought of as an alien.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Margaret of Parma and the \"Beggars\"]\r\n\r\nAt first the opposition in the Netherlands was directed chiefly against\r\nthe Inquisition and the presence of Spanish garrisons in the towns. The\r\nregent, Margaret of Parma, Philip's half-sister, endeavored to banish\r\npublic discontent by a few concessions. The Spanish troops were\r\nwithdrawn and certain unpopular officials were dismissed. But\r\ninfluential noblemen and burghers banded themselves together early in\r\n1566 and presented to the regent Margaret a petition, in which, while\r\nprotesting their loyalty, they expressed fear of a general revolt and\r\nbegged that a special embassy be sent to Philip to urge upon him the\r\nnecessity of abolishing the Inquisition and of redressing their other\r\ngrievances. The regent, at first disquieted by the petitioners, was\r\nreassured by one of her advisers, who exclaimed, \"What, Madam, is your\r\nHighness afraid of these beggars (_ces gueux_)?\" Henceforth the\r\nchief opponents of Philip's policies in the Netherlands humorously\r\nlabeled themselves \"Beggars\" and assumed the emblems of common begging,\r\nthe wallet and the bowl. The fashion spread quickly, and the \"Beggars'\"\r\ninsignia were everywhere to be seen, worn as trinkets, especially in\r\nthe large towns. In accordance with the \"Beggars'\" petition, an embassy\r\nwas dispatched to Spain to lay the grievances before Philip II.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Duke of Alva in the Netherlands, 1567-1573]\r\n\r\nPhilip II at first promised to abolish the Inquisition in the\r\nNetherlands, but soon repented of his promise. For meanwhile mobs of\r\nfanatical Protestants, far more radical than the respectable \"Beggars,\"\r\nwere rushing to arms, breaking into Catholic churches, wrecking the\r\naltars, smashing the images to pieces, profaning monasteries, and\r\nshowing in their retaliation as much violence--as their enemies had\r\nshown cruelty in persecution. In August, 1566, this sacrilegious\r\niconoclasm reached its climax in the irreparable ruin of the\r\nmagnificent cathedral at Antwerp. Philip replied to these acts, which\r\nhe interpreted as disloyalty, by sending (1567) his most famous\r\ngeneral, the duke of Alva, into the Netherlands with a large army and\r\nwith instructions to cow the people into submission. Alva proved\r\nhimself quite capable of understanding and executing his master's\r\nwishes: one of his first acts was the creation of a \"Council of\r\nTroubles,\" an arbitrary tribunal which tried cases of treason and which\r\noperated so notoriously as to merit its popular appellation of the\r\n\"Council of Blood.\" During the duke's stay of six years, it has been\r\nestimated that eight thousand persons were executed, including the\r\ncounts of Egmont and Horn, thirty thousand were despoiled of their\r\nproperty, and one hundred thousand quitted the country. Alva, moreover,\r\nlevied an enormous tax of one-tenth upon the price of merchandise sold.\r\nAs the tax was collected on several distinct processes, it absorbed at\r\nleast seven-tenths of the value of certain goods--of cloth, for\r\ninstance. The tax, together with the lawless confusion throughout the\r\ncountry, meant the destruction of Flemish manufactures and trade. It\r\nwas, therefore, quite natural that the burgesses of the southern\r\nNetherlands, Catholic though most of them were, should unite with the\r\nnobles and with the Protestants of the North in opposing Spanish\r\ntyranny. The whole country was now called to arms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: William the Silent, Prince of Orange]\r\n\r\nOne of the principal noblemen of the Netherlands was a German, William\r\nof Nassau, prince of Orange.[Footnote: William (1533-1584), now\r\ncommonly called \"the Silent.\" There appears to be no contemporaneous\r\njustification of the adjective as applied to him, but the misnomer,\r\nonce adopted by later writers, has insistently clung to him.] He had\r\nbeen governing the provinces of Holland and Zeeland when Alva arrived,\r\nbut as he was already at the point of accepting Protestantism he had\r\nprudently retired into Germany, leaving his estates to be confiscated\r\nby the Spanish governor. Certain trifling successes of the insurgents\r\nnow called William back to head the popular movement. For many years he\r\nbore the brunt of the war and proved himself not only a resourceful\r\ngeneral, but an able diplomat and a whole-souled patriot. He eventually\r\ngained the admiration and love of the whole Dutch people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Sea Beggars\"]\r\n\r\nThe first armed forces of William of Orange were easily routed by Alva,\r\nbut in 1569 a far more menacing situation was presented. In that year\r\nWilliam began to charter corsairs and privateers to prey upon Spanish\r\nshipping. These \"Sea Beggars,\" as they were called, were mostly wild\r\nand lawless desperadoes who stopped at nothing in their hatred of\r\nCatholics and Spaniards: they early laid the foundations of Dutch\r\nmaritime power and at the same time proved a constant torment to Alva.\r\nThey made frequent incursions into the numerous waterways of the\r\nNetherlands and perpetually fanned the embers of revolt on land.\r\nGradually William collected new armies, which more and more\r\nsuccessfully defied Alva.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Spanish Fury\" and the Pacification of Ghent, 1576]\r\n\r\nThe harsh tactics of Alva had failed to restore the Netherlands to\r\nPhilip's control, and in 1573 Alva was replaced in the regency by the\r\nmore politic Requesens, who continued the struggle as best he could but\r\nwith even less success than Alva. Soon after Requesens's death in 1576,\r\nthe Spanish army in the Netherlands, left without pay or food, mutinied\r\nand inflicted such horrible indignities upon several cities, notably\r\nAntwerp, that the savage attack is called the \"Spanish Fury.\" Deputies\r\nof all the seventeen provinces at once concluded an agreement, termed\r\nthe Pacification of Ghent (1576), by which they mutually guaranteed\r\nresistance to the Spanish until the king should abolish the Inquisition\r\nand restore their old-time liberties.\r\n\r\nThen Philip II tried a policy of concession, but the new governor, the\r\ndashing Don John of Austria, fresh from a great naval victory over the\r\nTurks, soon discovered that it was too late to reconcile the\r\nProtestants. William the Silent was wary of the Spanish offers, and Don\r\nJohn died in 1578 without having achieved very much.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Farnese, Duke of Parma]\r\n[Sidenote: The Treaty of Array and the Union of Utrecht (1579): the\r\nPermanent Division of the Netherlands]\r\n\r\nBut Philip II was not without some success in the Netherlands. He was\r\nfortunate in having a particularly determined and tactful governor in\r\nthe country from 1578 to 1592 in the person of Alexander Farnese, duke\r\nof Parma. Skillfully mingling war and diplomacy, Farnese succeeded in\r\nsowing discord between the northern and southern provinces: the former\r\nwere Dutch, Calvinist, and commercial; the latter were Flemish and\r\nWalloon, Catholic, and industrial. The ten southern provinces might\r\neventually have more to fear from the North than from continued union\r\nwith Spain; their representatives, therefore, signed a defensive league\r\nat Arras in 1579 for the protection of the Catholic religion and with\r\nthe avowed purpose of effecting a reconciliation with Philip II. In the\r\nsame year the northern provinces agreed to the Union of Utrecht,\r\nbinding themselves together \"as if they were one province\" to maintain\r\ntheir rights and liberties \"with life-blood and goods\" against Spanish\r\ntyranny and to grant complete freedom of worship and of religious\r\nopinion throughout the confederation. In this way the Pacification of\r\nGhent was nullified and the Netherlands were split into two parts, each\r\ngoing its own way, each developing its own history. The southern\r\nportion was to remain in Habsburg hands for over two centuries, being\r\nsuccessively termed \"Spanish Netherlands\" and \"Austrian Netherlands\"--\r\nroughly speaking, it is what to-day we call Belgium. The northern\r\nportion was to become free and independent, and, as the \"United\r\nProvinces\" or simply \"Holland,\" to take its place among the nations of\r\nthe world. For a considerable period of time Holland was destined to be\r\nmore prosperous than Belgium. The latter suffered more grievously than\r\nthe former from the actual hostilities; and the Dutch, by closing the\r\nRiver Scheldt and dominating the adjacent seas, dealt a mortal blow at\r\nthe industrial and commercial supremacy of Antwerp and transferred the\r\nchief trade and business of all the Netherlands to their own city of\r\nAmsterdam.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reasons for the Success of the Dutch]\r\n\r\nFor many years the struggle dragged on. At times it seemed probable\r\nthat Farnese and the Spaniards would overcome the North by force as\r\nthey had obtained the South by diplomacy. But a variety of reasons\r\nexplain the ultimate success of the Dutch. The nature of the country\r\nrendered ordinary campaigning very difficult--the network of canals\r\nconstituted natural lines of defense and the cutting of the dikes might\r\neasily imperil an invading army. Again, the seafaring propensities of\r\nthe Dutch stimulated them to fit out an increasing number of privateers\r\nwhich constantly preyed upon Spanish commerce: it was not long before\r\nthis traffic grew important and legitimate, so that in the following\r\ncentury Amsterdam became one of the greatest cities of the world, and\r\nHolland assumed a prominent place among commercial and colonial\r\nnations. Thirdly, the employment of foreign mercenaries in the army of\r\ndefense enabled the native population to devote the more time to\r\npeaceful pursuits, and, despite the persistence of war, the Dutch\r\nprovinces increased steadily in wealth and prosperity. Fourthly, the\r\ncautious Fabian policy of William the Silent prevented the Dutch from\r\nstaking heavily upon battles in the open field. Fifthly, the Dutch\r\nreceived a good deal of assistance from Protestants of Germany,\r\nEngland, and France. Finally, Philip II pursued too many great projects\r\nat once to be able to bring a single one to a satisfactory conclusion:\r\nhis war with Queen Elizabeth of England and his interference in the\r\naffairs of France inextricably complicated his plans in the\r\nNetherlands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Formal Declaration of Dutch Independence, 1581]\r\n\r\nIn 1581 Philip II published a ban against William of Orange,\r\nproclaiming him a traitor and an outlaw and offering a reward to any\r\none who would take him dead or alive. William replied by his famous\r\n\"Apology\" to the charges against him; but his practical answer to the\r\nking was the Act of Abjuration, by which at his persuasion the\r\nrepresentatives of the northern provinces, assembled at The Hague,\r\nsolemnly proclaimed their separation from the crown of Spain, broke the\r\nroyal seal of Philip II, and declared the king deprived of all\r\nauthority over them. We should call this Act of 1581 the Dutch\r\ndeclaration of independence. It was an augury of the definitive result\r\nof the war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Recognition of Dutch Independence]\r\n\r\nAlthough William the Silent was assassinated by an agent of Spain\r\n(1584), and Antwerp was captured from the Protestants in 1585, the\r\nability and genius of Farnese did not avail to make further headway\r\nagainst the United Provinces; but Philip II, stubborn to the end,\r\npositively refused to recognize Dutch independence. In 1609 Philip III\r\nof Spain consented to a twelve years' truce with the States-General of\r\nThe Hague. In the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) the Dutch and Spaniards\r\nagain became embroiled, and the freedom of the republic was not\r\nrecognized officially by Spain till the general peace of Westphalia in\r\n1648. [Footnote: See below, p. 229.]\r\n\r\nThe seven provinces, which had waged such long war with Spain,\r\nconstituted, by mutual agreement, a confederacy, each preserving a\r\ndistinct local government and administration, but all subject to a\r\ngeneral parliament--the States-General--and to a stadtholder, or\r\ngovernor-general, an office which subsequently became hereditary in the\r\nOrange family. Between the States-General and the stadtholder, a\r\nconstitutional conflict was carried on throughout the greater part of\r\nthe seventeenth century--the former, supported by well-to-do burghers,\r\nfavoring a greater measure of political democracy, the latter, upheld\r\nby aristocratically minded nobles, laboring for the development of\r\nmonarchical institutions under the Orange family.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Natural Opposition of England and France to the Policies of\r\nPhilip II]\r\n\r\nNot only his efforts in the Netherlands but many other projects of\r\nPhilip II were frustrated by remarkable parallel developments in the\r\ntwo national monarchies of England and France. Both these countries\r\nwere naturally jealous opposition and fearful of an undue expansion of\r\nSpain, which might upset the balance of power. Both states, from their\r\ngeographical locations, would normally be inimical to Philip II:\r\nEngland would desire, from her island position, to destroy the monopoly\r\nwhich Spain claimed of the carrying trade of the seas; France, still\r\nencircled by Habsburg possessions in Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands,\r\nwould adhere to her traditional policy of allying herself with every\r\nfoe of the Spanish king. Then, too, the papal authority had been\r\nrejected in England and seriously questioned in France: Philip's\r\ncrusading zeal made him the champion of the Church in those countries.\r\nFor ecclesiastical as well as for economic and political purposes it\r\nseemed necessary to the Spanish king that he should bring France and\r\nEngland under his direct influence. On their side, patriotic French and\r\nEnglish resented such foreign interest in their domestic affairs, and\r\nthe eventual failure of Philip registered a wonderful growth of\r\nnational feeling among the peoples who victoriously contended against\r\nhim. The beginnings of the real modern greatness of France and England\r\ndate from their struggle with Philip II.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip II and Mary Tudor]\r\n\r\nAt the outset of his reign, Philip seemed quite successful in his\r\nforeign relations. As we have seen, he was in alliance with England\r\nthrough his marriage with Queen Mary Tudor (1553-1558): she had\r\ntemporarily restored the English Church to communion with the Holy See,\r\nand was conducting her foreign policy in harmony with Philip's--because\r\nof her husband she lost to the French the town of Calais, the last\r\nEnglish possession on the Continent (1558). Likewise, as has been said,\r\nPhilip II concluded with France in 1559 the advantageous treaty of\r\nCateau-Cambrésis. But during the ensuing thirty years the tables were\r\ncompletely turned. Both England and France ended by securing respite\r\nfrom Spanish interference.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip II and Elizabeth]\r\n\r\nMary Tudor died unhappy and childless in 1558, and the succession of\r\nher sister Queen Elizabeth, daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn,\r\naltered the relations between the English and Spanish courts. Elizabeth\r\n(1558-1603) was possessed of an imperious, haughty, energetic\r\ncharacter; she had remarkable intelligence and an absorbing patriotism.\r\nShe inspired confidence in her advisers and respect among her people,\r\nso that she was commonly called \"Good Queen Bess\" despite the fact that\r\nher habits of deceit and double-dealing gave color to the French king's\r\nremark that she was the greatest liar in Christendom. This was the\r\nwoman with whom Philip II had to deal; he tried many tactics in order\r\nto gain his ends,--all of them hopelessly unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nPhilip first proposed matrimony, but Elizabeth was very careful not to\r\ngive herself, or England, such a master. Then when the queen declared\r\nherself a Protestant and showed no inclination to assist Philip in any\r\nof his enterprises, the Spanish king proceeded to plot against her\r\nthrone. He subsidized Roman Catholic priests, especially Jesuits, who\r\nviolated the laws of the land. He stirred up sedition and even went so\r\nfar as to plan Elizabeth's assassination. Many conspiracies against the\r\nEnglish queen centered in the person of the ill-starred Mary Stuart,\r\n[Footnote: Mary Stuart (1542-1587).] queen of Scotland, who was\r\nnext in line of succession to the English throne and withal a Catholic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mary Stuart]\r\n\r\nDescended from the Stuart kings of Scotland and from Henry VII of\r\nEngland, related to the powerful family of Guise in France, Mary had\r\nbeen brought up at the French court and married to the short-lived\r\nFrench king, Francis II. Upon the death of the latter she returned in\r\n1561 to Scotland, a young woman of but eighteen years, only to find\r\nthat the government had fallen victim to the prevalent factional fights\r\namong the Scotch nobles and that in the preceding year the parliament\r\nhad solemnly adopted a Calvinistic form of Protestantism. By means of\r\ntact and mildness, however, Mary won the respect of the nobles and the\r\nadmiration of the people, until a series of marital troubles and\r\nblunders--her marriage with a worthless cousin, Henry Darnley, and then\r\nher scandalous marriage with Darnley's profligate murderer, the earl of\r\nBothwell--alienated her people from her and drove her into exile. She\r\nabdicated the throne of Scotland in favor of her infant son, James VI,\r\nwho was reared a Protestant and subsequently became King James I of\r\nEngland, and she then (1568) threw herself upon the mercy of Elizabeth.\r\nShe thought she would find in England a haven of refuge; instead she\r\nfound there a prison.\r\n\r\nFor the score of years during which she remained Elizabeth's prisoner,\r\nMary Stuart was the object of many plots and conspiracies against the\r\nexisting governments of both Scotland and England. In every such scheme\r\nwere to be found the machinations and money of the Spanish king. In\r\nfact, as time went on, it seemed to a growing section of the English\r\npeople as though the cause of Elizabeth was bound up with Protestantism\r\nand with national independence and prosperity just as certainly as the\r\nsuccess of Mary would lead to the triumph of Catholicism, the political\r\nsupremacy of Spain, and the commercial ruin of England. It was under\r\nthese circumstances that Mary's fate was sealed. Because of a political\r\nsituation over which she had slight control, the ex-queen of Scotland\r\nwas beheaded by Elizabeth's orders in 1587.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Armada]\r\n\r\nPhilip II had now tried and failed in every expedient but one,--the\r\nemployment of sheer force. Even this he attempted in order to avenge\r\nthe death of Mary Stuart and to bring England, politically,\r\nreligiously, and commercially, into harmony with his Spanish policies.\r\nThe story of the preparation and the fate of the Invincible Armada is\r\nalmost too well known to require repetition. It was in 1588 that there\r\nissued from the mouth of the Tagus River the most formidable fleet\r\nwhich up to that time Christendom had ever beheld--130 ships, 8000\r\nseamen, 19,000 soldiers, the flower of the Spanish chivalry. In the\r\nNetherlands it was to be joined by Alexander Farnese with 33,000\r\nveteran troops. But in one important respect Philip had underestimated\r\nhis enemy: he had counted upon a divided country. Now the attack upon\r\nEngland was primarily national, rather than religious, and Catholics\r\nvied with Protestants in offering aid to the queen: it was a united\r\nrather than a divided nation which Philip faced. The English fleet,\r\ncomposed of comparatively small and easily maneuvered vessels, worked\r\ngreat havoc upon the ponderous and slow-moving Spanish galleons, and\r\nthe wreck of the Armada was completed by a furious gale which tossed\r\nship after ship upon the rocks of northern Scotland. Less than a third\r\nof the original expedition ever returned to Spain.\r\n\r\nPhilip II had thus failed in his herculean effort against England. He\r\ncontinued in small ways to annoy and to irritate Elizabeth. He tried--\r\nwithout result--to incite the Catholics of Ireland against the queen.\r\nHe exhausted his arsenals and his treasures in despairing attempts to\r\nequip a second and even a third Armada. But he was doomed to bitterest\r\ndisappointment, for two years before his death an English fleet sacked\r\nhis own great port of Cadiz. The war with England ruined the navy and\r\nthe commerce of Spain. The defeat of the Armada was England's first\r\ntitle to commercial supremacy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Economic Benefits of the Period for England]\r\n\r\nIt was long maintained that the underlying causes of the conflict\r\nbetween England and Spain in the second half of the sixteenth century\r\nand its chief interest was religious--that it was part of an epic\r\nstruggle between Protestantism and Catholicism. There may be a measure\r\nof truth in such an idea, but most recent writers believe that the\r\nchief motives for the conflict, as well as its important results, were\r\nessentially economic. From the beginning of Elizabeth's reign, English\r\nsailors and freebooters, such as Hawkins and Drake, took the offensive\r\nagainst Spanish trade and commerce; and many ships, laden with silver\r\nand goods from the New World and bound for Cadiz, were seized and towed\r\ninto English harbors. The queen herself frequently received a share of\r\nthe booty and therefore tended to encourage the practice. For nearly\r\nthirty years Philip put up with the capture of his treasure ships, the\r\nraiding of his colonies, and the open assistance rendered to his\r\nrebellious subjects. Only when he reached the conclusion that his power\r\nwould never be secure in the Netherlands or in America did he dispatch\r\nthe Armada. Its failure finally freed Holland and marked the collapse\r\nof the Spanish monopoly upon the high seas and in the New World.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Affairs in France]\r\n\r\nBefore we can appreciate the motives and results of the interference of\r\nPhilip II in French affairs, a few words must be said about what had\r\nhappened in France since Francis I (1515-1547) and his son, Henry II\r\n(1547-1559), exalted the royal power in their country and not only\r\npreserved French independence of the surrounding empire of Charles V\r\nbut also increased French prestige by means of a strong policy in Italy\r\nand by the extension of frontiers toward the Rhine. Henry II had\r\nmarried a member of the famous Florentine family of the Medici--\r\nCatherine de' Medici--a large and ugly woman, but ambitious,\r\nresourceful, and capable, who, by means of trickery and deceit, took an\r\nactive part in French politics from the death of her husband,\r\nthroughout the reigns of her feeble sons, Francis II (1559-1560),\r\nCharles IX (1560-1574), and Henry III (1574-1589). Catherine found her\r\nposition and that of her royal children continually threatened by (1)\r\nthe Protestants (Huguenots), (2) the great nobles, and (3) Philip II of\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dangers to Royal Power in France: Protestantism]\r\n\r\nFrench Protestantism had grown steadily during the first half of the\r\nsixteenth century until it was estimated that from a twentieth to a\r\nthirtieth of the nation had fallen away from the Catholic Church. The\r\ninfluence of the advocates of the new faith was, however, much greater\r\nthan their number, because the Huguenots, as they were called, were\r\nrecruited mainly from the prosperous, intelligent middle class,--the\r\nbourgeoisie,--who had been intrusted by preceding French kings with\r\nmany important offices. The Huguenots represented, therefore, a\r\npowerful social class and likewise one that was opposed to the undue\r\nincrease of royal power. They demanded, not only religious toleration\r\nfor themselves, but also regular meetings of the Estates-General and\r\ncontrol of the nation's representatives over financial matters. The\r\nkings, on their part, felt that political solidarity and their own\r\npersonal rule were dependent upon the maintenance of religious\r\nuniformity in the nation and the consequent defeat of the pretensions\r\nof the Huguenots. Francis I and Henry II had persecuted the Protestants\r\nwith bitterness. From 1562 to 1593 a series of so-called religious wars\r\nembroiled the whole country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dangers to Royal Power in France: the Nobles]\r\n\r\nFrench politics were further complicated during the second half of the\r\nsixteenth century by the recrudescence of the power of the nobles. The\r\nso-called religious wars were quite as much political as religious--\r\nthey resulted from efforts of this or that faction of noblemen to\r\ndictate to a weak king. Two noble families particularly vied with each\r\nother for power,--the Bourbons and the Guises,--and the unqualified\r\ntriumph of either would be certain to bring calamity to the sons of\r\nCatherine de' Medici.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Bourbons]\r\n\r\nThe Bourbons bore the proud title of princes of the blood because they\r\nwere direct descendants of a French king. Their descent, to be sure,\r\nwas from Saint Louis, king in the thirteenth century, and they were\r\nnow, therefore, only distant cousins of the reigning kings, but as the\r\nlatter died off, one after another, leaving no direct successors, the\r\nBourbons by the French law of strict male succession became heirs to\r\nthe royal family. The head of the Bourbons, a certain Anthony, had\r\nmarried the queen of Navarre and had become thereby king of Navarre,\r\nalthough the greater part of that country--the region south of the\r\nPyrenees--had been annexed to Spain in 1512. Anthony's brother Louis,\r\nprince of Condé, had a reputation for bravery, loyalty, and ability.\r\nBoth Condé and the king of Navarre were Protestants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Guise Family]\r\n\r\nThe Guise family was descended from a duke of Lorraine who had attached\r\nhimself to the court of Francis I. It was really a foreign family,\r\ninasmuch as Lorraine was then a dependency of the Holy Roman Empire,\r\nbut the patriotic exploits of the head of the family in defending Metz\r\nagainst the Emperor Charles V and in capturing Calais from the English\r\nendeared the Guises to a goodly part of the French nation. The duke of\r\nGuise remained a stanch Catholic, and his brother, called the Cardinal\r\nof Lorraine, was head of as many as twelve bishoprics, which gave him\r\nan enormous revenue and made him the most conspicuous churchman in\r\nFrance. During the reign of Henry II (1547-1559) the Guises were\r\nespecially influential. They fought valiantly in foreign wars. They\r\nspurred on the king to a great persecution of the Huguenots. They\r\nincreased their own landed estates. And they married one of their\r\nrelatives--Mary, queen of Scots--to the heir to the throne. But after\r\nthe brief reign of Mary's husband, Francis II (1559-1560), the Guise\r\nfamily encountered not only the active opposition of their chief noble\r\nrivals, the Bourbons, with their Huguenot allies, but likewise the\r\njealousy and crafty intrigues of Catherine de' Medici.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Religious Wars in France]\r\n\r\nCatherine feared both the ambition of the powerful Guise family and the\r\ndisruptive tendencies of Protestantism. The result was a long series of\r\nconfused civil wars between  the ardent followers, respectively\r\nCatholic and Protestant, of the Guise and Bourbon families, in which\r\nthe queen-mother gave support first to one side and then to the other.\r\nThere were no fewer than eight of these sanguinary conflicts, each one\r\nending with the grant of slight concessions to the Huguenots and the\r\nmaintenance of the weak kings upon the throne. The massacre of Saint\r\nBartholomew's Day (1572) was a horrible incident of Catherine's policy\r\nof \"trimming.\" Fearing the undue influence over the king of Admiral de\r\nColigny, an upright and able Huguenot leader, the queen-mother, with\r\nthe aid of the Guises, prevailed upon the weak-minded Charles IX to\r\nauthorize the wholesale assassination of Protestants. The signal was\r\ngiven by the ringing of a Parisian church-bell at two o'clock in the\r\nmorning of 24 August, 1572, and the slaughter went on throughout the\r\nday in the capital and for several weeks in the provinces. Coligny was\r\nmurdered; even women and children were not spared. It is estimated that\r\nin all at least three thousand--perhaps ten thousand--lost their lives.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Politiques\"]\r\n\r\nThe massacre of Saint Bartholomew's Day did not destroy French\r\nProtestantism or render the Huguenot leaders more timid in\r\nasserting their claims. On the other hand, it brought into\r\nclear light a noteworthy division within the ranks of their Catholic\r\nopponents in France--on one side, the rigorous followers of the Guise\r\nfamily, who complained only that the massacre had not been sufficiently\r\ncomprehensive, and, on the other side, a group of moderate Catholics,\r\nusually styled the \"Politiques\" who, while continuing to adhere to the\r\nRoman Church, and, when called upon, bearing arms on the side of the\r\nking, were strongly opposed to the employment of force or violence or\r\npersecution in matters of religion. The Politiques were particularly\r\npatriotic, and they blamed the religious wars and the intolerant policy\r\nof the Guises for the seeming weakness of the French monarchy. They\r\nthought the massacre of Saint Bartholomew's Day a blunder as well as a\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nThe emergence of the Politiques did not immediately make for peace;\r\nrather, it substituted a three-sided for a two-sided conflict.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip II and the War of the Three Henries]\r\n\r\nAfter many years, filled with disorder, it became apparent that the\r\nchildren of Catherine de' Medici would have no direct male heirs and\r\nthat the crown would therefore legally devolve upon the son of Anthony\r\nof Bourbon--Henry of Bourbon, king of Navarre and a Protestant. Such an\r\noutcome was naturally distasteful to the Guises and abhorrent to Philip\r\nII of Spain. In 1585 a definite league was formed between Henry, duke\r\nof Guise, and the Spanish king, whereby the latter undertook by\r\nmilitary force to aid the former's family in seizing the throne: French\r\npolitics in that event would be controlled by Spain, and Philip would\r\nsecure valuable assistance in crushing the Netherlands and conquering\r\nEngland.[Footnote: At that very time, Mary, Queen of Scots, cousin of\r\nHenry, duke of Guise, was held a prisoner in England by Queen\r\nElizabeth. See above, p. 99.] The immediate outcome of the agreement\r\nwas the war of the three Henries--Henry III, son of Catherine de'\r\nMedici and king of France; Henry of Bourbon, king of Navarre and heir\r\nto the French throne; and Henry, duke of Guise, with the foreign\r\nsupport of Philip II of Spain. Henry of Guise represented the extreme\r\nCatholic party; Henry of Navarre, the Protestant faction; and Henry of\r\nFrance, the Catholic moderates--the Politiques--who wanted peace and\r\nwere willing to grant a measure of toleration. The last two were\r\nupholders of French independence against the encroachments of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe king was speedily gotten into the power of the Guises, but little\r\nheadway was made by the extreme Catholics against Henry of Navarre, who\r\nnow received domestic aid from the _Politiques_ and foreign\r\nassistance from Queen Elizabeth of England and who benefited by the\r\ncontinued misfortunes of Philip II. At no time was the Spanish king\r\nable to devote his whole attention and energy to the French war. At\r\nlength in 1588 Henry III caused Henry of Guise to be assassinated. The\r\nking never had a real chance to prove whether he could become a\r\nnational leader in expelling the foreigners and putting an end to civil\r\nwar, for he himself was assassinated in 1589. With his dying breath he\r\ndesignated the king of Navarre as his successor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry of Navarre]\r\n\r\nHenry of Navarre, the first of the Bourbon family upon the throne of\r\nFrance, took the title of Henry IV (1589-1610). [Footnote: It is a\r\ncurious fact that Henry of Navarre, like Henry of Guise and Henry of\r\nFrance, died by the hand of an assassin.] For four years after his\r\naccession, Henry IV was obliged to continue the civil war, but his\r\nabjuration of Protestantism and his acceptance of Catholicism in 1593\r\nremoved the chief source of opposition to him within France, and the\r\nrebellion speedily collapsed. With the Spanish king, however, the\r\nstruggle dragged on until the treaty of Vervins, which in the last year\r\nof Philip's life practically confirmed the peace of Cateau-Cambrésis.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decline of Spain and Rise of France]\r\n\r\nThus Philip II had failed to conquer or to dismember France. He had\r\nbeen unable to harmonize French policies with those of his own in the\r\nNetherlands or in England. Despite his endeavors, the French crown was\r\nnow on the head of one of his enemies, who, if something of a renegade\r\nProtestant himself, had nevertheless granted qualified toleration to\r\nheretics. Nor were these failures of Philip's political and religious\r\npolicies mere negative results to France. The unsuccessful interference\r\nof the Spanish king contributed to the assurance of French\r\nindependence, patriotism, and solidarity. France, not Spain, was to be\r\nthe center of European politics during the succeeding century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip II and the Turks]\r\n\r\nIn concluding this chapter, a large section of which has been devoted\r\nto an account of the manifold failures of Philip II, a word should be\r\nadded about one exploit that brought glory to the Spanish monarch. It\r\nwas he who administered the first effective check to the advancing\r\nOttoman Turks.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Suleiman the Magnificent (1566), the Turks continued\r\nto strengthen their hold upon Hungary and to fit out piratical\r\nexpeditions in the Mediterranean. The latter repeatedly ravaged\r\nportions of Sicily, southern Italy, and even the Balearic Islands, and\r\nin 1570 an Ottoman fleet captured Cyprus from the Venetians. Malta and\r\nCrete remained as the only Christian outposts in the Mediterranean. In\r\nthis extremity, a league was formed to save Italy. Its inspirer and\r\npreacher was Pope Pius V, but Genoa and Venice furnished the bulk of\r\nthe fleet, while Philip II supplied the necessary additional ships and\r\nthe commander-in-chief in the person of his half-brother, Don John of\r\nAustria. The expedition, which comprised 208 vessels, met the Ottoman\r\nfleet of 273 ships in the Gulf of Lepanto, off the coast of Greece, on\r\n7 October, 1571, and inflicted upon it a crushing defeat. The Turkish\r\nwarships were almost all sunk or driven ashore; it is estimated that\r\n8000 Turks lost their lives. When news of the victory reached Rome,\r\nPope Pius intoned the famous verse, \"There was a man sent from God\r\nwhose name was John.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lepanto]\r\n\r\nThe battle of Lepanto was of great political importance. It gave the\r\nnaval power of the Mohammedans a blow from which it never recovered and\r\nended their aggressive warfare in the Mediterranean. It was, in\r\nreality, the last Crusade: Philip II was in his most becoming rôle as\r\nchampion of church and pope; hardly a noble family in Spain or Italy\r\nwas not represented in the battle; volunteers came from all parts of\r\nthe world; the celebrated Spanish writer Cervantes lost an arm at\r\nLepanto. Western Europe was henceforth to be comparatively free from\r\nthe Ottoman peril.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HABSBURG FAMILY IN THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH\r\nCENTURIES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VALOIS, BOURBON, AND GUISE FAMILIES, PHILIP OF SPAIN\r\nAND MARY, QUEEN OF SCOTS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOUSE OF TUDOR: SOVEREIGNS OF ENGLAND (1485-1603)]\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL READING\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE HABSBURG TERRITORIES.

(2) The Church was not supported by voluntary contributions\r\nas now, but by compulsory taxes; every person was compelled to assist\r\nin defraying the expenses of the official religion. (3) The state\r\nundertook to enforce obedience on the part of its subjects to the\r\nChurch; a person attacking the authority of the Catholic Church would\r\nbe liable to punishment by the state, and this held true in England and\r\nGermany as well as in Spain or Italy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rise of Protestantism]\r\n\r\nThen, within fifty years, between 1520 and 1570, a large number of\r\nCatholic Christians, particularly in Germany, Scandinavia, Scotland,\r\nand England, and a smaller number in the Low Countries and in France,\r\nbroke off communion with the ancient Church and became known as\r\nProtestants. Before the year 1500 there were no Protestants; since the\r\nsixteenth century, the dominant Christianity of western and central\r\nEurope has been divided into two parts--Catholic and Protestant. It is\r\nimportant that we should know something of the origin and significance\r\nof this division, because the Christian religion and the Christian\r\nChurch had long played very great roles in the evolution of European\r\ncivilization and because ecclesiastical and religious questions have\r\ncontinued, since the division, to deserve general attention.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Catholic\" Christianity]\r\n\r\nLet us understand clearly what was meant in the year 1500 by the\r\nexpression \"Catholic Christianity.\" It embraced a belief in certain\r\nreligious precepts which it was believed Jesus of Nazareth had taught\r\nat the beginning of the Christian era, the inculcation of certain moral\r\nteachings which were likewise derived from Jesus, and a definite\r\norganization--the Church--founded, it was assumed, by Jesus in order to\r\nteach and practice, till the end of time, His religious and moral\r\ndoctrines. By means of the Church, man would know best how to order his\r\nlife in this world and how to prepare his soul for everlasting\r\nhappiness in the world to come.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Catholic Church]\r\n\r\nThe Catholic Church was, therefore, a vast human society, believed to\r\nbe of divine foundation and sanction, and with a mission greater and\r\nmore lofty than that of any other organization. Church and state had\r\neach its own sphere, but the Church had insisted for centuries that it\r\nwas greater and more necessary than the state. The members of the\r\nChurch were the sum-total of Christian believers who had been baptized\r\n--practically the population of western and central Europe--and its\r\nofficers constituted a regular governing hierarchy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Head of the Church]\r\n\r\nAt the head of the hierarchy was the bishop of Rome, styled the pope or\r\nsovereign pontiff, who from the first had probably enjoyed a leading\r\nposition in the Church as the successor of St. Peter, prince of the\r\napostles, and whose claims to be the divinely appointed chief bishop\r\nhad been generally recognized throughout western Europe as early as the\r\nthird century--perhaps earlier. The bishop of Rome was elected for life\r\nby a group of clergymen, called cardinals, who originally had been in\r\ndirect charge of the parish churches in the city of Rome, but who later\r\nwere frequently selected by the pope from various countries because\r\nthey were distinguished churchmen. The pope chose the cardinals; the\r\ncardinals elected the pope. Part of the cardinals resided in Rome, and\r\nin conjunction with a host of clerks, translators, lawyers, and special\r\nofficials, constituted the _Curia_, or papal court, for the\r\nconduct of general church business.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Local Administration of the Church]\r\n[Sidenote: Secular Clergy]\r\n\r\nFor the local administration of church affairs, the Catholic world was\r\ndivided under the pope into several territorial subdivisions, (1) The\r\npatriarchates had been under patriarchs who had their sees [Footnote:\r\n\"See,\" so called from the Latin _sedes_, referring to their seat\r\nor chair of office. Similarly our word \"cathedral\" is derived from the\r\nLatin _cathedra_, the official chair which the bishop occupies in\r\nhis own church.] in such ancient Christian centers as Rome. Jerusalem,\r\nAlexandria, Antioch. and Constantinople. (2) The provinces were\r\ndivisions of the patriarchates and usually centered in the most\r\nimportant cities, such as Milan, Florence, Cologne, Upsala, Lyons,\r\nSeville, Lisbon, Canterbury, York; and the head of each was styled a\r\nmetropolitan or archbishop. (3) The diocese--the most essential unit of\r\nlocal administration--was a subdivision of the province, commonly a\r\ncity or a town, with a certain amount of surrounding country, under the\r\nimmediate supervision of a bishop. (4) Smaller divisions, particularly\r\nparishes, were to be found in every diocese, embracing a village or a\r\nsection of a city, and each parish had its church building and its\r\npriest. Thus the Catholic Church possessed a veritable army of\r\nofficials from pope and cardinals down through patriarchs, archbishops,\r\nand bishops, to the parish priests and their assistants, the deacons.\r\nThis hierarchy, because it labored _in the world_ (_sæculo_),\r\nwas called the \"secular clergy.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Regular\" Clergy]\r\n\r\nAnother variety of clergy--the \"regulars\"--supplemented the work of the\r\nseculars. The regulars were monks, [Footnote: The word \"monk\" is\r\napplied, of course, only to men; women who followed similar rules are\r\ncommonly styled nuns.] that is, Christians who lived by a special\r\n_rule_ (_regula_), who renounced the world, took vows of\r\nchastity, poverty, and obedience, and strove to imitate the life of\r\nChrist as literally as possible. The regular clergy were organized\r\nunder their own abbots, priors, provincials, or generals, being usually\r\nexempt from secular jurisdiction, except that of the pope. The regulars\r\nwere the great missionaries of the Church, and many charitable and\r\neducational institutions were in their hands. Among the various orders\r\nof monks which had grown up in the course of time, the following should\r\nbe enumerated: (1) The monks who lived in fixed abodes, tilled the\r\nsoil, copied manuscripts, and conducted local schools. Most of the\r\nmonks of this kind followed a rule, or society by-laws, which had been\r\nprepared by the celebrated St. Benedict about the year 525: they were\r\ncalled therefore Benedictines. (2) The monks who organized crusades,\r\noften bore arms themselves, and tended the holy places connected with\r\nincidents in the life of Christ: such orders were the Knights Templars,\r\nthe Knights Hospitalers of St. John and of Malta, and the Teutonic\r\nKnights who subsequently undertook the conversion of the Slavs. (3) The\r\nmonks who were called the begging friars or mendicants because they had\r\nno fixed abode but wandered from place to place, preaching to the\r\ncommon people and dependent for their own living upon alms. These\r\norders came into prominence in the thirteenth century and included,\r\namong others, the Franciscan, whose lovable founder Saint Francis of\r\nAssisi had urged humility and love of the poor as its distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics, and the Dominican, or Order of the Preachers, devoted\r\nby the precept of its practical founder, Saint Dominic, to missionary\r\nzeal. All the mendicant orders, as well as the Benedictine monasteries,\r\nbecame famous in the history of education, and the majority of the\r\ndistinguished scholars of the middle ages were monks. It was not\r\nuncommon, moreover, for regulars to enter the secular hierarchy and\r\nthus become parish priests or bishops, or even popes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Church Councils]\r\n[Sidenote: Conciliar Movement]\r\n\r\nThe clergy--bishops, priests, and deacons--constituted, in popular\r\nbelief, the divinely ordained administration of the Catholic Church.\r\nThe legislative authority in the Church similarly was vested in the\r\npope and in the general councils, neither of which, however, could set\r\naside a law of God, as affirmed in the gospels, or establish a doctrine\r\nat variance with the tradition of the early Christian writers. The\r\ngeneral councils were assemblies of prelates of the Catholic world, and\r\nthere had been considerable discussion as to the relative authority of\r\ntheir decrees and the decisions and directions of the pope. [Footnote:\r\nPapal documents have been called by various names, such as decretals,\r\nbulls, or encyclicals.] General church councils held in eastern Europe\r\nfrom the fourth to the ninth centuries had issued important decrees or\r\ncanons defining Christian dogmas and establishing ecclesiastical\r\ndiscipline, which had been subsequently ratified and promulgated by the\r\npope as by other bishops and by the emperors; and several councils had\r\nbeen held in western Europe from the twelfth to the fourteenth\r\ncenturies under the direct supervision of the bishop of Rome, all the\r\ncanons of which had been enacted in accordance with his wishes. But\r\nearly in the fifteenth century a movement was inaugurated by certain\r\nCatholic bishops and scholars in favor of making the councils superior\r\nto the pope and a regular source of supreme legislation for the Church.\r\nIn this way, the councils of Constance (1414-1418) and Basel (1431 ff.)\r\nhad endeavored to introduce representative, if not democratic,\r\ngovernment into the Church. The popes, however, objected to this\r\nconciliar movement and managed to have it condemned by the Council of\r\nFerrara-Florence (1438-1442). By the year 1512 the papal theory had\r\ntriumphed and Catholics generally recognized again that the government\r\nof the Church was essentially monarchical. The laws of the Catholic\r\nChurch were known as canons, and, of several codes of canon law which\r\nhad been prepared, that of a monk named Gratian, compiled in the\r\ntwelfth century, was the most widely used.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Pope and his Powers]\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to summarize the claims and prerogatives of\r\nthe bishop of Rome or pope. (1) He was the supreme lawgiver. He could\r\nissue decrees of his own, which might not be set aside by any other\r\nperson. No council might enact canons without his approval. From any\r\nlaw, other than divine, he might dispense persons. (2) He was the\r\nsupreme judge in Christendom. He claimed that appeals might be taken\r\nfrom decisions in foreign courts to his own Curia, as court of last\r\nresort. He himself frequently acted as arbitrator, as, for example, in\r\nthe famous dispute between Spain and Portugal concerning the boundaries\r\nof their newly discovered possessions. (3) He was the supreme\r\nadministrator. He claimed the right to supervise the general business\r\nof the whole Church. No archbishop might perform the functions of his\r\noffice until he received his insignia--the pallium--from the pope. No\r\nbishop might be canonically installed until his election had been\r\nconfirmed by the pope. The pope claimed the right to transfer a bishop\r\nfrom one diocese to another and to settle all disputed elections. He\r\nexercised immediate control over the regular clergy--the monks and\r\nnuns. He sent ambassadors, styled legates, to represent him at the\r\nvarious royal courts and to see that his instructions were obeyed. (4)\r\nHe insisted upon certain temporal rights, as distinct from his directly\r\nreligious prerogatives. He crowned the Holy Roman Emperor. He might\r\ndepose an emperor or king and release a ruler's subjects from their\r\noath of allegiance. He might declare null and void, and forbid the\r\npeople to obey, a law of any state, if he thought it was injurious to\r\nthe interests of the Church. He was temporal ruler of the city of Rome\r\nand the surrounding papal states, and over those territories he\r\nexercised a power similar to that of any duke or king. (5) He claimed\r\nfinancial powers. In order to defray the enormous expenses of his\r\ngovernment, he charged fees for certain services at Rome, assessed the\r\ndioceses throughout the Catholic world, and levied a small tax--Peter's\r\nPence--upon all Christian householders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Purpose of the Church]\r\n\r\nSo far we have concerned ourselves with the organization of the\r\nCatholic Church--its membership, its officers, the clergy, secular and\r\nregular, all culminating in the pope, the bishop of Rome. But why did\r\nthis great institution exist? Why was it loved, venerated, and well\r\nserved? The purpose of the Church, according to its own teaching, was\r\nto follow the instructions of its Divine Master, Jesus Christ, in\r\nsaving souls. Only the Church might interpret those instructions; the\r\nChurch alone might apply the means of salvation; outside the Church no\r\none could be saved. [Footnote: Catholic theologians have recognized,\r\nhowever, the possibility of salvation of persons outside the visible\r\nChurch. Thus, the catechism of Pope Pius X says: \"Whoever, without any\r\nfault of his own, and in good faith, being outside the Church, happens\r\nto have been baptized or to have at least an implicit desire for\r\nbaptism, and, furthermore, has been sincere in seeking to find the\r\ntruth, and has done his best to do the will of God, such an one,\r\nalthough separated from the body of the Church, would still belong to\r\nher soul, and therefore be in the way of salvation.\"] The salvation of\r\nsouls for eternity was thus the supreme business of the Church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Theology]\r\n\r\nThis salvation of souls involved a theology and a sacramental system,\r\nwhich we shall proceed to explain. Theology was the study of God. It\r\nsought to explain how and why man was created, what were his actual and\r\ndesirable relations with God, what would be the fate of man in a future\r\nlife. The most famous theologians of the Catholic Church, for example,\r\nSt. Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274), studied carefully the teachings of\r\nChrist, the Bible, the early Christian writings, and the decrees of\r\npopes and councils, and drew therefrom elaborate explanations of\r\nChristian theology--the dogmas and faith of the Catholic Church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sacramental System]\r\n\r\nThe very center of Catholic theology was the sacramental system, for\r\nthat was the means, and essentially the only means, of saving souls. It\r\nwas, therefore, for the purpose of the sacramental system that the\r\nChurch and its hierarchy existed. The sacraments were believed to have\r\nbeen instituted by Christ Himself, and were defined as \"outward signs\r\ninstituted by Christ to give grace.\" The number generally accepted was\r\nseven: baptism, confirmation, holy eucharist, penance, extreme unction,\r\nholy orders, and matrimony. By means of the sacraments the Church\r\naccompanied the faithful throughout life. Baptism, the pouring of\r\nwater, cleansed the child from original sin and from all previous\r\nactual sins, and made him a Christian, a child of God, and an heir of\r\nheaven. The priest was the ordinary minister of baptism, but in case of\r\nnecessity any one who had the use of reason might baptize.\r\nConfirmation, conferred usually by a bishop upon young persons by the\r\nlaying on of hands and the anointing with oil, gave them the Holy Ghost\r\nto render them strong and perfect Christians and soldiers of Jesus\r\nChrist. Penance, one of the most important sacraments, was intended to\r\nforgive sins committed after baptism. To receive the sacrament of\r\npenance worthily it was necessary for the penitent (1) to examine his\r\nconscience, (2) to have sorrow for his sins, (3) to make a firm\r\nresolution never more to offend God, (4) to confess his mortal sins\r\norally to a priest, (5) to receive absolution from the priest, (6) to\r\naccept the particular penance--visitation of churches, saying of\r\ncertain prayers, or almsgiving--which the priest might enjoin. The holy\r\neucharist was the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, the consecration of\r\nbread and wine by priest or bishop, its miraculous transformation\r\n(transubstantiation) at his word into the very Body and Blood of\r\nChrist, and its reception by the faithful. It was around the eucharist\r\nthat the elaborate ritual and ceremonies of the Mass developed, that\r\nfine vestments and candles and incense and flowers were used, and that\r\nmagnificent cathedrals were erected. Extreme unction was the anointing\r\nat the hands of a priest of the Christian who was in immediate danger\r\nof death, and it was supposed to give health and strength to the soul\r\nand sometimes to the body. By means of holy orders,--the special\r\nimposition of hands on the part of a bishop,--priests, bishops, and\r\nother ministers of the Church were ordained and received the power and\r\ngrace to perform their sacred duties. Matrimony was the sacrament, held\r\nto be indissoluble by human power, by which man and woman were united\r\nin lawful Christian marriage.\r\n\r\nOf the seven sacraments it will be noticed that two--baptism and\r\npenance--dealt with the forgiveness of sins, and that two--holy orders\r\nand matrimony--were received only by certain persons. Three--baptism,\r\nconfirmation, and holy orders--could be received by a Christian only\r\nonce. Two--confirmation and holy orders--required the ministry of a\r\nbishop; and all others, except baptism and possibly matrimony, required\r\nthe ministry of at least a priest. The priesthood was, therefore, the\r\nabsolutely indispensable agent of the Church in the administration of\r\nthe sacramental system. It was the priesthood that absolved penitents\r\nfrom their sins, wrought the great daily miracle of transubstantiation,\r\nand offered to God the holy sacrifice of the Mass.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Various Objections to the Church]\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that either the theology or the organization of\r\nthe Catholic Church, as they existed in the year 1500, had been\r\nprecisely the same throughout the Christian era. While educated\r\nCatholics insisted that Christ was indirectly the source of all faith\r\nand all practice, they were quite willing to admit that external\r\nchanges and adaptations of institutions to varying conditions had taken\r\nplace. Moreover, it must not be supposed that the proud eminence to\r\nwhich the Catholic Church had attained by 1500 in central and western\r\nEurope had been won easily or at that time was readily maintained.\r\nThroughout the whole course of Christian history there had been\r\nrepeated objections to new definitions of dogma--many positively\r\nrefused to accept the teaching of the Church as divine or infallible--\r\nand there had been likewise a good deal of opposition to the temporal\r\nclaims of the Church, resulting in increasing friction between the\r\nclergy and the lay rulers. Thus it often transpired that the kings who\r\nvied with one another in recognizing the spiritual and religious\r\nheadship of the pope and in burning heretics who denied doctrines of\r\nthe Catholic Church, were the very kings who quarreled with the pope\r\nconcerning the latter's civil jurisdiction and directed harsh laws\r\nagainst its exercise.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sources of Conflict between Church and State]\r\n\r\nAs strong national monarchies rose in western Europe, this friction\r\nbecame more acute. On one side the royal power was determined to exalt\r\nthe state and to bring into subjection to it not only the nobles and\r\ncommon people but the clergy as well; the national state must manage\r\nabsolutely every temporal affair. On the other side, the clergy stoutly\r\ndefended the special powers that they had long enjoyed in various\r\nstates and which they believed to be rightly theirs. There were\r\n_four_ chief sources of conflict between the temporal and\r\nspiritual jurisdictions, (1) Appointments of bishops, abbots, and other\r\nhigh church officers. Inasmuch as these were usually foremost citizens\r\nof their native kingdom, holding large estates and actually\r\nparticipating in the conduct of government, the kings frequently\r\nclaimed the right to dictate their election. On the other hand the\r\npopes insisted upon their rights in the matter and often \"reserved\" to\r\nthemselves the appointment to certain valuable bishoprics. (2) Taxation\r\nof land and other property of the clergy. The clergy insisted that by\r\nright they were exempt from taxation and that in practice they had not\r\nbeen taxed since the first public recognition of Christianity in the\r\nfourth century. The kings pointed out that the wealth of the clergy and\r\nthe needs of the state had increased along parallel lines, that the\r\nclergy were citizens of the state and should pay a just share for its\r\nmaintenance. (3) Ecclesiastical courts. For several centuries the\r\nChurch had maintained its own courts for trying clerical offenders and\r\nfor hearing certain cases, which nowadays are heard in state courts--\r\nprobating of wills, the marriage relations, blasphemy, etc. From these\r\nlocal church courts, the pope insisted that appeals might be taken to\r\nthe Roman Curia. On their side, the kings were resolved to substitute\r\nroyal justice for that of both feudal and ecclesiastical courts: they\r\ndiminished, therefore, the privileges of the local church courts and\r\nforbade the taking of appeals to Rome. (4) How far might the pope, as\r\nuniversally acknowledged head of the Church, interfere in the internal\r\naffairs of particular states? While the pope claimed to be the sole\r\njudge of his own rights and powers, several kings forbade the\r\npublication of papal documents within their states or the reception of\r\npapal legates unless the royal assent had been vouchsafed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Royal Restrictions on the Church]\r\n\r\nGradually the national monarchs secured at least a partial control over\r\nepiscopal appointments, and in both England and France papal\r\njurisdiction was seriously restricted in other ways. In England the\r\npower of the ecclesiastical courts had been reduced (1164); no property\r\nmight be bestowed upon the Church without royal permission (1279); the\r\npope might not make provision in England for his personal appointees to\r\noffice (1351); and appeals to Rome had been forbidden (1392).\r\n[Footnote: All these anti-papal enactments were very poorly enforced.]\r\nIn France the clergy had been taxed early in the fourteenth century,\r\nand the papacy, which had condemned such action, had been humiliated by\r\na forced temporary removal from Rome to Avignon, where it was\r\ncontrolled by French rulers for nearly seventy years (1309-1377); and\r\nin 1438 the French king, Charles VII, in a document, styled the\r\nPragmatic Sanction of Bourges, solemnly proclaimed the \"liberties of\r\nthe Gallican Church,\" that a general council was superior to the pope,\r\nthat the pope might not interfere in episcopal elections, that he might\r\nnot levy taxes on French dioceses. The Pragmatic Sanction was condemned\r\nby the pope, but for three-quarters of a century after its issuance\r\nthere were strained relations between the Church in France and the\r\nsovereign pontiff.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political Differences Distinct from Religious Differences]\r\n\r\nSimilar conflicts between spiritual and temporal jurisdictions were\r\ncommon to all Christian states, but the national strength and the\r\npatriotism of the western monarchies caused them to proceed further\r\nthan any other state in restricting the papal privileges. Despite the\r\nconflict over temporal affairs, which at times was exceedingly bitter,\r\nthe kings and rulers of England and France never appear to have\r\nseriously questioned the religious authority of the Church or the\r\nspiritual supremacy of the pope. Religiously, the Catholic Church\r\nseemed in 1500 to hold absolute sway over all central and western\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Religious Opposition to Catholicism]\r\n\r\nYet this very religious authority of the Catholic Church had been again\r\nand again brought into question and repeatedly rejected. Originally, a\r\nunited Christianity had conquered western Asia, northern Africa, and\r\neastern Europe; by 1500 nearly all these wide regions were lost to\r\nCatholic Christianity as that phrase was understood in western Europe.\r\nThe loss was due to (1) the development of a great Christian schism,\r\nand (2) the rise of a new religion--Mohammedanism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Schism between the East and the West]\r\n\r\nEastern Europe had been lost through an ever-widening breach in\r\nChristian practice from the fifth to the eleventh century. The Eastern\r\nChurch used the Greek language in its liturgy; that of the West used\r\nthe Latin language. The former remained more dependent upon the state;\r\nthe latter grew less dependent. Minor differences of doctrine appeared.\r\nAnd the Eastern Christians thought the pope was usurping unwarrantable\r\nprerogatives, while the Western Christians accused the Oriental\r\npatriarchs of departing from their earlier loyalty to the pope and\r\ndestroying the unity of Christendom. Several attempts had been made to\r\nreunite the Catholic Church of the West and the Orthodox Church of the\r\nEast, but with slight success. In 1500, the Christians of Greece, the\r\nBalkan peninsula, and Russia were thought to be outside the Catholic\r\nChurch and were defined, therefore, by the pope as schismatics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mohammedanism]\r\n\r\nFar more numerous and dangerous to Catholic Christianity than the\r\nschismatic Easterners were the Mohammedans. Mohammed himself had lived\r\nin Arabia in the early part the seventh century and had taught that he\r\nwas the inspired prophet of the one true God. In a celebrated book,--\r\nthe Koran,--which was compiled from the sayings of the prophet, are to\r\nbe found the precepts and commandments of the Mohammedan religion.\r\nMohammedanism spread rapidly: within a hundred years of its founder's\r\ndeath it had conquered western Asia and northern Africa and had gained\r\na temporary foothold in Spain; thenceforth it stretched eastward across\r\nPersia and Turkestan into India and southward into central Africa; and\r\nin the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, as we have seen, it\r\npossessed itself of Constantinople, the Balkans, Greece, and part of\r\nHungary, and threatened Christendom in the Germanies and in the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Western Heresies]\r\n\r\nEven in western Europe, the Catholic Church had had to encounter\r\nspasmodic opposition from \"heretics,\" as those persons were called who,\r\nalthough baptized as Christians, refused to accept all the dogmas of\r\nCatholic Christianity. Such were the Arian Christians, who in early\r\ntimes had been condemned for rejecting the doctrine of the divinity of\r\nChrist, and who had eventually been won back to Catholicism only with\r\nthe greatest efforts. Then in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the\r\nAlbigensian heretics in southern France had assailed the sacramental\r\nsystem and the organization of the Church and had been suppressed only\r\nby armed force. In the fourteenth century, John Wycliffe appeared in\r\nEngland and John Hus in Bohemia, both preaching that the individual\r\nChristian needs no priestly mediation between himself and God and that\r\nthe very sacraments of the Church, however desirable, are not\r\nessentially necessary to salvation. The Lollards, as Wycliffe's English\r\nfollowers were called, were speedily extirpated by fire and sword,\r\nthrough the stern orthodoxy of an English king, but the Hussites long\r\ndefied the pope and survivals of their heresy were to be found in 1500.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Skeptics]\r\n\r\nIn addition to these heretics and the Jews, [Footnote: For detailed\r\naccounts of the Jews during the middle ages as well as in modern times,\r\nsee the _Jewish Encyclopædia_, ed. by Isidore Singer, 12 vols.\r\n(1901-1906).] many so-called skeptics no doubt existed. These were\r\npeople who outwardly conformed to Catholicism but inwardly doubted and\r\neven scoffed at the very foundations of Christianity. They were\r\nessentially irreligious, but they seem to have suffered less from\r\npersecution than the heretics. Many of the Italian humanists,\r\nconcerning whom we shall later say a word, [Footnote: See below] were\r\nin the fifteenth century more or less avowed skeptics.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROTESTANT REVOLT\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Religious and Political Movement]\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the preceding pages that prior to 1500 there had been\r\nmany conflicts between kings and popes concerning their respective\r\ntemporal rights and likewise there had been serious doubts in the minds\r\nof various people as to the authority and teachings of the Catholic\r\nChurch. But these two facts--political and religious--had never been\r\nunited in a general revolt against the Church until the sixteenth\r\ncentury. Then it was that Christians of Germany, Scandinavia, Scotland,\r\nand England, even of the Low Countries and France, successfully\r\nrevolted against the papal monarchy and set up establishments of their\r\nown, usually under the protection of their lay rulers, which became\r\nknown as the Protestant churches. The movement is called, therefore,\r\nthe Protestant Revolt. It was begun and practically completed between\r\n1520 and 1570.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political Causes of Protestant Revolt]\r\n\r\nIn explaining this remarkable and sudden break with the religious and\r\necclesiastical development of a thousand years, it is well to bear in\r\nmind that its causes were at once political, economic, and religious.\r\nPolitically, it was merely an accentuation of the conflict which had\r\nlong been increasing in virulence between the spiritual and temporal\r\nauthorities. It cannot be stated too emphatically that the Catholic\r\nChurch during many centuries prior to the sixteenth had been not only a\r\nreligious body, like a present-day church, but also a vast political\r\npower which readily found sources of friction with other political\r\ninstitutions. The Catholic Church, as we have seen, had its own\r\nelaborate organization in every country of western and central Europe;\r\nand its officials--pope, bishops, priests, and monks--denied allegiance\r\nto the secular government; the Church owned many valuable lands and\r\nestates, which normally were exempt from taxation and virtually outside\r\nthe jurisdiction of the lay government; the Church had its own\r\nindependent and compulsory income, and its own courts to try its own\r\nofficers and certain kinds of cases for every one. Such political\r\njurisdiction of the Church had been quite needful and satisfactory in\r\nthe period--from the fifth to the twelfth century, let us say--when the\r\nsecular governments were weak and the Church found itself the chief\r\nunifying force in Christendom, the veritable heir to the universal\r\ndominion of the ancient Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nBut gradually the temporal rulers themselves repressed feudalism.\r\nPolitical ambition increased in laymen, and local pride was exalted\r\ninto patriotism. By the year 1200 was begun the growth of that notable\r\nidea of national monarchy, the general outline of which we sketched in\r\nthe opening chapter. We there indicated that at the commencement of the\r\nsixteenth century, England, France, Spain, and Portugal had become\r\nstrong states, with well-organized lay governments under powerful\r\nkings, with patriotic populations, and with well-developed, distinctive\r\nlanguages and literatures. The one thing that seemed to be needed to\r\ncomplete this national sovereignty was to bring the Church entirely\r\nunder royal control. The autocratic sovereigns desired to enlist the\r\nwealth and influence of the Church in their behalf; they coveted her\r\nlands, her taxes, and her courts. Although Italy, the Netherlands, and\r\nthe Germanies were not yet developed as strong united monarchies, many\r\nof their patriotic leaders longed for such a development, worked for\r\nit, and believed that the principal obstacle to it was the great\r\nChristian Church with the pope at its head. Viewed from the political\r\nstandpoint, the Protestant Revolt was caused by the rise of national\r\nfeeling, which found itself in natural conflict with the older\r\ncosmopolitan or catholic idea of the Church. It was nationalism\r\n_versus_ Catholicism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Economic Causes of Protestant Revolt]\r\n\r\nEconomically, the causes of the Protestant Revolt were twofold. In the\r\nfirst place, the Catholic Church had grown so wealthy that many people,\r\nparticularly kings and princes, coveted her possessions. In the second\r\nplace, financial abuses in ecclesiastical administration bore heavily\r\nupon the common people and created serious scandal. Let us say a word\r\nabout each one of these difficulties.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the sixteenth century, many bishops and abbots in\r\nwealth and power were not unlike great lay lords: they held vast fair\r\ndominions--in the Germanics a third of the whole country, in France a\r\nfifth, etc.--and they were attended by armies of retainers. Most of\r\nthem were sons of noblemen who had had them consecrated bishops so as\r\nto insure them fine positions. Even the monks, who now often lived in\r\nrich monasteries as though they had never taken vows of poverty, were\r\nsometimes of noble birth and quite worldly in their lives. The large\r\nestates and vast revenues of Catholic ecclesiastics were thus at first\r\nthe lure and then the prey of their royal and princely neighbors. The\r\nlatter grew quite willing to utilize any favorable opportunity which\r\nmight enable them to confiscate church property and add it to their own\r\npossessions. Later such confiscation was euphemistically styled\r\n\"secularization.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many plain people, such as peasants and artisans,\r\nbegrudged the numerous and burdensome ecclesiastical taxes, and an\r\nincreasing number felt that they were not getting the worth of their\r\nmoney. There was universal complaint, particularly in the Germanies,\r\nthat the people were exploited by the Roman Curia. Each ecclesiastic,\r\nbe he bishop, abbot, or priest, had right to a benefice, that is, to\r\nthe revenue of a parcel of land attached to his post. When he took\r\npossession of a benefice, he paid the pope a special assessment, called\r\nthe \"annate,\" amounting to a year's income--which of course came from\r\nthe peasants living on the land. The pope likewise \"reserved\" to\r\nhimself the right of naming the holders of certain benefices: these he\r\ngave preferably to Italians who drew the revenues but remained in their\r\nown country; the people thus supported foreign prelates in luxury and\r\nsometimes paid a second time in order to maintain resident\r\necclesiastics. The archbishops paid enormous sums to the pope for their\r\nbadges of office (_pallia_). Fat fees for dispensations or for\r\ncourt trials found their way across the Alps. And the bulk of the\r\nburden ultimately rested upon the backs of the people. At least in the\r\nGermanics the idea became very prevalent that the pope and Curia were\r\nreally robbing honest German Christians for the benefit of scandalously\r\nimmoral Italians.\r\n\r\nThere were certainly grave financial abuses in church government in the\r\nfifteenth century and in the early part of the sixteenth. A project of\r\nGerman reform, drawn up in 1438, had declared: \"It is a shame which\r\ncries to heaven, this oppression of tithes, dues, penalties,\r\nexcommunication, and tolls of the peasant, on whose labor all men\r\ndepend for their existence.\" An \"apocalyptic pamphlet of 1508 shows on\r\nits cover the Church upside down, with the peasant performing the\r\nservices, while the priest guides the plow outside and a monk drives\r\nthe horses.\" It was, in fact, in the Germanics that all the social\r\nclasses--princes, burghers, knights, and peasants--had special economic\r\ngrievances against the Church, and in many places were ready to combine\r\nin rejecting papal claims.\r\n\r\nThis emphasis upon the political and particularly upon the economic\r\ncauses need not belittle the strictly religious factor in the movement.\r\nThe success of the revolt was due to the fact that many kings, nobles,\r\nand commoners, for financial and political advantages to themselves,\r\nbecame the valuable allies of real religious reformers. It required\r\ndogmatic differences as well as social grievances to destroy the\r\ndominion of the Church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abuses in the Catholic Church]\r\n\r\nNearly all thoughtful men in the sixteenth century recognized the\r\nexistence of abuses in the Catholic Church. The scandals connected with\r\nthe papal court at Rome were notorious at the opening of the century.\r\nSeveral of the the popes lived grossly immoral lives. Simony (the sale\r\nof church offices for money) and nepotism (favoritism shown by a pope\r\nto his relatives) were not rare. The most lucrative ecclesiastical\r\npositions throughout Europe were frequently conferred upon Italians who\r\nseldom discharged their duties. One person might be made bishop of\r\nseveral foreign dioceses and yet continue to reside in Rome. Leo X, who\r\nwas pope when the Protestant Revolt began, and son of Lorenzo de'\r\nMedici, surnamed the Magnificent, had been ordained to the priesthood\r\nat the age of seven, named cardinal when he was thirteen, and speedily\r\nloaded with a multitude of rich benefices and preferments; this same\r\npope, by his munificence and extravagance, was forced to resort to the\r\nmost questionable means for raising money: he created many new offices\r\nand shamelessly sold them; he increased the revenue from indulgences,\r\njubilees, and regular taxation; he pawned palace furniture, table\r\nplate, pontifical jewels, even statues of the apostles; several banking\r\nfirms and many individual creditors were ruined by his death.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attacks on Immorality of Clergymen]\r\n\r\nWhat immorality and worldliness prevailed at Rome was reflected in the\r\nlives of many lesser churchmen. To one of the popes of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, a distinguished cardinal represented the disorders of the\r\nclergy, especially in the Germanics. \"These disorders,\" he said,\r\n\"excite the hatred of the people against all ecclesiastical order; if\r\nit is not corrected, it is to be feared that the laity, following the\r\nexample of the Hussites, will attack the clergy as they now openly\r\nmenace us with doing.\" If the clergy of Germany were not reformed\r\npromptly, he predicted that after the Bohemian heresy was crushed\r\nanother would speedily arise far more dangerous. \"For they will say,\"\r\nhe continued, \"that the clergy is incorrigible and is willing to apply\r\nno remedy to its disorders. They will attack us when they no longer\r\nhave any hope of our correction. Men's minds are waiting for what shall\r\nbe done; it seems as if shortly something tragic will be brought forth.\r\nThe venom which they have against us is becoming evident; soon they\r\nwill believe they are making a sacrifice agreeable to God by\r\nmaltreating or despoiling the ecclesiastics as people odious to God and\r\nman and immersed to the utmost in evil. The little reverence still\r\nremaining for the sacred order will be destroyed. Responsibility for\r\nall these disorders will be charged upon the Roman Curia, which will be\r\nregarded as the cause of all these evils because it has neglected to\r\napply the necessary remedy.\" To many other thoughtful persons, a moral\r\nreformation in the head and members of the Church seemed vitally\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nComplaints against the evil lives of the clergy as well as against\r\ntheir ignorance and credulity were echoed by most of the great scholars\r\nand humanists of the time. The patriotic knight and vagabond scholar,\r\nUlrich von Hutten (1488-1523), contributed to a clever series of\r\nsatirical \"Letters of Obscure Men,\" which were read widely, and which\r\npoked fun at the lack of learning among the monks and the ease with\r\nwhich the papal court emptied German pockets.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ulrich von Hutten and Erasmus]\r\n\r\nThen, too, the great Erasmus (1466-1536) employed all his wit and\r\nsarcasm, in his celebrated \"Praise of Folly,\" against the theologians\r\nand monks, complaining that the foolish people thought that religion\r\nconsisted simply in pilgrimages, the invocation of saints, and the\r\nveneration of relics. Erasmus would have suppressed the monasteries,\r\nput an end to the domination of the clergy, and swept away scandalous\r\nabuses. He wanted Christianity to regain its early spiritual force, and\r\nlargely for that purpose he published in 1516 the Greek text of the New\r\nTestament with a new Latin translation and with notes which mercilessly\r\nflayed hair-splitting theologians.\r\n\r\nThus throughout the fifteenth century and the early part of the\r\nsixteenth, much was heard from scholars, princes, and people, of the\r\nneed for \"reformation\" of the Church. That did not signify a change of\r\nthe old regulations but rather their restoration and enforcement. For a\r\nlong time it was not a question of abolishing the authority of the\r\npope, or altering ecclesiastical organization, or changing creeds. It\r\nwas merely a question of reforming the lives of the clergy and of\r\nsuppressing the means by which Italians drew money from other nations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Religious Causes of Protestant Revolt]\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century, however, a group of religious leaders, such\r\nas Luther, Cranmer, Zwingli, Calvin, and Knox, went much further than\r\nErasmus and the majority of the humanists had gone: they applied the\r\nword \"reformation\" not only to a reform in morals but to an open break\r\nwhich they made with the government and doctrines of the Catholic\r\nChurch. The new theology, which these reformers championed, was derived\r\nmainly from the teachings of such heretics as Wycliffe and Hus and was\r\nsupposed to depend directly upon the Bible rather than upon the Church.\r\nThe religious causes of the Protestant Revolt accordingly may be summed\r\nup as: first, the existence of abuses within the Catholic Church;\r\nsecond, the attacks of distinguished men upon the immorality and\r\nworldliness of the Catholic clergy; and third, the substitution by\r\ncertain religious leaders of new doctrines and practices, which were\r\npresumed to have been authorized by the Bible, but which were at\r\nvariance with those of the medieval Church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Date and Extent of the Protestant Revolt]\r\n\r\nFor the great variety of reasons, which we have now indicated,--\r\npolitical, economic, and religious,--the peoples of northern Germany,\r\nScandinavia, the Dutch Netherlands, most of Switzerland, Scotland,\r\nEngland, and a part of France and of Hungary, separated themselves,\r\nbetween the years 1520 and 1570, from the great religious and political\r\nbody which had been known historically for over a thousand years as the\r\nCatholic Christian Church. The name \"Protestant\" was first applied\r\nexclusively to those followers of Martin Luther in the Holy Roman\r\nEmpire who in 1529 protested against an attempt of the Diet of Speyer\r\nto prevent the introduction of religious novelties, but subsequently\r\nthe word passed into common parlance among historians and the general\r\nreading public as betokening all Christians who rejected the papal\r\nsupremacy and who were not in communion with the Orthodox Church of\r\neastern Europe.\r\n\r\nOf this Protestant Christianity three main forms appeared in the\r\nsixteenth century--Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Anglicanism. Concerning\r\nthe origin and development of each one of these major forms, a brief\r\nsketch must be given.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUTHERANISM\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Martin Luther]\r\n\r\nLutheranism takes its name from its great apostle, Martin Luther.\r\nLuther was born in Eisleben in Germany in 1483 of a poor family whose\r\nancestors had been peasants. Martin early showed himself bold,\r\nheadstrong, willing to pit his own opinions against those of the world,\r\nbut yet possessing ability, tact, and a love of sound knowledge.\r\nEducated at the university of Erfurt, where he became acquainted with\r\nthe humanistic movement, young Martin entered one of the mendicant\r\norders--the Augustinian--in 1505 and went to live in a monastery. In\r\n1508 Luther was sent with some other monks to Wittenberg to assist a\r\nuniversity which had been opened there recently by the elector of\r\nSaxony, and a few years later was appointed professor of theology in\r\nthe institution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Justification by Faith]\r\n\r\nWhile lecturing and preaching at Wittenberg, where he was very popular,\r\nLuther developed from the writings of St. Paul and St. Augustine an\r\nimportant doctrinal conviction which differed widely from the faith of\r\nthe Catholic Church. It concerned the means of eternal salvation. The\r\nChurch taught, as we have seen, that she possessed the sole means, and\r\nthat every Christian must perform certain \"good works\" in order to\r\nsecure salvation. Luther, on the other hand, became convinced that man\r\nwas incapable, in the sight of God, of any good works whatsoever, and\r\ncould be saved only by faith in God's promises. In other words, this\r\nmonk placed his doctrine of \"justification by faith\" in opposition to\r\nthe generally accepted belief in \"justification by faith and works.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tetzel's \"Sale\" of Indulgences]\r\n\r\nSo far, Luther certainly had no thought of revolting against the\r\nauthority of the Church. In fact, when he visited Rome in 1511, it was\r\nas a pious pilgrim rather than as a carping critic. But a significant\r\nevent in the year 1517 served to make clear a wide discrepancy between\r\nwhat he was teaching and what the Church taught. That year a certain\r\npapal agent, Tetzel by name, was disposing of indulgences in the great\r\narchbishopric of Mainz. An indulgence, according to Catholic theology,\r\nwas a remission of the temporal punishment in purgatory due to sin, and\r\ncould be granted only by authority of the Church; the grant of\r\nindulgences depended upon the contrition and confession of the\r\napplicant, and often at that time upon money-payments. Against what he\r\nbelieved was a corruption of Christian doctrine and a swindling of the\r\npoorer people, Luther protested in a series of ninety-five Theses which\r\nhe posted on the church door in Wittenberg (31 October, 1517).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ninety-five Theses]\r\n\r\nThe Theses had been written in Latin for the educated class but they\r\nwere now speedily translated into German and spread like wildfire among\r\nall classes throughout the country. Luther's underlying principle of\r\n\"salvation through simple faith\" was in sharp contrast with the theory\r\nof \"good works,\" on which the indulgences rested. \"The Christian who\r\nhas true repentance,\" wrote Luther, \"has already received pardon from\r\nGod altogether apart from an indulgence, and does not need one; Christ\r\ndemands this true repentance from every one.\" Luther's attitude\r\nprovoked spirited discussion throughout the Germanics, and the more\r\ndiscussion, the more interest and excitement. The pope, who had\r\ndismissed the subject at first as a mere squabble among the monks, was\r\nmoved at length to summon Luther to Rome to answer for the Theses, but\r\nthe elector of Saxony intervened and prevailed upon the pope not to\r\npress the matter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disputation at Leipzig, 1519]\r\n\r\nThe next important step in the development of Luther's religious ideas\r\nwas a debate on the general question of papal supremacy, held at\r\nLeipzig in 1519, between himself and an eminent Catholic apologist,\r\nJohann Eck. Eck skillfully forced Luther to admit that certain views of\r\nhis, especially those concerning man's direct relation with God,\r\nwithout the mediation of the Church, were the same as those which John\r\nHus had held a century earlier and which had been condemned both by the\r\npope and by the great general council of Constance. Luther thereby\r\nvirtually admitted that a general council as well as a pope might err.\r\nFor him, the divine authority of the Roman Catholic Church ceased to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Separation of Luther from the Catholic Church]\r\n\r\nSeparation from the traditional Church was the only course now open to\r\nLuther and this was consummated in the year 1520. In a series of three\r\nbold pamphlets, he vigorously and definitely attacked the position of\r\nthe Church. In the first--_An Address to the Nobility of the German\r\nNation_--Luther stated that there was nothing inherently sacred\r\nabout the Christian priesthood and that the clergy should be deprived\r\nimmediately of their special privileges; he urged the German princes to\r\nfree their country from foreign control and shrewdly called their\r\nattention to the wealth and power of the Church which they might justly\r\nappropriate to themselves. In the second--_On the Babylonian\r\nCaptivity of the Church of God_--he assailed the papacy and the\r\nwhole sacramental system. The third--_On the Freedom of a Christian\r\nMan_--contained the essence of Luther's new theology that salvation\r\nwas not a painful _progress_ toward a goal by means of sacraments\r\nand right conduct but a _condition_ \"in which man found himself so\r\nsoon as he despaired absolutely of his own efforts and threw himself on\r\nGod's assurances\"; the author claimed that man's utter personal\r\ndependence on God's grace rendered the system of the Church\r\nsuperfluous.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these attacks upon the Church, the pope excommunicated\r\nLuther, and in the following year (1521) influenced the Diet of the\r\nHoly Roman Empire, assembled at Worms, to pronounce him an outlaw. But\r\nthe rebel calmly burnt the papal bull and from the imperial ban he was\r\nprotected by the elector of Saxony. He at once devoted himself to\r\nmaking a new German translation of the Bible, which became very popular\r\nand is still prized as a monument in the history of German literature.\r\n[Footnote: The first edition of the Bible in German had been printed as\r\nearly as 1466. At least eighteen editions in German (including four Low\r\nGerman versions) had appeared before Luther issued his German New\r\nTestament in 1522.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spread of Lutheranism]\r\n\r\nWithin the next few years the Lutheran teachings carried everything\r\nbefore them throughout the northern and central Germanies. Nor are the\r\nreasons for Luther's success in defying pope and emperor and for the\r\nrapid acceptance of his new theology hard to understand. The movement\r\nwas essentially popular and national. It appealed to the pious-minded\r\nwho desired a simplification of Christian dogma and a comprehensible\r\nmethod of salvation. It also appealed to the worldly minded who longed\r\nto seize ecclesiastical lands and revenues. Above all, it appealed to\r\nthe patriots who were tired of foreign despotism and of abuses which\r\nthey traced directly to the Roman Curia. Then, too, the Emperor Charles\r\nV, who remained a loyal Catholic, was too immersed in the difficulties\r\nof foreign war and in the manifold administrative problems of his huge\r\ndominions to be able to devote much time to the extirpation of heresy\r\nin the Germanies. Finally, the character of Luther contributed to\r\neffective leadership--he was tireless in flooding the country with\r\npamphlets, letters, and inflammatory diatribes, tactful in keeping his\r\nparty together, and always bold and courageous. Princes, burghers,\r\nartisans, and peasants joined hands in espousing the new cause.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Luther and the German Peasants]\r\n\r\nBut the peasants espoused it in a manner altogether too logical and too\r\nviolent to suit Luther or the desires of the princes. The German\r\npeasants had grievances against the old order compared with which those\r\nof the knights and towns-folk were imaginary. For at least a century\r\nseveral causes had contributed to make their lot worse and worse. While\r\ntheir taxes and other burdens were increasing, the ability of the\r\nemperor to protect them was decreasing; they were plundered by every\r\nclass in the community, especially by the higher clergy. Thus, under\r\nthe influence of social and economic conditions, various uprisings of\r\nthe peasants had taken place during the latter part of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. These insurrections became almost regular in the southwestern\r\nGermanies, and were called _Bundschuhe_, a shoe fastened upon the\r\nend of a pole serving as a standard of revolt. When Luther urged the\r\nprinces to assail the ecclesiastics, to seize church lands, and to put\r\nan end to financial abuses, the peasants naturally listened to his\r\nwords with open ears and proceeded with glad hearts to apply his advice\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe new Lutheran theology may have been too refined for the peasants,\r\nbut they imagined they understood its purport. And spurred on by\r\nfanatics, whom the religious ferment of the times produced in large\r\nnumbers, [Footnote: Many of these radical religious leaders were more\r\nconsistent and thoroughgoing than Luther in maintaining the right of\r\neach Christian to interpret the Scriptures for himself. Since they\r\ngenerally refused to recognize infant baptism as valid and insisted\r\nthat baptism should be administered only to adults, they were\r\nsubsequently often referred to as \"Anabaptists.\" Many of the\r\n\"Anabaptists\" condemned oaths and capital punishment; some advocated\r\ncommunism of worldly goods, in several instances even the community of\r\nwomen. Nicholas Storch (d. 1525), a weaver, and Thomas Munzer (d.\r\n1525), a Lutheran preacher, spread these doctrines widely among the\r\npeasants. Luther vehemently denounced the \"Anabaptists.\"] the peasants\r\nagain took arms against feudal oppression. That the peasants' demands\r\nwere essentially moderate and involved no more than is granted\r\neverywhere to-day as a matter of course, may be inferred from their\r\ndeclaration of principles, the Twelve Articles, among which were:\r\nabolition of serfdom, free right of fishing and hunting, payment in\r\nwages for services rendered, and abolition of arbitrary punishment. So\r\nlong as the peasants directed their efforts against the Catholic\r\necclesiastics, Luther expressed sympathy with them, but when the\r\nrevolt, which broke out in 1524, became general all over central and\r\nsouthern Germany and was directed not only against the Catholic clergy\r\nbut also against the lay lords,--many of whom were now Lutheran,--the\r\nreligious leader foresaw a grave danger to his new religion in a split\r\nbetween peasants and nobles. Luther ended by taking strong sides with\r\nthe nobles--he had most to expect from them. He was shocked by the\r\nexcesses of the revolt, he said. Insisting upon toleration for his own\r\nrevolt, he condemned the peasants to most horrible fates in this world\r\nand in the world hereafter. [Footnote: Although Luther was particularly\r\nbitter against the \"Anabaptist\" exhorters, upon whom he fastened\r\nresponsibility for the Peasants' Revolt, and although many of them met\r\ndeath thereby, the \"Anabaptists\" were by no means exterminated.\r\nLargely through the activity of a certain Melchior Hofmann, a widely\r\ntraveled furrier, \"Anabaptist\" doctrines were disseminated in northern\r\nGermany and the Netherlands.  From 1533 to 1535 they reigned supreme,\r\nattended by much bloodshed and plenty of personal license, in the\r\nimportant city of Munster in western Germany. Subsequently, Carlstadt\r\n(1480-1541), an early associate of Luther, though his later antagonist,\r\nset forth Anabaptist views with greater moderation; and in course of\r\ntime the sect became more or less tinged with Calvinistic theology.] He\r\nfuriously begged the princes to put down the insurrection. \"Whoever\r\ncan, should smite, strangle, or stab, secretly or publicly!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Peasants' Revolt]\r\n\r\nThe Peasants' Revolt was crushed in 1525 with utmost cruelty. Probably\r\nfifty thousand lost their lives in the vain effort. The general result\r\nwas that the power of the territorial lords became greater than ever,\r\nalthough in a few cases, particularly in the Tyrol and in Baden, the\r\ncondition of the peasants was slightly improved. Elsewhere, however,\r\nthis was not the case; and the German peasants were assigned for over\r\ntwo centuries to a lot worse than that of almost any people in Europe.\r\nAnother result was the decline of Luther's influence among the\r\npeasantry in southern and central Germany. They turned rapidly from one\r\nwho, they believed, had betrayed them. On the other hand, many Catholic\r\nprinces, who had been wavering in their religious support, now had\r\nbefore their eyes what they thought was an object lesson of the results\r\nof Luther's appeal to revolution, and so they cast their lot decisively\r\nwith the ancient Church. The Peasants' Revolt registered a distinct\r\ncheck to the further spread of Lutheranism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diets of Speyer 1526, 1529]\r\n[Sidenote: The Word \"Protestant\"]\r\n\r\nThe Diet of the Holy Roman Empire which assembled at Speyer in 1526 saw\r\nthe German princes divided into a Lutheran and a Roman Catholic party,\r\nbut left the legal status of the new faith still in doubt, contenting\r\nitself with the vague declaration that \"each prince should so conduct\r\nhimself as he could answer for his behavior to God and to the emperor.\"\r\nBut at the next Diet, held at the same place in 1529, the emperor\r\ndirected that the edict against heretics should be enforced and that\r\nthe old ecclesiastical revenues should not be appropriated for the new\r\nworship. The Lutheran princes drafted a legal protest, in which they\r\ndeclared that they meant to abide by the law of 1526. From this protest\r\ncame the name _Protestant_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Confession of Augsburg, 1530]\r\n\r\nThe next year, Luther's great friend, Melancthon, presented to the Diet\r\nof Augsburg an account of the beliefs of the German reformers, which\r\nlater became known as the Confession of Augsburg and constitutes to the\r\npresent day the distinctive creed of the Lutheran Church. The emperor\r\nwas still unconvinced, however, of the truth or value of the reformed\r\ndoctrine, and declared his intention of ending the heresy by force of\r\narms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Religious Peace of Augsburg, 1555]\r\n\r\nIn this predicament, the Lutheran princes formed a league at Schmalkald\r\nfor mutual protection (1531); and from 1546 to 1555 a desultory civil\r\nwar was waged. The Protestants received some assistance from the French\r\nking, who, for political reasons, was bent on humiliating the emperor.\r\nThe end of the religious conflict appeared to have been reached by the\r\npeace of Augsburg (1555), which contained the following provisions: (1)\r\nEach prince was to be free to dictate the religion of his subjects\r\n[Footnote: _Cuius regio eius religio_.]; (2) All church property\r\nappropriated by the Protestants before 1552 was to remain in their\r\nhands; (3) No form of Protestantism except Lutheranism was to be\r\ntolerated; (4) Lutheran subjects of ecclesiastical states were not to\r\nbe obliged to renounce their faith; (5) By an \"ecclesiastical\r\nreservation\" any ecclesiastical prince on becoming a Protestant was to\r\ngive up his see.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lutheranism in the Germanies]\r\n\r\nThus, between 1520 and 1555, Martin Luther [Footnote: He died in 1546,\r\naged 62.] had preached his new theology at variance with the Catholic,\r\nand had found general acceptance for it throughout the northern half of\r\nthe Germanies; its creed had been settled and defined in 1530, and its\r\nofficial toleration had been recognized in 1555. The toleration was\r\nlimited, however, to princes, and for many years Lutheran rulers showed\r\nthemselves quite as intolerant within their own dominions as did the\r\nCatholics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lutheranism in Scandinavia]\r\n\r\nThe triumph of Lutheranism in the Scandinavian countries has been\r\ntraced largely to political and economic causes. When Martin Luther\r\nbroke with the Catholic Church, Christian II (1513-1523) was reigning\r\nas elected king over Denmark and Norway and had recently conquered\r\nSweden by force of arms. The king encountered political difficulties\r\nwith the Church although he maintained Catholic worship and doctrine\r\nand apparently recognized the spiritual supremacy of the pope. But\r\nChristian II had trouble with most of his subjects, especially the\r\nSwedes, who were conscious of separate nationality and desirous of\r\npolitical independence; and the king eventually lost his throne in a\r\ngeneral uprising. The definite separation of Sweden from Denmark and\r\nNorway followed immediately. The Swedes chose the celebrated Gustavus\r\nVasa (1523-1560) as their king, while the Danish and Norwegian crowns\r\npassed to the uncle of Christian II, who assumed the title of Frederick\r\nI (1523-1533).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Denmark]\r\n\r\nIn Denmark, King Frederick was very desirous of increasing the royal\r\npower, and the subservient ecclesiastical organization which Martin\r\nLuther was advocating seemed to him for his purposes infinitely\r\npreferable to the ancient self-willed Church. But Frederick realized\r\nthat the Catholic Church was deeply rooted in the affections of his\r\npeople and that changes would have to be effected slowly and\r\ncautiously. He therefore collected around him Lutheran teachers from\r\nGermany and made his court the center of the propaganda of the new\r\ndoctrine, and so well was the work of the new teachers done that the\r\nking was able in 1527 to put the two religions on an equal footing\r\nbefore the law. Upon Frederick's death in 1533, the Catholics made a\r\ndetermined effort to prevent the accession of his son, Christian III,\r\nwho was not only an avowed Lutheran but was known to stand for\r\nabsolutist principles in government.\r\n\r\nThe popular protest against royal despotism failed in Denmark and the\r\ntriumph of Christian III in 1536 sealed the fate of Catholicism in that\r\ncountry and in Norway. It was promptly enacted that the Catholic\r\nbishops should forfeit their temporal and spiritual authority and all\r\ntheir property should be transferred to the crown \"for the good of the\r\ncommonwealth.\" After discussions with Luther the new religion was\r\ndefinitely organized and declared the state religion in 1537. It might\r\nbe added that Catholicism died with difficulty in Denmark,--many\r\npeasants as well as high churchmen resented the changes, and Helgesen,\r\nthe foremost Scandinavian scholar and humanist of the time, protested\r\nvigorously against the new order. But the crown was growing powerful,\r\nand the crown prevailed. The enormous increase of royal revenue,\r\nconsequent upon the confiscation of the property of the Church, enabled\r\nthe king to make Denmark the leading Scandinavian country throughout\r\nthe second half of the sixteenth century and the first quarter of the\r\nseventeenth. In time national patriotism came to be intertwined with\r\nLutheranism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sweden]\r\n\r\nIn Sweden the success of the new religion was due to the crown quite as\r\nmuch as in Denmark and Norway. Gustavus Vasa had obtained the Swedish\r\nthrone through the efforts of a nationalist party, but there was still\r\na hostile faction, headed by the chief churchman, the archbishop of\r\nUpsala, who favored the maintenance of the union with Denmark. In order\r\nto deprive the unionists of their leader, Gustavus begged the pope to\r\nremove the rebellious archbishop and to appoint one in sympathy with\r\nthe nationalist cause. This the pope peremptorily refused to do, and\r\nthe breach with Rome began. Gustavus succeeded in suppressing the\r\ninsurrection, and then persevered in introducing Protestantism. The\r\nintroduction was very gradual, especially among the peasantry, and its\r\neventual success was largely the result of the work of one strong man\r\nassisted by a subservient parliament.\r\n\r\nAt first Gustavus maintained Catholic worship and doctrines, contenting\r\nhimself with the suppression of the monasteries, the seizure of two-\r\nthirds of the church tithes, and the circulation of a popular Swedish\r\ntranslation of the New Testament. In 1527 all ecclesiastical property\r\nwas transferred to the crown and two Catholic bishops were cruelly put\r\nto death. Meanwhile Lutheran teachers were encouraged to take up their\r\nresidence in Sweden and in 1531 the first Protestant archbishop of\r\nUpsala was chosen. Thenceforth, the progress of Lutheranism was more\r\nrapid, although a Catholic reaction was threatened several times in the\r\nsecond half of the sixteenth century. The Confession of Augsburg was\r\nadopted as the creed of the Swedish Church in 1593, and in 1604\r\nCatholics were deprived of offices and estates and banished from the\r\nrealm.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALVINISM\r\n\r\nThe second general type of Protestantism which appeared in the\r\nsixteenth century was the immediate forerunner of the modern\r\nPresbyterian, Congregational, and Reformed Churches and at one time or\r\nanother considerably affected the theology of the Episcopalians and\r\nBaptists and even of Lutherans. Taken as a group, it is usually called\r\nCalvinism. Of its rise and spread, some idea may be gained from brief\r\naccounts of the lives of two of its great apostles--Calvin and Knox.\r\nBut first it will be necessary to say a few words concerning an older\r\nreformer, Zwingli by name, who prepared the way for Calvin's work in\r\nthe Swiss cantons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Zwingli]\r\n\r\nSwitzerland comprised in the sixteenth century some thirteen cantons,\r\nall of which were technically under the suzerainty of the Holy Roman\r\nEmpire, but constituted in practice so many independent republics,\r\nbound together only by a number of protective treaties. To the town of\r\nEinsiedeln in the canton of Schwyz came Huldreich Zwingli in the year\r\n1516 as a Catholic priest. Slightly younger than Luther, he was well\r\nborn, had received an excellent university education in Vienna and in\r\nBasel, and had now been in holy orders about ten years. He had shown\r\nfor some time more interest in humanism than in the old-fashioned\r\ntheology, but hardly any one would have suspected him of heresy, for it\r\nwas well known that he was a regular pensioner of the pope.\r\n\r\nZwingli's opposition to the Roman Church seems to have been based at\r\nfirst largely on political grounds. He preached eloquently against the\r\npractice of hiring out Swiss troops to foreign rulers and abused the\r\nChurch for its share in this shameless traffic in soldiers. Then he was\r\nled on to attack all manner of abuses in ecclesiastical organization,\r\nbut it was not until he was installed in 1518 as preacher in the great\r\ncathedral at Zürich that he clearly denied papal supremacy and\r\nproceeded to proclaim the Scriptures as the sole guide of faith and\r\nmorals. He preached against fasting, the veneration of saints, and the\r\ncelibacy of the clergy. Some of his hearers began to put his teachings\r\ninto practice: church edifices were profaned, statues demolished,\r\nwindows smashed, and relics burned. Zwingli himself took a wife.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Zwinglian Revolt in Switzerland]\r\n\r\nIn 1523 a papal appeal to Zürich to abandon Zwingli was answered by the\r\ncanton's formal declaration of independence from the Catholic Church.\r\nHenceforth the revolt spread rapidly throughout Switzerland, except in\r\nthe five forest cantons, the very heart of the country, where the\r\nancient religion was still deeply intrenched. Serious efforts were made\r\nto join the followers of Zwingli with those of Luther, and thus to\r\npresent a united front to the common enemy, but there seemed to be\r\nirreconcilable differences between Lutheranism and the views of\r\nZwingli. The latter, which were succinctly expressed in sixty-seven\r\nTheses published at Zürich in 1523, insisted more firmly than the\r\nformer on the supreme authority of Scripture, and broke more thoroughly\r\nand radically with the traditions of the Catholic Church. Zwingli aimed\r\nat a reformation of government and discipline as well as of theology,\r\nand entertained a notion of an ideal state in which the democracy would\r\norder human activities, whether political or religious. Zwingli\r\ndiffered essentially from Luther in never distrusting \"the people.\"\r\nPerhaps the most distinctive mark of the Swiss reformer's theology was\r\nhis idea that the Lord's Supper is not a miracle but simply a symbol\r\nand a memorial.\r\n\r\nIn 1531 Zwingli urged the Protestant Swiss to convert the five forest\r\ncantons to the new religion by force of arms. In answer to his\r\nentreaties, civil war ensued, but the Catholic mountaineers won a great\r\nvictory that very year and the reformer himself was killed. A truce was\r\nthen arranged, the provisions of which foreshadowed the religious\r\nsettlement in the Germanies--each canton was to be free to determine\r\nits own religion. Switzerland has remained to this day part Catholic\r\nand part Protestant.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calvin]\r\n\r\nBy the sudden death of Zwingli, Swiss Protestantism was left without a\r\nleader, but not for long, because the more celebrated Calvin took up\r\nhis residence in Geneva in 1536. From that time until his death in 1564\r\nCalvin was the center of a movement which, starting from these small\r\nZwinglian beginnings among the Swiss mountains, speedily spread over\r\nmore countries and affected more people than did Lutheranism. In\r\nCalvinism, Catholicism was to find her most implacable foe.\r\n\r\nJohn Calvin, who, next to Martin Luther, was the most conspicuous\r\nProtestant leader of the sixteenth century, was a Frenchman. Born of\r\nmiddle-class parentage at Noyon in the province of Picardy in 1509, he\r\nwas intended from an early age for an ecclesiastical career. A pension\r\nfrom the Catholic Church enabled him to study at Paris, where he\r\ndisplayed an aptitude for theology and literature. When he was nineteen\r\nyears of age, however, his father advised him to abandon the idea of\r\nentering the priesthood in favor of becoming a lawyer--so young Calvin\r\nspent several years studying law.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calvin in France]\r\n\r\nIt was in 1529 that Calvin is said to have experienced a sudden\r\n\"conversion.\" Although as yet there had been no organized revolt in\r\nFrance against the Catholic Church, that country, like many others, was\r\nteeming with religious critics. Thousands of Frenchmen were in sympathy\r\nwith any attempt to improve the Church by education, by purer morals,\r\nor by better preaching. Lutheranism was winning a few converts, and\r\nvarious evangelical sects were appearing in divers places. The chief\r\nproblem was whether reform should be sought within the traditional\r\nChurch or by rebellion against it. Calvin believed that his conversion\r\nwas a divine call to forsake Roman Catholicism and to become the\r\napostle of a purer life. His heart, he said, was \"so subdued and\r\nreduced to docility that in comparison with his zeal for true piety he\r\nregarded all other studies with indifference, though not entirely\r\nabandoning them. Though himself a beginner, many flocked to him to\r\nlearn the pure doctrine, and he began to seek some hiding-place and\r\nmeans of withdrawal from people.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The Institutes\"]\r\n\r\nHis search for a hiding-place was quickened by the announced\r\ndetermination of the French king, Francis I, to put an end to religious\r\ndissent among his subjects. Calvin abruptly left France and found an\r\nasylum in the Swiss town of Basel, where he became acquainted at first\r\nhand with the type of reformed religion which Zwingli had propagated\r\nand where he proceeded to write a full account of the Protestant\r\nposition as contrasted with the Catholic. This exposition,--_The\r\nInstitutes of the Christian Religion_,--which was published in 1536,\r\nwas dedicated to King Francis I and was intended to influence him in\r\nfavor of Protestantism.\r\n\r\nAlthough the book failed of its immediate purpose, it speedily won a\r\ndeservedly great reputation. It was a statement of Calvin's views,\r\nborrowed in part from Zwingli, and in part from Luther and other\r\nreformers. It was orderly and concise, and it did for Protestant\r\ntheology what the medieval writers had done for Catholic theology. It\r\ncontained the germ of all that subsequently developed as Calvinism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calvin and Luther]\r\n\r\nIt seemed for some time as if the _Institutes_ might provide a\r\ncommon religious rule and guide for all Christians who rebelled against\r\nRome. But Calvin, in mind and nature, was quite different from Luther.\r\nThe latter was impetuous, excitable, but very human; the former was\r\nascetic, calm, and inhumanly logical. Then, too, Luther was quite\r\nwilling to leave everything in the church which was not prohibited by\r\nScripture; Calvin insisted that nothing should remain in the church\r\nwhich was not expressly authorized by Scripture. The _Institutes_\r\nhad a tremendous influence upon Protestantism but did not unite the\r\nfollowers of Calvin and Luther. Calvin's book seems all the more\r\nwonderful, when it is recalled that it was written when the author was\r\nbut twenty-six years of age.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calvin at Geneva]\r\n\r\nIn 1536 Calvin went to Geneva, which was then in the throes of a\r\nrevolution at once political and religious, for the townsfolk were\r\nfreeing themselves from the feudal suzerainty of the duke of Savoy and\r\nbanishing the Catholic Church, whose cause the duke championed. Calvin\r\naided in the work and was rewarded by an appointment as chief pastor\r\nand preacher in the city. This position he continued to hold, except\r\nfor a brief period when he was exiled, until his death in 1564. It\r\nproved to be a commanding position not only in ordering the affairs of\r\nthe town, but also in giving form to an important branch of Protestant\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\nThe government of Geneva under Calvin's regime was a curious theocracy\r\nof which Calvin himself was both religious leader and political \"boss.\"\r\nThe minister of the reformed faith became God's mouthpiece upon earth\r\nand inculcated an unbending puritanism in daily life. \"No more\r\nfestivals, no more jovial reunions, no more theaters or society; the\r\nrigid monotony of an austere rule weighed upon life. A poet was\r\ndecapitated because of his verses; Calvin wished adultery to be\r\npunished by death like heresy, and he had Michael Servetus [Footnote: A\r\ncelebrated Spanish reformer.] burned for not entertaining the same\r\nopinions as himself upon the mystery of the Trinity.\"\r\n\r\nUnder Calvin's theocratic despotism, Geneva became famous throughout\r\nEurope as the center of elaborate Protestant propaganda. Calvin, who\r\nset the example of stern simplicity and relentless activity, was\r\nsometimes styled the Protestant pope. He not only preached every day,\r\nwrote numerous theological treatises, and issued a French translation\r\nof the Bible, but he established important Protestant schools--\r\nincluding the University of Geneva--which attracted students from\r\ndistant lands, and he conducted a correspondence with his disciples and\r\nwould-be reformers in all points of Europe. His letters alone would\r\nfill thirty folio volumes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diffusion of Calvinism]\r\n\r\nSuch activities account for the almost bewildering diffusion of\r\nCalvinism. French, Dutch, Germans, Scotch, and English flocked to\r\nGeneva to hear Calvin or to attend his schools, and when they returned\r\nto their own countries they were likely to be so many glowing sparks\r\nready to start mighty conflagrations.\r\n\r\nCalvinism was known by various names in the different countries which\r\nit entered. On the continent of Europe it was called the Reformed\r\nFaith, and in France its followers were styled Huguenots; in Scotland\r\nit became Presbyterianism; and in England, Puritanism. Its essential\r\ncharacteristics, however, remained the same wherever it was carried.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calvinism in Switzerland]\r\n\r\nWe have already noticed how Switzerland, except for the five forest\r\ncantons, had been converted to Protestantism by the preaching of\r\nZwingli. Calvin was Zwingli's real theological successor, and the\r\nmajority of the Swiss, especially those in the urban cantons of Zürich\r\nand Bern as well as of Geneva, cheerfully accepted Calvinism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calvinism in France: the Huguenots]\r\n\r\nCalvinism also made converts in France. The doctrines and writings of\r\nLuther had there encountered small success. Many French reformers\r\nbelieved that greater good would eventually be achieved within the\r\nCatholic Church than without. There appeared to be fewer abuses among\r\nthe French clergy than among the ecclesiastics of northern Europe, for\r\nthey possessed less wealth and power. The French sovereign felt less\r\nprompted to lay his hand upon the dominions of the clergy, because a\r\nspecial agreement with the pope in 1516 bestowed upon the king the\r\nnomination of bishops and the disposition of benefices. For these\r\nreasons the bulk of the French people resisted Protestantism of every\r\nform and remained loyally Catholic.\r\n\r\nWhat progress the new religion made in France was due to Calvin rather\r\nthan to Luther. Calvin, as we have seen, was a Frenchman himself, and\r\nhis teachings and logic appealed to a small but influential body of his\r\nfellow-countrymen. A considerable portion of the lower nobility, a few\r\nmerchants and business men, and many magistrates conformed to Calvinism\r\nopenly; the majority of great lawyers and men of learning adhered to it\r\nin public or in secret. Probably from a twentieth to a thirtieth of the\r\ntotal population embraced Calvinism. The movement was essentially\r\nconfined to the middle-class or _bourgeoisie_, and almost from the\r\noutset it acquired a political as well as a religious significance. It\r\nrepresented among the lesser nobility an awakening of the aristocratic\r\nspirit and among the middle-class a reaction against the growing power\r\nof the king. The financial and moneyed interests of the country were\r\nlargely attracted to French Calvinism. The Huguenots, as the French\r\nCalvinists were called, were particularly strong in the law courts and\r\nin the Estates-General or parliament, and these had been the main\r\nchecks upon royal despotism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edict of Nantes]\r\n\r\nThe Huguenots were involved in sanguinary civil and religious wars\r\nwhich raged in France throughout the greater part of the sixteenth\r\ncentury and which have already been treated in their appropriate\r\npolitical aspect. The outcome was the settlement accorded by King Henry\r\nIV in the famous Edict of Nantes (1598), which contained the following\r\nprovisions: (1) Private worship and liberty of conscience were allowed\r\nto the Calvinists throughout France; (2) Public Protestant worship\r\nmight be held in 200 enumerated towns and over 3000 castles; (3) A\r\nfinancial grant was made to Protestant schools, and the publication of\r\nCalvinist books was legalized; (4) Huguenots received full civil\r\nrights, with admission to all public offices; (5) Huguenots were\r\ngranted for eight years the political control of two hundred towns, the\r\ngarrisons of which were to be maintained by the crown; and (6)\r\nHuguenots were accorded certain judicial privileges and the right of\r\nholding religious and political assemblies. For nearly a hundred years\r\nFrance practiced a religious toleration which was almost unique among\r\nEuropean nations, and it was Calvinists who benefited.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calvinism in the Netherlands]\r\n\r\nThe Netherlands were too near the Germanies not to be affected by the\r\nLutheran revolt against the Catholic Church. And the northern or Dutch\r\nprovinces became quite thoroughly saturated with Lutheranism and also\r\nwith the doctrines of various radical sects that from time to time were\r\nexpelled from the German states. The Emperor Charles V tried to stamp\r\nout heresy by harsh action of the Inquisition, but succeeded only in\r\nchanging its name and nature. Lutheranism disappeared from the\r\nNetherlands; but in its place came Calvinism, [Footnote: Many\r\nAnabaptist refugees from Germany had already sought refuge in the\r\nNetherlands: they naturally found the teachings of Zwingli and Calvin\r\nmore radical, and therefore more appropriate to themselves, than the\r\nteachings of Luther. This fact also serves to explain the acceptance of\r\nCalvinism in regions of southern Germany where Lutheranism, since the\r\nPeasants' Revolt, had failed to take root.] descending from Geneva\r\nthrough Alsace and thence down the Rhine, or entering from Great\r\nBritain by means of the close commercial relations existing between\r\nthose countries. While the southern Netherlands eventually were\r\nrecovered for Catholicism, the protracted political and economic\r\nconflict which the northern Netherlands waged against the Catholic king\r\nof Spain contributed to a final fixing of Calvinism as the national\r\nreligion of patriotic Dutchmen. Calvinism in Holland was known as the\r\nDutch Reformed religion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calvinism in Southern Germany]\r\n\r\nWe have already noted that southern Germany had rejected aristocratic\r\nLutheranism, partially at least because of Luther's bitter words to the\r\npeasants. Catholicism, however, was not destined to have complete sway\r\nin those regions, for democratic Calvinism permeated Württemberg,\r\nBaden, and the Rhenish provinces, and the Reformed doctrines gained\r\nnumerous converts among the middle-class. The growth of Calvinism in\r\nGermany was seriously handicapped by the religious settlement of\r\nAugsburg in 1555 which officially tolerated only Catholicism and\r\nLutheranism. It was not until after the close of the direful Thirty\r\nYears' War in the seventeenth century that German Calvinists received\r\nformal recognition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scotland]\r\n\r\nScotland, like every other European country in the early part of the\r\nsixteenth century, had been a place of protest against moral and\r\nfinancial abuses in the Catholic Church, but the beginnings of\r\necclesiastical rebellion are to be traced rather to political causes.\r\nThe kingdom had long been a prey to the bitter rivalry of great noble\r\nfamilies, and the premature death of James V (1542), which left the\r\nthrone to his ill-fated infant daughter, Mary Stuart, gave free rein to\r\na feudal reaction against the crown. In general, the Catholic clergy\r\nsided with the royal cause, while the religious reformers egged on the\r\nnobles to champion Protestantism in order to deal an effective blow\r\nagainst the union of the altar and the throne. Thus Cardinal Beaton,\r\nhead of the Catholic Church in Scotland, ordered numerous executions on\r\nthe score of protecting religion and the authority of the queen-regent;\r\non the other hand several noblemen, professing the new theology,\r\nassassinated the cardinal and hung his body on the battlements of the\r\ncastle of St. Andrews (1546). Such was the general situation in\r\nScotland when John Knox appeared upon the scene.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Knox]\r\n\r\nBorn of peasant parents about 1515, John Knox [Footnote: John Knox (c.\r\n1515-1572).] had become a Catholic priest, albeit in sympathy with many\r\nof the revolutionary ideas which were entering Scotland from the\r\nContinent and from England. In 1546 he openly rejected the authority of\r\nthe Church and proceeded to preach \"the Gospel\" and a stern puritanical\r\nmorality. \"Others snipped the branches,\" he said, \"he struck at the\r\nroot.\" But the Catholic court was able to banish Knox from Scotland.\r\nAfter romantic imprisonment in France, Knox spent a few years in\r\nEngland, preaching an extreme puritanism, holding a chaplaincy under\r\nEdward VI (1547-1553), and exerting his influence to insure an\r\nindelibly Protestant character to the Anglican Church. Then upon the\r\naccession to the English throne of the Catholic Mary Tudor, Knox betook\r\nhimself to Geneva where he made the acquaintance of Calvin and found\r\nhimself in essential agreement with the teachings of the French\r\nreformer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calvinism in Scotland]\r\n\r\nAfter a stay of some five years on the Continent, Knox returned finally\r\nto Scotland and became the organizer and director of the \"Lords of the\r\nCongregation,\" a league of the chief Protestant noblemen for purposes\r\nof religious propaganda and political power. In 1560 he drew up the\r\ncreed and discipline of the Presbyterian Church after the model of\r\nCalvin's church at Geneva; and in the same year with the support of the\r\n\"Lords of the Congregation\" and the troops of Queen Elizabeth of\r\nEngland, Knox effected a political and religious revolution in\r\nScotland. The queen-regent was imprisoned and the subservient\r\nparliament abolished the papal supremacy and enacted the death penalty\r\nagainst any one who should even attend Catholic worship. John Knox had\r\ncarried everything before him.\r\n\r\nMary Stuart, during her brief stay in Scotland (1561-1567), tried in\r\nvain to stem the tide. The jealous barons would brook no increase of\r\nroyal authority. The austere Knox hounded the girl-queen in public\r\nsermons and fairly flayed her character. The queen's downfall and\r\nsubsequent long imprisonment in England finally decided the\r\necclesiastical future of Scotland. Except in a few fastnesses in the\r\nnorthern highlands, where Catholicism survived among the clansmen, the\r\nwhole country was committed to Calvinism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calvinism in England]\r\n\r\nCalvinism was not without influence in England. Introduced towards the\r\nclose of the reign of Henry VIII, it gave rise to a number of small\r\nsects which troubled the king's Anglican Church almost as much as did\r\nthe Roman Catholics. Under Edward VI (1547-1553), it considerably\r\ninfluenced the theology of the Anglican Church itself, but the moderate\r\npolicies of Elizabeth (1558-1603) tended to fix an inseparable gulf\r\nbetween Anglicans and Calvinists. Thenceforth, Calvinism lived in\r\nEngland, in the forms of Presbyterianism, Independency, [Footnote:\r\nAmong the \"Independents\" were the Baptists, a sect related not so\r\nimmediately to Calvinism as to the radical Anabaptists of Germany. See\r\nabove, pp. 134 f., 145, footnotes] and Puritanism, as the religion\r\nlargely of the commercial middle class. It was treated with contempt,\r\nand even persecuted, by Anglicans, especially by the monarchs of the\r\nStuart family. After a complete but temporary triumph under Cromwell,\r\nin the seventeenth century, it was at length legally tolerated in\r\nEngland after the settlement of 1689. It was from England that New\r\nEngland received the Calvinistic religion which dominated colonial\r\nforefathers of many present-day Americans.\r\n\r\n\r\nANGLICANISM\r\n\r\nAnglicanism is the name frequently applied to that form of\r\nProtestantism which stamped the state church in England in the\r\nsixteenth century and which is now represented by the Episcopal Church\r\nin the United States as well as by the established Church of England.\r\nThe Methodist churches are comparatively late off-shoots of\r\nAnglicanism.\r\n\r\nThe separation of England from the papacy was a more gradual and\r\nhalting process than were the contemporary revolutions on the\r\nContinent; and the new Anglicanism was correspondingly more\r\nconservative than Lutheranism or Calvinism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English Catholicism in 1500]\r\n[Sidenote: Church of England]\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the sixteenth century, the word \"Catholic\" meant the\r\nsame in England as in every other country of western or central Europe\r\n--belief in the seven sacraments, the sacrifice of the Mass, and the\r\nveneration of saints; acceptance of papal supremacy and support of\r\nmonasticism and of other institutions and practices of the medieval\r\nChurch. During several centuries it had been customary in legal\r\ndocuments to refer to the Catholic Church in England as the _Ecclesia\r\nAnglicana_, or Anglican Church, just as the popes in their letters\r\nrepeatedly referred to the \"Gallican Church,\" the \"Spanish Church,\" the\r\n\"Neapolitan Church,\" or the \"Hungarian Church.\" But such phraseology\r\ndid not imply a separation of any one national church from the common\r\nCatholic communion, and for nearly a thousand years--ever since there\r\nhad been an _Ecclesia Anglicana_--the English had recognized the\r\nbishop of Rome as the center of Catholic unity. In the course of the\r\nsixteenth century, however, the great majority of Englishmen changed\r\ntheir conception of the _Ecclesia Anglicana_, so that to them it\r\ncontinued to exist as the Church of England, but henceforth on a\r\nstrictly national basis, in communion neither with the pope nor with\r\nthe Orthodox Church of the East nor with the Lutherans or Calvinists,\r\nabandoning several doctrines that had been universally held in earlier\r\ntimes and substituting in their place beliefs and customs which were\r\ndistinctively Protestant. This new conception of the Anglican Church--\r\nresulting from the revolution in the sixteenth century--is what we mean\r\nby Anglicanism as a form of Protestantism. It took shape in the\r\neventful years between 1520 and 1570.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Religious Opposition to the Roman Catholic Church in\r\nEngland]\r\n\r\nIn order to understand how this religious and ecclesiastical revolution\r\nwas effected in England, we must appreciate the various elements\r\ndistrustful of the Catholic Church in that country about the year 1525.\r\nIn the first place, the Lutheran teachings were infiltrating into the\r\ncountry. As early as 1521 a small group at Cambridge had become\r\ninterested in the new German theology, and thence the sect spread to\r\nOxford, London, and other intellectual centers. It found its early\r\nconverts chiefly among the lower clergy and the merchants of the large\r\ntowns, but for several years it was not numerous.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, there was the same feeling in England as we have\r\nalready noted throughout all Europe that the clergy needed reform in\r\nmorals and in manners. This view was shared not only by the\r\ncomparatively insignificant group of heretical Lutherans, but likewise\r\nby a large proportion of the leading men who accounted themselves\r\northodox members of the Catholic Church. The well-educated humanists\r\nwere especially eloquent in preaching reform. The writings of Erasmus\r\nhad great vogue in England. John Colet (1467?-1519), a famous dean of\r\nSt. Paul's cathedral in London, was a keen reformer who disapproved of\r\nauricular confession and of the celibacy of the clergy. Sir Thomas More\r\n(1478-1535), one of the greatest minds of the century, thought the\r\nmonks were lazy and indolent, and the whole body of churchmen in need\r\nof an intellectual betterment. But neither Colet nor More had any\r\nintention of breaking away from the Roman Church. To them, and to many\r\nlike them, reform could be secured best within the traditional\r\necclesiastical body.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political Opposition to the Roman Catholic Church in\r\nEngland]\r\n\r\nA third source of distrust of the Church was a purely political feeling\r\nagainst the papacy. As we have already seen, the English king and\r\nEnglish parliament on several earlier occasions had sought to restrict\r\nthe temporal and political jurisdiction of the pope in England, but\r\neach restriction had been imposed for political reasons and even then\r\nhad represented the will of the monarch rather than that of the nation.\r\nIn fact, the most striking limitations of the pope's political\r\njurisdiction in the kingdom had been enacted during the early stages of\r\nthe Hundred Years' War, when the papacy was under French influence, and\r\nhad served, therefore, indirectly as political weapons against the\r\nFrench king. Before that war was over, the operation of the statutes\r\nhad been relaxed, and for a century or more prior to 1525 little was\r\nheard of even a political feeling against the bishop of Rome.\r\n\r\nNevertheless an evolution in English government was in progress at that\r\nvery time, which was bound sooner or later to create friction with the\r\nHoly See. On one hand, a sense of nationalism and of patriotism had\r\nbeen steadily growing in England, and it was at variance with the older\r\ncosmopolitan idea of Catholicism. On the other hand, a great increase\r\nof royal power had appeared in the fifteenth century, notably after the\r\naccession of the Tudor family in 1485. Henry VII (1485-1509) had\r\nsubordinated to the crown both the nobility and the parliament, and the\r\npatriotic support of the middle class he had secured. And when his son,\r\nHenry VIII (1509-1547), came to the throne, the only serious obstacle\r\nwhich appeared to be left in the way of royal absolutism was the\r\nprivileged independence of the Catholic Church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early Loyalty of Henry VIII to the Roman Catholic Church]\r\n\r\nYet a number of years passed before Henry VIII laid violent hands upon\r\nthe Church. In the meanwhile, he proved himself a devoted Roman\r\nCatholic. He scented the new Lutheran heresy and sought speedily to\r\nexterminate it. He even wrote in 1521 with his own royal pen a bitter\r\narraignment of the new theology, and sent his book, which he called\r\n_The Defence of the Seven Sacraments_, with a delightful\r\ndedicatory epistle to the pope. For his prompt piety and filial\r\northodoxy, he received from the bishop of Rome the proud title of\r\n_Fidei Defensor_, or Defender of the Faith, a title which he\r\njealously bore until his death, and which his successors, the\r\nsovereigns of Great Britain, with like humor have continued to bear\r\never since. He seemed not even to question the pope's political claims.\r\nHe allied himself on several occasions with Leo X in the great game of\r\nEuropean politics. His chief minister and adviser in England for many\r\nyears was Thomas Wolsey, the most conspicuous ecclesiastic in his\r\nkingdom and a cardinal of the Roman Church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Marriage Difficulty of Henry VIII]\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it is difficult to see how the Anglican\r\nChurch would have immediately broken away from Catholic unity had it\r\nnot been for the peculiar marital troubles of Henry VIII. The king had\r\nbeen married eighteen years to Catherine of Aragon, and had been\r\npresented by her with six children (of whom only one daughter, the\r\nPrincess Mary, had survived), when one day he informed her that they\r\nhad been living all those years in mortal sin and that their union was\r\nnot true marriage. The queen could hardly be expected to agree with\r\nsuch a definition, and there ensued a legal suit between the royal\r\npair.\r\n\r\nTo Henry VIII the matter was really quite simple. Henry was tired of\r\nCatherine and wanted to get rid of her; he believed the queen could\r\nbear him no more children and yet he ardently desired a male heir;\r\nrumor reported that the susceptible king had recently been smitten by\r\nthe brilliant black eyes of a certain Anne Boleyn, a maid-in-waiting at\r\nthe court. The purpose of Henry was obvious; so was the means, he\r\nthought. For it had occurred to him that Catherine was his elder\r\nbrother's widow, and, therefore, had no right, by church law, to marry\r\nhim. To be sure, a papal dispensation had been obtained from Pope\r\nJulius II authorizing the marriage, but why not now obtain a revocation\r\nof that dispensation from the reigning Pope Clement VII? Thus the\r\nmarriage with Catherine could be declared null and void, and Henry\r\nwould be a bachelor, thirty-six years of age, free to wed some\r\nprincess, or haply Anne Boleyn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difficult Position of the Pope]\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt that Clement VII would like to do a favor for his\r\ngreat English champion, but two difficulties at once presented\r\nthemselves. It would be a most dangerous precedent for the pope to\r\nreverse the decision of one of his predecessors. Worse still, the\r\nEmperor Charles V, the nephew of Queen Catherine, took up cudgels in\r\nhis aunt's behalf and threatened Clement with dire penalties if he\r\nnullified the marriage. The pope complained truthfully that he was\r\nbetween the anvil and the hammer. There was little for him to do except\r\nto temporize and to delay decision as long as possible.\r\n\r\nThe protracted delay was very irritating to the impulsive English king,\r\nwho was now really in love with Anne Boleyn. Gradually Henry's former\r\neffusive loyalty to the Roman See gave way to a settled conviction of\r\nthe tyranny of the papal power, and there rushed to his mind the\r\nrecollection of efforts of earlier English rulers to restrict that\r\npower. A few salutary enactments against the Church might compel a\r\nfavorable decision from the pope.\r\n\r\nHenry VIII seriously opened his campaign against the Roman Church in\r\n1531, when he frightened the English clergy into paying a fine of over\r\nhalf a million dollars for violating an obsolete statute that had\r\nforbidden reception of papal legates without royal sanction, and in the\r\nsame year he forced the clergy to recognize himself as supreme head of\r\nthe Church \"as far as that is permitted by the law of Christ.\" His\r\nsubservient Parliament then empowered him to stop the payment of\r\nannates and to appoint the bishops without recourse to the papacy.\r\nWithout waiting longer for the papal decision, he had Cranmer, one of\r\nhis own creatures, whom he had just named archbishop of Canterbury,\r\ndeclare his marriage with Catherine null and void and his union with\r\nAnne Boleyn canonical and legal. Pope Clement VII thereupon handed down\r\nhis long-delayed decision favorable to Queen Catherine, and\r\nexcommunicated Henry VIII for adultery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Separation of England from the Roman Catholic Church: the\r\nAct of Supremacy]\r\n\r\nThe formal breach between England and Rome occurred in 1534. Parliament\r\npassed a series of laws, one of which declared the king to be the \"only\r\nsupreme head in earth of the Church of England,\" and others cut off all\r\ncommunication with the pope and inflicted the penalty of treason upon\r\nany one who should deny the king's ecclesiastical supremacy.\r\n\r\nOne step in the transition of the Church of England had now been taken.\r\nFor centuries its members had recognized the pope as their\r\necclesiastical head; henceforth they were to own the ecclesiastical\r\nheadship of their king. From the former Catholic standpoint, this might\r\nbe schism but it was not necessarily heresy. Yet Henry VIII encountered\r\nconsiderable opposition from the higher clergy, from the monks, and\r\nfrom many intellectual leaders, as well as from large numbers of the\r\nlower classes. A popular uprising--the Pilgrimage of Grace--was sternly\r\nsuppressed, and such men as the brilliant Sir Thomas More and John\r\nFisher, the aged and saintly bishop of Rochester, were beheaded because\r\nthey retained their former belief in papal supremacy. Tudor despotism\r\ntriumphed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Six Articles\"]\r\n\r\nThe breach with Rome naturally encouraged the Lutherans and other\r\nheretics to think that England was on the point of becoming Protestant,\r\nbut nothing was further from the king's mind. The assailant of Luther\r\nremained at least partially consistent. And the Six Articles (1539)\r\nreaffirmed the chief points in Catholic doctrine and practice and\r\nvisited dissenters with horrible punishment. While separating England\r\nfrom the papacy, Henry was firmly resolved to maintain every other\r\ntenet of the Catholic faith as he had received it. His middle-of-the-\r\nroad policy was enforced with much bloodshed. On one side, the Catholic\r\nwho denied the royal supremacy was beheaded; on the other, the\r\nProtestant who denied transubstantiation was burned! It has been\r\nestimated that during the reign of Henry VIII the number of capital\r\ncondemnations for politico-religious offenses ran into the thousands--\r\nan inquisition that in terror and bloodshed is comparable to that of\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Suppression of the Monasteries]\r\n\r\nIt was likewise during the reign of Henry VIII that one of the most\r\nimportant of all earlier Christian institutions--monasticism--came to\r\nan end in England. There were certainly grave abuses and scandals in\r\nsome of the monasteries which dotted the country, and a good deal of\r\npopular sentiment had been aroused against the institution. Then, too\r\nthe monks had generally opposed the royal pretensions to religious\r\ncontrol and remained loyal to the pope. But the deciding factor in the\r\nsuppression of the monasteries was undoubtedly economic. Henry, always\r\nin need of funds on account of his extravagances, appropriated part of\r\nthe confiscated property for the benefit of the crown, and the rest he\r\nastutely distributed as gigantic bribes to the upper classes of the\r\nlaity. The nobles who accepted the ecclesiastical wealth were thereby\r\ncommitted to the new anti-papal religious settlement in England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Protestantizing the Church of England: Edward VI]\r\n\r\nThe Church of England, separated from the papacy under Henry VIII,\r\nbecame Protestant under Edward VI (1547-1553). The young king's\r\nguardian tolerated all manner of reforming propaganda, and Calvinists\r\nas well as Lutherans preached their doctrines freely. Official articles\r\nof religion, which were drawn up for the Anglican Church, showed\r\nunmistakably Protestant influence. The Latin service books of the\r\nCatholic Church were translated into English, under Cranmer's auspices,\r\nand the edition of the _Book of Common Prayer_, published in 1552,\r\nmade clear that the Eucharist was no longer to be regarded as a\r\npropitiatory sacrifice: the names \"Holy Communion\" and \"Lord's Supper\"\r\nwere substituted for \"Mass,\" while the word \"altar\" was replaced by\r\n\"table.\" The old places of Catholic worship were changed to suit a new\r\norder: altars and images were taken down, the former service books\r\ndestroyed, and stained-glass windows broken. Several peasant uprisings\r\nsignified that the nation was not completely united upon a policy of\r\nreligious change, but the reformers had their way, and Protestantism\r\nadvanced.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Temporary Roman Catholic Revival under Mary Tudor]\r\n\r\nA temporary setback to the progress of the new Anglicanism was afforded\r\nby the reign of Mary Tudor (1553-1558), the daughter of Catherine of\r\nAragon, and a devout Roman Catholic. She reinstated the bishops who had\r\nrefused to take the oath of royal supremacy and punished those who had\r\ntaken it. She prevailed upon Parliament to repeal the ecclesiastical\r\nlegislation of both her father's and her brother's reigns and to\r\nreconcile England once more with the bishop of Rome. A papal legate, in\r\nthe person of Cardinal Reginald Pole, sailed up the Thames with his\r\ncross gleaming from the prow of his barge, and in full Parliament\r\nadministered the absolution which freed the kingdom from the guilt\r\nunder Mary incurred by its schism and heresy. As an additional support\r\nto her policy of restoring the Catholic Church in England, Queen Mary\r\nmarried her cousin, Philip II of Spain, the great champion of\r\nCatholicism upon the Continent.\r\n\r\nBut events proved that despite outward appearances even the reign of\r\nMary registered an advance of Protestantism. The new doctrines were\r\nzealously propagated by an ever-growing number of itinerant exhorters.\r\nThe Spanish alliance was disastrous to English fortunes abroad and\r\ndistasteful to all patriotic Englishmen at home. And finally, the\r\nviolent means which the queen took to stamp out heresy gave her the\r\nunenviable surname of \"Bloody\" and reacted in the end in behalf of the\r\nviews for which the victims sacrificed their lives. During her reign\r\nnearly three hundred reformers perished, many of them, including\r\nArchbishop Cranmer, by fire. The work of the queen was in vain. No heir\r\nwas born to Philip and Mary, and the crown, therefore, passed to\r\nElizabeth, the daughter of Anne Boleyn, a Protestant not so much from\r\nconviction as from circumstance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Definite Fashioning of Anglicanism: the Reign of Elizabeth]\r\n\r\nIt was in the reign of Elizabeth (1558-1603) that the Church of England\r\nassumed definitely the doctrines and practices which we now connect\r\nwith the word \"Anglicanism.\" By act of Parliament, the English Church\r\nwas again separated from the papacy, and placed under royal authority,\r\nElizabeth assuming the title of \"supreme governor.\" The worship of the\r\nstate church was to be in conformity with a slightly altered version of\r\nCranmer's _Book of Common Prayer_. A uniform doctrine was likewise\r\nimposed by Parliament in the form of the _Thirty-nine Articles_,\r\nwhich set a distinctively Protestant mark upon the Anglican Church in\r\nits appeal to the Scriptures as the sole rule of faith, its insistence\r\non justification by faith alone, its repudiation of the sacrifice of\r\nthe Mass, and its definition of the Church. All the bishops who had\r\nbeen appointed under Mary, with one exception, refused to accept the\r\nchanges, and were therefore deposed and imprisoned, but new bishops,\r\nElizabeth's own appointees, were consecrated and the \"succession of\r\nbishops\" thereby maintained. Outwardly, the Church of England appeared\r\nto retain a corporate continuity throughout the sixteenth century;\r\ninwardly, a great revolution had changed it from Catholic to\r\nProtestant.\r\n\r\nHarsh laws sought to oblige all Englishmen to conform to Elizabeth's\r\nreligious settlement. Liberty of public worship was denied to any\r\ndissenter from Anglicanism. To be a \"papist\" or \"hear Mass\"--which were\r\nconstrued as the same thing--was punishable by death as high treason. A\r\nspecial ecclesiastical court--the Court of High Commission--was\r\nestablished under royal authority to search out heresy and to enforce\r\nuniformity; it served throughout Elizabeth's reign as a kind of\r\nProtestant Inquisition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English Dissent from Anglicanism]\r\n\r\nWhile the large majority of the English nation gradually conformed to\r\nthe official Anglican Church, a considerable number refused their\r\nallegiance. On one hand were the Roman Catholics, who still maintained\r\nthe doctrine of papal supremacy and were usually derisively styled\r\npapists, and on the other hand were various Calvinistic sects, such as\r\nPresbyterians or Independents or Quakers, who went by the name of\r\n\"Dissenters\" or \"Non-conformists.\" In the course of time, the number of\r\nRoman Catholics tended to diminish, largely because, for political\r\nreasons which have been indicated in the preceding chapter,\r\nProtestantism in England became almost synonymous with English\r\npatriotism. But despite drastic laws and dreadful persecutions, Roman\r\nCatholicism survived in England among a conspicuous group of people. On\r\nthe other hand, the Calvinists tended somewhat to increase their\r\nnumbers so that in the seventeenth century they were able to\r\nprecipitate a great political and ecclesiastical conflict with\r\nAnglicanism.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHOLIC REFORMATION\r\n\r\nWe have now traced the origins of the Protestant Revolt against the\r\nCatholic Church, and have seen how, between 1520 and 1570, three major\r\nvarieties of new theology--Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Anglicanism--\r\nappeared on the scene and divided among themselves the nations of\r\nnorthern Europe. The story of how, during that critical half-century,\r\nthe other civilized nations retained their loyalty to the Catholic\r\nChurch virtually as it had existed throughout the middle ages, remains\r\nto be told. The preservation of the papal monarchy and Catholic\r\ndoctrine in southern Europe was due alike to religious and to political\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that pious critics of ecclesiastical abuses\r\nwere confined to countries which subsequently became Protestant. There\r\nwere many sincere Catholics in Italy, Austria, France, and Spain who\r\ncomplained of the scandals and worldliness that afflicted the Church at\r\nthe opening of the sixteenth century: they demanded sweeping reforms in\r\ndiscipline and a return of the clergy to a simple apostolic life. They\r\nbelieved, however, that whatever change was desirable could best be\r\nachieved by means of a reformation within the Catholic Church--that is,\r\nwithout disturbing the unity of its organization or denying the\r\nvalidity of its dogmas--while the critics of northern Europe, as we\r\nhave seen, preferred to put their reforms into practice by means of a\r\nrevolution--an out-and-out break with century-old traditions of\r\nCatholic Christianity. Even in northern Europe some of the foremost\r\nscholars of that period desired an intellectual reformation within\r\nCatholicism rather than a dogmatic rebellion against it: with Luther's\r\ndefiance of papal authority, the great Erasmus had small sympathy, and\r\nSir Thomas More, the eminent English humanist, sacrificed his life for\r\nhis belief in the divine sanction of the papal power.\r\n\r\nThus, while the religious energy of northern Europe went into\r\nProtestantism of various kinds, that of southern Europe fashioned a\r\nreformation of the Catholic system. And this Catholic reformation, on\r\nits religious side, was brought to a successful issue by means of the\r\nimproved conditions in the papal court, the labors of a great church\r\ncouncil, and the activity of new monastic orders. A few words must be\r\nsaid about each one of these religious elements in the Catholic\r\nreformation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reforming Popes]\r\n\r\nMention has been made of the corruption that prevailed in papal affairs\r\nin the fifteenth century, and of the Italian and family interests which\r\nobscured to the Medici pope, Leo X (1513-1521), the importance of the\r\nLutheran movement in Germany. And Leo's nephew, who became Clement VII\r\n(1523-1534), continued to act too much as an Italian prince and too\r\nlittle as the moral and religious leader of Catholicism in the contest\r\nwhich under him was joined with Zwinglians and Anglicans as well as\r\nwith Lutherans. But under Paul III (1534-1549), a new policy was\r\ninaugurated, by which men were appointed to high church offices for\r\ntheir virtue and learning rather than for family relationship or\r\nfinancial gain. This policy was maintained by a series of upright and\r\nfar-sighted popes during the second half of the sixteenth century, so\r\nthat by the year 1600 a remarkable reformation had been gradually\r\nwrought in the papacy, among the cardinals, down through the prelates,\r\neven to the parish priests and monks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Council of Trent]\r\n\r\nThe reforming zeal of individual popes was stimulated and reinforced by\r\nthe work of the Council of Trent (1545-1563). The idea of effecting a\r\n\"reformation in head and members\" by means of a general council of the\r\nCatholic Church had been invoked several times during the century that\r\npreceded the Protestant Revolt, but, before Luther, little had been\r\naccomplished in that way.\r\n\r\nWith the widening of the breach between Protestantism and the medieval\r\nChurch, what had formerly been desirable now became imperative. It\r\nseemed to pious Catholics that every effort should be made to reconcile\r\ndifferences and to restore the unity of the Church. The errors of the\r\nmanifold new theologies which now appeared might be refuted by a clear\r\nstatement of Catholic doctrine, and a reformation of discipline and\r\nmorals would deprive the innovators of one of their most telling\r\nweapons against the Church.\r\n\r\nIt was no easy task, in that troublous time, to hold an ecumenical\r\ncouncil. There was mutual distrust between Catholics and Protestants.\r\nThere was uncertainty as to the relative powers and prerogatives of\r\ncouncil and pope. There were bitter national rivalries, especially\r\nbetween Italians and Germans. There was actual warfare between the two\r\nchief Catholic families--the Habsburgs of Germany and Spain and the\r\nroyal house of France.\r\n\r\nYet despite these difficulties, which long postponed its convocation\r\nand repeatedly interrupted its labors, the Council of Trent [Footnote:\r\nTrent was selected largely by reason of its geographical location,\r\nbeing situated on the boundary between the German-speaking and Italian-\r\nspeaking peoples.] consummated a great reform in the Church and\r\ncontributed materially to the preservation of the Catholic faith. The\r\nProtestants, whom the pope invited to participate, absented themselves;\r\nyet such was the number and renown of the Catholic bishops who\r\nresponded to the summons that the Council of Trent easily ranked with\r\nthe eighteen cumenical councils which had preceded it. [Footnote: Its\r\ndecrees were signed at its close (1563) by 4 cardinal legates, 2\r\ncardinals, 3 patriarchs, 25 archbishops, 167 bishops, 7 abbots, 7\r\ngenerals of orders, and 19 proxies for 33 absent prelates.] The work of\r\nthe council was twofold--dogmatic and reformatory.\r\n\r\nDogmatically, the fathers at Trent offered no compromise to the\r\nProtestants. They confirmed with inexorable frankness the main points\r\nin Catholic theology which had been worked out in the thirteenth\r\ncentury by Thomas Aquinas and which before the appearance of\r\nProtestantism had been received everywhere in central and western\r\nEurope. They declared that the tradition of the Church as well as the\r\nBible was to be taken as the basis of the Christian religion, and that\r\nthe interpretation of the Holy Scripture belonged only to the Church.\r\nThe Protestant teachings about grace and justification by faith were\r\ncondemned, and the seven sacraments were pronounced indispensable. The\r\nmiraculous and sacrificial character of the Lord's Supper (Mass) was\r\nreaffirmed. Belief in the invocation of saints, in the veneration of\r\nimages and of relics, in purgatory and indulgences was explicitly\r\nstated, but precautions were taken to clear some of the doctrines of\r\nthe pernicious practices which at times had been connected with them.\r\nThe spiritual authority of the Roman See was confirmed over all\r\nCatholicism: the pope was recognized as supreme interpreter of the\r\ncanons and incontestable chief of bishops.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reformatory Canons of the Council of Trent ]\r\n\r\nA volume of disciplinary statutes constituted the second achievement of\r\nthe Tridentine Council. The sale of church offices was condemned.\r\nBishops and other prelates were to reside in their respective dioceses,\r\nabandon worldly pursuits, and give themselves entirely to spiritual\r\nlabors. Seminaries were to be established for the proper education and\r\ntraining of priests.\r\n\r\nWhile Latin was retained as the official and liturgical language,\r\nfrequent sermons were to be preached in the vernacular. Indulgences\r\nwere not to be issued for money, and no charge should be made for\r\nconferring the sacraments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Index and inquisition ]\r\n\r\nThe seed sown by the council bore abundant fruit during several\r\nsucceeding pontificates. The central government was completely\r\nreorganized. A definite catechism was prepared at Rome and every layman\r\ninstructed in the tenets and obligations of his religion. Revisions\r\nwere made in the service books of the Church, and a new standard\r\nedition of the Latin Bible, the Vulgate, was issued. A list, called the\r\nIndex, was prepared of dangerous and heretical books, which good\r\nCatholics were prohibited from reading. By these methods, discipline\r\nwas in fact confirmed, morals purified, and the scandal of the immense\r\nriches and the worldly life of the clergy restrained. From an unusually\r\nstrict law of faith and conduct, lapses were to be punishable by the\r\nancient ecclesiastical court of the Inquisition, which now zealously\r\nredoubled its activity, especially in Italy and in Spain.\r\n\r\nA very important factor in the Catholic revival--not only in preserving\r\nall southern Europe to the Church but also in preventing a complete\r\ntriumph of Protestantism in the North--was the formation of several new\r\nreligious orders, which sought to purify the life of the people and to\r\nbulwark the position of the Church. The most celebrated of these\r\norders, both for its labors in the sixteenth century and for its\r\nsubsequent history, is the Society of Jesus, whose members are known\r\ncommonly as Jesuits. The society was founded by Ignatius Loyola\r\n[Footnote: Ignatius Loyola (1491-1556).] in 1534 and its constitution\r\nwas formally approved by the pope six years later.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ignatius Loyola]\r\n\r\nIn his earlier years, Ignatius followed the profession of arms, and as\r\na patriotic Spaniard fought valiantly in the armies of Emperor Charles\r\nV against the French. But while he was in a hospital, suffering from a\r\nwound, he chanced to read a Life of Christ and biographies of several\r\nsaints, which, he tells us, worked a great change within him. From\r\nbeing a soldier of an earthly king, he would now become a knight of\r\nChrist and of the Church. Instead of fighting for the glory of Spain\r\nand of himself, he would henceforth strive for the greater glory of\r\nGod. Thus in the very year in which the German monk, Martin Luther,\r\nbecame the leading and avowed adversary of the Catholic Church, this\r\nSpanish soldier was starting on that remarkable career which was to\r\nmake him Catholicism's chief champion.\r\n\r\nAfter a few years' trial of his new life and several rather footless\r\nefforts to serve the Church, Ignatius determined, at the age of thirty-\r\nthree, to perfect his scanty education. It was while he was studying\r\nLatin, philosophy, and theology at the University of Paris that he made\r\nthe acquaintance of the group of scholarly and saintly men who became\r\nthe first members of the Society of Jesus. Intended at first primarily\r\nfor missionary labors among the Mohammedans, the order was speedily\r\nturned to other and greater ends.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Jesuits]\r\n\r\nThe organization of the Jesuits showed the military instincts of their\r\nfounder. To the three usual vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience,\r\nwas added a fourth vow of special allegiance to the pope. The members\r\nwere to be carefully trained during a long novitiate and were to be\r\nunder the personal direction of a general, resident in Rome. Authority\r\nand obedience were stressed by the society. Then, too, St. Ignatius\r\nLoyola understood that the Church was now confronted with conditions of\r\nwar rather than of peace: accordingly he directed that his brothers\r\nshould not content themselves with prayer and works of peace, with\r\ncharity and local benevolence, but should adapt themselves to new\r\ncircumstances and should strive in a multiplicity of ways to restore\r\nall things in the Catholic Church.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that the Jesuits, from the very year of their\r\nestablishment, rushed to the front in the religious conflict of the\r\nsixteenth century. In the first place, they sought to enlighten and\r\neducate the young. As schoolmasters they had no equals in Europe for\r\nmany years. No less a scholar and scientist than Lord Francis Bacon\r\nsaid of the Jesuit teaching that \"nothing better has been put in\r\npractice.\" Again, by their wide learning and culture, no less than by\r\nthe unimpeachable purity of their lives, they won back a considerable\r\nrespect for the Catholic clergy. As preachers, too, they earned a high\r\nesteem by the clearness and simplicity of their sermons and\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nIt was in the mission field, however, that the Jesuits achieved the\r\nmost considerable results. They were mainly responsible for the\r\nrecovery of Poland after that country had almost become Lutheran. They\r\nsimilarly conserved the Catholic faith in Bavaria and in the southern\r\nNetherlands. They insured a respectable Catholic party in Bohemia and\r\nin Hungary. They aided considerably in maintaining Catholicism in\r\nIreland. At the hourly risk of their lives, they ministered to their\r\nfellow-Catholics in England under Elizabeth and the Stuarts. And what\r\nthe Catholic Church lost in numbers through the defection of the\r\ngreater part of northern Europe was compensated for by Jesuit missions\r\namong the teeming millions in India and China, among the Huron and\r\nIroquois tribes of North America, and among the aborigines of Brazil\r\nand Paraguay. No means of influence, no source of power, was neglected\r\nthat would win men to religion and to the authority of the bishop of\r\nRome. Politics and agriculture were utilized as well as literature and\r\nscience. The Jesuits were confessors of kings in Europe and apostles of\r\nthe faith in Asia and America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political and Economic Factors in the Catholic Reformation]\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out already that the rapid diffusion of\r\nProtestantism was due to economic and political causes as well as to\r\nthose narrowly religious. It may be said with equal truth that\r\npolitical and economic causes co-operated with the religious\r\ndevelopments that we have just noted in maintaining the supremacy of\r\nthe Catholic Church in at least half the countries over which she had\r\nexercised her sway in 1500. For one thing, it is doubtful whether\r\nfinancial abuses had flourished as long or as vigorously in southern as\r\nin northern Europe. For another, the political conditions in the states\r\nof southern Europe help to explain the interesting situation.\r\n\r\n[Sidebar: Italy]\r\n\r\nIn Italy was the pope's residence and See. He had bestowed many favors\r\non important Italian families. He had often exploited foreign countries\r\nin behalf of Italian patronage. He had taken advantage of the political\r\ndisunity of the peninsula to divide his local enemies and thereby to\r\nassure the victory of his own cause. Two popes of the sixteenth century\r\nbelonged to the powerful Florentine family of the Medici--Florence\r\nremained loyal. The hearty support of the Emperor Charles V preserved\r\nthe orthodoxy of Naples, and that of Philip II stamped out heresy in\r\nthe kingdom of the Two Sicilies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: France]\r\n\r\nIn France, the concordat of 1516 between pope and king had peacefully\r\nsecured for the French monarch appointment of bishops and control of\r\nbenefices within his country,--powers which the German princes and the\r\nEnglish sovereigns secured by revolutionary change. Moreover, French\r\nProtestantism, by its political activities in behalf of effective\r\nchecks upon the royal power, drove the king into Catholic arms: the\r\ncause of absolutism in France became the cause of Catholicism, and the\r\nlatter was bound up with French patriotism to quite the same extent as\r\nEnglish patriotism became linked with the fortunes of Anglicanism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spain and Portugal]\r\n\r\nIn Spain and Portugal, the monarchs obtained concessions from the pope\r\nlike those accorded the French sovereigns. They gained control of the\r\nCatholic Church within their countries and found it a most valuable\r\nally in forwarding their absolutist tendencies. Moreover, the\r\ncenturies-long struggle with Mohammedanism had endeared Catholic\r\nChristianity alike to Spaniards and to Portuguese and rendered it an\r\nintegral part of their national life. Spain and Portugal now remained\r\nfiercely Catholic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Austria]\r\n\r\nSomewhat similar was the case of Austria. Terrifying fear of the\r\nadvancing Turk, joined with the political exigencies of the Habsburg\r\nrulers, threw that duchy with most of its dependencies into the hands\r\nof the pope. If the bishop of Rome, by favoring the Habsburgs, had lost\r\nEngland, he had at least saved Austria.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Poland and Ireland]\r\n\r\nIreland and Poland--those two extreme outposts of the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch in Europe--found their religion to be the most effectual\r\nsafeguard of their nationality, the most valuable weapon against\r\naggression or assimilation by powerful neighbors.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE RELIGIOUS REVOLUTION IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\nBy the year 1570 the profound religious and ecclesiastical changes\r\nwhich we have been sketching had been made. For seventy-five years more\r\na series of wars was to be waged in which the religious element was\r\ndistinctly to enter. In fact these wars have often been called the\r\nReligious Wars--the ones connected with the career of Philip II of\r\nSpain as well as the subsequent dismal civil war in the Germanies--but\r\nin each one the political and economic factors predominated. Nor did\r\nthe series of wars materially affect the strength or extent of the\r\nreligions implicated. It was prior to 1570 that the Protestant Revolt\r\nhad been effected and the Catholic Reformation achieved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geographical Extent of the Revolt]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1500, the Roman Catholic Church embraced central and\r\nwestern Europe; in the year 1600 nearly half of its former subjects--\r\nthose throughout northern Europe--no longer recognized its authority or\r\npracticed its beliefs. There were left to the Roman Catholic Church at\r\nthe close of the sixteenth century the Italian states, Spain, Portugal,\r\nmost of France, the southern Netherlands, the forest cantons of\r\nSwitzerland, the southern Germanies, Austria, Poland, Ireland, large\r\nfollowings in Bohemia and Hungary, and a straggling unimportant\r\nfollowing in other countries.\r\n\r\nThose who rejected the Roman Catholic Church in central and western\r\nEurope were collectively called Protestants, but they were divided into\r\nthree major groups. Lutheranism was now the religion of the northern\r\nGermanies and the Scandinavian states of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.\r\nCalvinism, under a bewildering variety of names, was the recognized\r\nfaith of the majority of the cantons of Switzerland, of the northern\r\nNetherlands, and Scotland, and of important followings in Germany,\r\nHungary, France, and England. Anglicanism was the established religion\r\nof England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Doctrines Held in Common by Catholics and Protestants]\r\n\r\nThe Protestants retained a large part of Catholic theology, so that all\r\nportions of western Christianity continued to have much in common. They\r\nstill believed in the Trinity, in the divinity of Jesus Christ, in the\r\nsacredness of the Jewish scriptures and of the New Testament, the fall\r\nof man and his redemption through the sacrifice of the Cross, and in a\r\nfuture life of rewards and punishments. The Christian moralities and\r\nvirtues continued to be inculcated by Protestants as well as by\r\nCatholics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Doctrines Held by all Protestants Apart from Catholics]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Protestants held in common certain doctrines\r\nwhich separated all of them from Roman Catholicism. These were the\r\ndistinguishing marks of Protestantism: (1) denial of the claims of the\r\nbishop of Rome and consequent rejection of the papal government and\r\njurisdiction; (2) rejection of such doctrines as were supposed to have\r\ndeveloped during the middle ages,--for example, purgatory, indulgences,\r\ninvocation of saints, and veneration of relics,--together with\r\nimportant modifications in the sacramental system; (3) insistence upon\r\nthe right of the individual to interpret the Bible, and recognition of\r\nthe individual's ability to save himself without the interposition of\r\necclesiastics--hence to the Protestant, authority resided in individual\r\ninterpretation of the Bible, while to the Catholic, it rested in a\r\nliving institution or Church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Divisions among Protestants]\r\n\r\nNow the Protestant idea of authority made it possible and essentially\r\ninevitable that its supporters should not agree on many things among\r\nthemselves. There would be almost as many ways of interpreting the\r\nScriptures as there were interested individuals. It is not surprising,\r\ntherefore, that in the last Almanac some one hundred and sixty-four\r\nvarieties or denominations of Protestants are listed in the United\r\nStates alone. These divisions, however, are not so complex as at first\r\nmight appear, because nearly all of them have come directly from the\r\nthree main forms of Protestantism which appeared in the sixteenth\r\ncentury. Just how Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Anglicanism differed from\r\neach other may be gathered from a short summary.\r\n\r\n(1) The Calvinists taught justification by election--that God\r\ndetermines, or _predestines_, who is to be saved and who is to be\r\nlost. The Lutherans were inclined to reject such doctrine, and to\r\nassure salvation to the mere believer. The Anglicans appeared to accept\r\nthe Lutheran doctrine of justification by faith, although the Thirty-\r\nnine Articles might be likewise interpreted in harmony with the\r\nCalvinistic position.\r\n\r\n(2) The Calvinists recognized only two sacraments--baptism and the\r\nLord's Supper. Lutherans and Anglicans retained, in addition to the two\r\nsacraments, the rite of confirmation, and Anglicans also the rite of\r\nordination. The official statement of Anglicanism that there are \"two\r\nmajor sacraments\" has made it possible for some Anglicans--the so-\r\ncalled High Church party--to hold the Catholic doctrine of seven\r\nsacraments.\r\n\r\n(3) Various substitutes were made for the Catholic doctrine of\r\ntransubstantiation, the idea that in the Lord's Supper the bread and\r\nwine by the word of the priest are actually changed into the Body and\r\nBlood of Christ. The Lutherans maintained what they called\r\nconsubstantiation, that Christ was _with_ and _in_ the bread\r\nand wine, as fire is in a hot iron, to borrow the metaphor of Luther\r\nhimself. The Calvinists, on the other hand, saw in the Eucharist, not\r\nthe efficacious sacrifice of Christ, but a simple commemoration of the\r\nLast Supper; to them the bread and wine were mere symbols of the Body\r\nand Blood. As to the Anglicans, their position was ambiguous, for their\r\nofficial confession of faith declared at once that the Supper is the\r\ncommunion of the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ but that the\r\ncommunicant receives Jesus Christ only spiritually: the present-day\r\n\"Low Church\" Anglicans incline to a Calvinistic interpretation, those\r\nof the \"High Church\" to the Catholic explanation.\r\n\r\n(4) There were pronounced differences in ecclesiastical government. All\r\nthe Protestants considerably modified the Catholic system of a divinely\r\nappointed clergy of bishops, priests, and deacons, under the supreme\r\nspiritual jurisdiction of the pope. The Anglicans rejected the papacy,\r\nalthough they retained the orders of bishop, priest, and deacon, and\r\ninsisted that their hierarchy was the direct continuation of the\r\nmedieval Church in England, and therefore that their organization was\r\non the same footing as the Orthodox Church of eastern Europe. The\r\nLutherans rejected the divinely ordained character of episcopacy, but\r\nretained bishops as convenient administrative officers. The Calvinists\r\ndid away with bishops altogether and kept only one order of clergymen--\r\nthe presbyters. Such Calvinistic churches as were governed by\r\nassemblies or synods of presbyters were called Presbyterian; those\r\nwhich subordinated the \"minister\" to the control of the people in each\r\nseparate congregation were styled Independent, or Separatist, or\r\nCongregational. [Footnote: This latter type of church government was\r\nmaintained also by the quasi-Calvinistic denomination of the Baptists.]\r\n\r\n(5) In the ceremonies of public worship the Protestant churches\r\ndiffered. Anglicanism kept a good deal of the Catholic ritual although\r\nin the form of translation from Latin to English, together with several\r\nCatholic ceremonies, in some places even employing candles and incense.\r\nThe Calvinists, on the other hand, worshiped with extreme simplicity:\r\nreading of the Bible, singing of hymns, extemporaneous prayer, and\r\npreaching constituted the usual service in church buildings that were\r\nwithout superfluous ornaments. Between Anglican formalism and\r\nCalvinistic austerity, the Lutherans presented a compromise: they\r\ndevised no uniform liturgy, but showed some inclination to utilize\r\nforms and ceremonies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Significance of the Protestant Revolt]\r\n\r\nOf the true significance of the great religious and ecclesiastical\r\nchanges of the sixteenth century many estimates in the past have been\r\nmade, varying with the point of view, or bias, of each author. Several\r\nresults, however, now stand out clearly and are accepted generally by\r\nall scholars, regardless of religious affiliations. These results may\r\nbe expressed as follows:\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the Catholic Church of the middle ages was\r\ndisrupted and the medieval ideal of a universal theocracy under the\r\nbishop of Rome was rudely shocked.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the Christian religion was largely nationalized.\r\nProtestantism was the religious aspect of nationalism; it naturally\r\ncame into being as a protest against the cosmopolitan character of\r\nCatholicism; it received its support from _nations_; and it\r\nassumed everywhere a national form. The German states, the Scandinavian\r\ncountries, Scotland, England, each had its established state religion.\r\nWhat remained to the Catholic Church, as we have seen, was essentially\r\nfor national reasons and henceforth rested mainly on a national basis.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the whole movement tended to narrow the Catholic Church\r\ndogmatically. The exigencies of answering the Protestants called forth\r\nexplicit definitions of belief. The Catholic Church was henceforth on\r\nthe defensive, and among her members fewer differences of opinion were\r\ntolerated than formerly.\r\n\r\nFourthly, a great impetus to individual morality, as well as to\r\ntheological study, was afforded by the reformation. Not only were many\r\nmen's minds turned temporarily from other intellectual interests to\r\nreligious controversy, but the individual faithful Catholic or\r\nProtestant was encouraged to vie with his neighbor in actually proving\r\nthat his particular religion inculcated a higher moral standard than\r\nany other. It rendered the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries more\r\nearnest and serious and also more bigoted than the fifteenth.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Protestant Revolution led immediately to important\r\npolitical and social changes. The power of secular rulers was\r\nimmeasurably increased. By confiscation of church lands and control of\r\nthe clergy, the Tudor sovereigns in England, the kings in Scandinavia,\r\nand the German princes were personally enriched and freed from fear of\r\nbeing hampered in absolutist tendencies by an independent\r\necclesiastical organization. Even in Catholic countries, the monarchs\r\nwere able to wring such concessions from the pope as resulted in\r\nshackling the Church to the crown.\r\n\r\nThe wealth of the nobles was swelled, especially in Protestant\r\ncountries, by seizure of the property of the Church either directly or\r\nby means of bribes tendered for aristocratic support of the royal\r\nconfiscations. But despite such an access of wealth, the monarchs took\r\npains to see that the nobility acquired no new political influence.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent the nobles from recovering political power, the\r\nabsolutist monarchs enlisted the services of the faithful middle class,\r\nwhich speedily attained an enviable position in the principal European\r\nstates. It is safe to say that the Protestant Revolution was one of\r\nmany elements assisting in the development of this middle class.\r\n\r\nFor the peasantry--still the bulk of European population--the religious\r\nand ecclesiastical changes seem to have been peculiarly unfortunate.\r\nWhat they gained through a diminution of ecclesiastical dues and taxes\r\nwas more than lost through the growth of royal despotism and the\r\nexactions of hard-hearted lay proprietors. The peasants had changed the\r\nnames of their oppressors and found themselves in a worse condition\r\nthan before. There is little doubt that, at least so far as the\r\nGermanies and the Scandinavian countries are concerned, the lot of the\r\npeasants was less favorable immediately after, than immediately before,\r\nthe rise of Protestantism.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL READING\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL.

For the popes of the period, see Ludwig Pastor, _The\r\nHistory of the Popes from the Close of the Middle Ages_, the monumental\r\nwork of a distinguished Catholic historian, the twelfth volume of which\r\n(coming down to 1549) was published in English translation in 1912; and\r\nthe older but still useful (Protestant) _History of the Papacy from the\r\nGreat Schism to the Sack of Rome_ by Mandell Creighton, new ed. in 6\r\nvols. (1899-1901), and _History of the Popes_ by Leopold von Ranke, 3\r\nvols. in the Bonn Library (1885). Heinrich Denziger, _Enchiridion\r\nSymbolorum, Definitionum, et Declarationium de rebus fidei el morum,_\r\n11nth ed.

In the _Cambridge\r\nModern History,_ Vol. I (1902), a severe indictment of the Church is\r\npresented (ch. xix) by H. C. Lea, and a defense is offered (ch. xviii)\r\nby William Barry. The former opinions are developed startlingly by H.\r\nC. Lea in Vol. I, ch. i, of his _History of the Inquisition in the\r\nMiddle Ages._ An old-fashioned, though still interesting, Protestant\r\nview is that of William Roscoe, _Life and Pontificate of Leo X,_ 4\r\nvols. (first pub. 1805-1806, many subsequent editions). For an\r\nexcellent description of the organization of the Catholic Church, see\r\nAndré Mater, _L'église catholique, sa constitution, son administration_\r\n(1906). The best edition of the canon law is that of Friedberg, 2 vols.\r\n(1881). On the social work of the Church: E. L. Cutts, _Parish Priests\r\nand their People in the Middle Ages in England_ (1898), and G. A.\r\nPrévost, _L'église et les campagnes au moyen âge_ (1892). The most\r\nrecent and comprehensive study of the Catholic Church on the eve of the\r\nProtestant Revolt is that of Pierre Imbart de la Tour, _Les origines de\r\nla Réforme,_ Vol. I, _La France moderne_ (1905), and Vol. II, _L'église\r\ncatholique, la crise et la renaissance_ (1909).

Balmes, _European Civilization: Protestantism\r\nand Catholicity Compared in their Effects on the Civilization of\r\nEurope_ (1850), though old, is a suggestive résumé from the Catholic\r\nstandpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE CULTURE OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Culture\"]\r\n\r\n\"Culture\" is a word generally used to denote learning and refinement in\r\nmanners and art. The development of culture--the acquisition of new\r\nknowledge and the creation of beautiful things--is ordinarily the work\r\nof a comparatively small number of scientists and artists. Now if in\r\nany particular period or among any special people, we find a relatively\r\nlarger group of intellectual leaders who succeed in establishing an\r\nimportant educated class and in making permanent contributions to the\r\ncivilization of posterity, then we say that it is a cultured century or\r\na cultured nation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Greek Culture]\r\n\r\nAll races and all generations have had some kind of culture, but within\r\nthe recorded history of humanity, certain peoples and certain centuries\r\nstand out most distinctly as influencing its evolution. Thus, the\r\nGreeks of the fourth and fifth centuries before Christ gathered\r\ntogether and handed down to us all manner of speculation about the\r\nnature of the universe, all manner of hypothetical answers to the\r\neternal questions--Whence do we come, What are we doing, Where do we\r\ngo?--and this was the foundation of modern philosophy and metaphysics.\r\nFrom the same Greeks came our geometry and the rudiments of our\r\nsciences of astronomy and medicine. It was they who gave us the model\r\nfor nearly every form of literature--dramatic, epic, and lyric poetry,\r\ndialogues, oratory, history--and in their well-proportioned temples, in\r\ntheir balanced columns and elaborate friezes, in their marble\r\nchiselings of the perfect human form, they fashioned for us forever the\r\nclassical expression of art.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Roman Culture]\r\n\r\nStill in ancient times, the Romans developed classical architecture in\r\nthe great triumphal arches and in the high-domed public buildings which\r\nstrewed their empire. They adapted the fine forms of Greek literature\r\nto their own more pompous, but less subtle, Latin language. They\r\ndevised a code of law and a legal system which made them in a real\r\nsense the teachers of order and the founders of the modern study of\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mohammedan Culture]\r\n\r\nThe Mohammedans, too, at the very time when the Christians of western\r\nEurope were neglecting much of the ancient heritage, kept alive the\r\ntraditions of Greek philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, and medicine.\r\nFrom eastern Asia they borrowed algebra, the Arabic numerals, and the\r\ncompass, and, in their own great cities of Bagdad, Damascus, and\r\nCordova, they themselves developed the curiously woven curtains and\r\nrugs, the strangely wrought blades and metallic ornaments, the\r\nluxurious dwellings and graceful minarets which distinguish Arabic or\r\nMohammedan art.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Medieval Culture]\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth and thirteenth centuries--the height of the middle ages\r\n--came a wonderful outburst of intellectual and artistic activity.\r\nUnder the immediate auspices of the Catholic Church it brought forth\r\nabundantly a peculiarly Christian culture. Renewed acquaintance with\r\nGreek philosophy, especially with that of Aristotle, was joined with a\r\nlively religious faith to produce the so called scholastic philosophy\r\nand theology. Great institutions of higher learning--the universities--\r\nwere now founded, in which centered the revived study not only of\r\nphilosophy but of law and medicine as well, and over which appeared the\r\nfirst cloud-wrapped dawn of modern experimental science. And side by\r\nside with the sonorous Latin tongue, which long continued to be used by\r\nscholars, were formed the vernacular languages--German, English,\r\nFrench, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, etc.--that gave a wealth of\r\nvariety to reviving popular literature. Majestic cathedrals with\r\npointed arch and flying buttress, with lofty spire and delicate\r\ntracery, wonderful wood carvings, illuminated manuscripts, quaint\r\ngargoyles, myriad statues of saints and martyrs, delicately colored\r\npaintings of surpassing beauty--all betokened the great Christian, or\r\nGothic, art of the middle ages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New Elements in Culture of Sixteenth Century]\r\n\r\nThe educated person of the sixteenth century was heir to all these\r\ncultural periods: intellectually and artistically he was descended from\r\nGreeks, Romans, Mohammedans, and his medieval Christian forbears. But\r\nthe sixteenth century itself added cultural contributions to the\r\noriginal store, which help to explain not only the social, political,\r\nand ecclesiastical activities of that time but also many of our\r\npresent-day actions and ideas. The essentially new factors in\r\nsixteenth-century culture may be reckoned as (1) the diffusion of\r\nknowledge as a result of the invention of printing; (2) the development\r\nof literary criticism by means of humanism; (3) a golden age of\r\npainting and architecture; (4) the flowering of national literature;\r\n(5) the beginnings of modern natural science.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INVENTION OF PRINTING\r\n\r\nThe present day is notably distinguished by the prevalence of enormous\r\nnumbers of printed books, periodicals, and newspapers. Yet this very\r\nprinting, which seems so commonplace to us now, has had, in all, but a\r\ncomparatively brief existence. From the earliest recorded history up to\r\nless than five hundred years ago every book in Europe [Footnote: For an\r\naccount of early printing in China, Japan, and Korea, see the informing\r\narticle \"Typography\" in the _Encyclopædia Britannica_, 11th\r\nedition, Vol. XXVII, p. 510.] was laboriously written by hand,\r\n[Footnote: It is interesting to note the meaning of our present word\r\n\"manuscript,\" which is derived from the Latin--_manu scriptum_\r\n(\"written by hand\").] and, although copyists acquired an astonishing\r\nswiftness in reproducing books, libraries of any size were the property\r\nexclusively of rich institutions or wealthy individuals. It was at the\r\nbeginning of modern times that the invention of printing revolutionized\r\nintellectual history.\r\n\r\nPrinting is an extremely complicated process, and it is small wonder\r\nthat centuries of human progress elapsed before its invention was\r\ncomplete. Among the most essential elements of the perfected process\r\nare _movable type_ with which the impression is made, and\r\n_paper_, on which it is made. A few facts may be conveniently\r\nculled from the long involved story of the development of each of these\r\nelements.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Development of paper]\r\n\r\nFor their manuscripts the Greeks and Romans had used papyrus, the\r\nprepared fiber of a tough reed which grew in the valley of the Nile\r\nRiver. This papyrus was very expensive and heavy, and not at all\r\nsuitable for printing. Parchment, the dressed skins of certain animals,\r\nespecially sheep, which became the standard material for the hand-\r\nwritten documents of the middle ages, was extremely durable, but like\r\npapyrus, it was costly, unwieldy, and ill adapted for printing.\r\n\r\nThe forerunner of modern European paper was probably that which the\r\nChinese made from silk as early as the second century before Christ.\r\nFor silk the Mohammedans at Mecca and Damascus in the middle of the\r\neighth century appear to have substituted cotton, and this so-called\r\nDamascus paper was later imported into Greece and southern Italy and\r\ninto Spain. In the latter country the native-grown hemp and flax were\r\nagain substituted for cotton, and the resulting linen paper was used\r\nconsiderably in Castile in the thirteenth century and thence penetrated\r\nacross the Pyrenees into France and gradually all over western and\r\ncentral Europe. Parchment, however, for a long time kept its\r\npreeminence over silk, cotton, or linen paper, because of its greater\r\nfirmness and durability, and notaries were long forbidden to use any\r\nother substance in their official writings. Not until the second half\r\nof the fifteenth century was assured the triumph of modern paper,\r\n[Footnote: The word \"paper\" is derived from the ancient \"papyrus.\"] as\r\ndistinct from papyrus or parchment, when printing, then on the\r\nthreshold of its career, demanded a substance of moderate price that\r\nwould easily receive the impression of movable type.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Development of Movable Type]\r\n\r\nThe idea of movable type was derived from an older practice of carving\r\nreverse letters or even whole inscriptions upon blocks of wood so that\r\nwhen they were inked and applied to writing material they would leave a\r\nclear impression. Medieval kings and princes frequently had their\r\nsignatures cut on these blocks of wood or metal, in order to impress\r\nthem on charters, and a kind of engraving was employed to reproduce\r\npictures or written pages as early as the twelfth century.\r\n\r\nIt was a natural but slow evolution from block-impressing to the\r\npractice of casting individual letters in separate little pieces of\r\nmetal, all of the same height and thickness, and then arranging them in\r\nany desired sequence for printing. The great advantage of movable type\r\nover the blocks was the infinite variety of work which could be done by\r\nsimply setting and resetting the type.\r\n\r\nThe actual history of the transition from the use of blocks to movable\r\ntype--the real invention of modern printing--is shrouded in a good deal\r\nof mystery and dispute. It now appears likely that by the year 1450, an\r\nobscure Lourens Coster of the Dutch town of Haarlem had devised movable\r\ntype, that Coster's invention was being utilized by a certain Johan\r\nGutenberg in the German city of Mainz, and that improvements were being\r\nadded by various other contemporaries. Papal letters of indulgence and\r\na version of the Bible, both printed in 1454, are the earliest\r\nmonuments of the new art.\r\n\r\nSlowly evolved, the marvelous art, once thoroughly developed, spread\r\nwith almost lightning rapidity from Mainz throughout the Germanics, the\r\nItalian states, France, and England,--in fact, throughout all Christian\r\nEurope. It was welcomed by scholars and applauded by popes. Printing\r\npresses were erected at Rome in 1466, and book-publishing speedily\r\nbecame an honorable and lucrative business in every large city. Thus,\r\nat the opening of the sixteenth century, the scholarly Aldus Manutius\r\nwas operating in Venice the famous Aldine press, whose beautiful\r\neditions of the Greek and Latin classics are still esteemed as\r\nmasterpieces of the printer's art.\r\n\r\nThe early printers fashioned the characters of their type after the\r\nletters that the scribes had used in long-hand writing. Different kinds\r\nof common hand-writing gave rise, therefore, to such varieties of type\r\nas the heavy black-faced Gothic that prevailed in the Germanics or the\r\nseveral adaptations of the clear, neat Roman characters which\r\npredominated in southern Europe and in England. The compressed \"italic\"\r\ntype was devised in the Aldine press in Venice to enable the publisher\r\nto crowd more words upon a page.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Results of Invention of Printing]\r\n\r\nA constant development of the new art characterized the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and at least three remarkable results became evident. (1)\r\nThere was an almost incalculable increase in the supply of books. Under\r\nearlier conditions, a skilled and conscientious copyist might, by\r\nprodigious toil, produce two books in a year. Now, in a single year of\r\nthe sixteenth century, some 24,000 copies of one of Erasmus's books\r\nwere struck off by one printing press.\r\n\r\n(2) This indirectly increased the demand for books. By lessening the\r\nexpense of books and enabling at least all members of the middle class,\r\nas well as nobles and princes, to possess private libraries, printing\r\nbecame the most powerful means of diffusing knowledge and broadening\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n(3) A greater degree of accuracy was guaranteed by printing than by\r\nmanual copying. Before the invention of printing, it was well-nigh\r\nimpossible to secure two copies of any work that would be exactly\r\nalike. Now, the constant proof-reading and the fact that an entire\r\nedition was printed from the same type were securities against the\r\nanciently recurring faults of forgery or of error.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMANISM\r\n\r\nPrinting, the invention of which has just been described, was the new\r\nvehicle of expression for the ideas of the sixteenth century. These\r\nideas centered in something which commonly is called \"humanism.\" To\r\nappreciate precisely what humanism means--to understand the dominant\r\nintellectual interests of the educated people of the sixteenth century\r\n--it will be necessary first to turn back some two hundred years\r\nearlier and say a few words about the first great humanist, Francesco\r\nPetrarca, or, as he is known to us, Petrarch.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Petrarch, \"the Father of Humanism\"]\r\n\r\nThe name of Petrarch, who flourished in the fourteenth century (1304-\r\n1374), has been made familiar to most of us by sentimentalists or by\r\nliterary scholars who in the one case have pitied his loves and his\r\npassions or in the other have admired the grace and form of his Italian\r\nsonnets. But to the student of history Petrarch has seemed even more\r\nimportant as the reflection, if not the source, of a brilliant\r\nintellectual movement, which, taking rise in his century, was to grow\r\nin brightness in the fifteenth and flood the sixteenth with resplendent\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nIn some respects Petrarch was a typical product of the fourteenth\r\ncentury. He was in close touch with the great medieval Christian\r\nculture of his day. He held papal office at Avignon in France. He was\r\npious and \"old-fashioned\" in many of his religious views, especially in\r\nhis dislike for heretics. Moreover, he wrote what he professed to be\r\nhis best work in Latin and expressed naught but contempt for the new\r\nItalian language, which, under the immortal Dante, had already acquired\r\nliterary polish. [Footnote: Ironically enough, it was not his Latin\r\nwritings but his beautiful Italian sonnets, of which he confessed to be\r\nashamed, that have preserved the popular fame of Petrarch to the\r\npresent day.] He showed no interest in natural science or in the\r\nphysical world about him--no sympathy for any novelty.\r\n\r\nYet despite a good deal of natural conservatism, Petrarch added one\r\nsignificant element to the former medieval culture. That was an\r\nappreciation, amounting almost to worship, of the pagan Greek and Latin\r\nliterature. Nor was he interested in antique things because they\r\nsupported his theology or inculcated Christian morals; his fondness for\r\nthem was simply and solely because they were inherently interesting. In\r\na multitude of polished Latin letters and in many of his poems, as well\r\nas by daily example and precept to his admiring contemporaries, he\r\npreached the revival of the classics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Characteristics of Petrarch's Humanism]\r\n\r\nThis one obsessing idea of Petrarch carried with it several corollaries\r\nwhich constituted the essence of humanism and profoundly affected\r\nEuropean thought for several generations after the Italian poet. They\r\nmay be enumerated as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) Petrarch felt as no man had felt since pagan days the pleasure of\r\nmere human life,--the \"joy of living.\" This, he believed, was not in\r\nopposition to the Christian religion, although it contradicted the\r\nbasis of ascetic life. He remained a Catholic Christian, but he\r\nassailed the monks.\r\n\r\n(2) Petrarch possessed a confidence in himself, which in the constant\r\nrepetition in his writings of first-person pronouns partook of\r\nboastfulness. He replaced a reliance upon Divine Providence by a sense\r\nof his own human ability and power.\r\n\r\n(3) Petrarch entertained a clear notion of a living bond between\r\nhimself and men of like sort in the ancient world. Greek and Roman\r\ncivilization was to him no dead and buried antiquity, but its poets and\r\nthinkers lived again as if they were his neighbors. His love for the\r\npast amounted almost to an ecstatic enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n(4) Petrarch tremendously influenced his contemporaries. He was no\r\nlocal, or even national, figure. He was revered and respected as \"the\r\nscholar of Europe.\" Kings vied with each other in heaping benefits upon\r\nhim. The Venetian senate gave him the freedom of the city. Both the\r\nUniversity of Paris and the municipality of Rome crowned him with\r\nlaurel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Humanism\" and the \"Humanities\"; Definitions]\r\n\r\nThe admirers and disciples of Petrarch were attracted by the fresh and\r\noriginal human ideas of life with which such classical writers as\r\nVirgil, Horace, and Cicero overflowed. This new-found charm the\r\nscholars called humanity (_Humanitas_) and themselves they styled\r\n\"humanists.\" Their studies, which comprised the Greek and Latin\r\nlanguages and literatures, and, incidentally, profane history, were the\r\nhumanities or \"letters\" (_litterae humaniores_), and the pursuit\r\nof them was humanism.\r\n\r\nPetrarch himself was a serious Latin scholar but knew Greek quite\r\nindifferently. About the close of his century, however, Greek teachers\r\ncame in considerable numbers from Constantinople and Greece across the\r\nAdriatic to Italy, and a certain Chrysoloras set up an influential\r\nGreek school at Florence. [Footnote: This was before the capture of\r\nConstantinople by the Turks in 1453.] Thenceforth, the study of both\r\nLatin and Greek went on apace. Monasteries were searched for old\r\nmanuscripts; libraries for the classics were established; many an\r\nancient masterpiece, long lost, was now recovered and treasured as fine\r\ngold. [Footnote: It was during this time that long-lost writings of\r\nTacitus, Cicero, Quintilian, Plautus, Lucretius, etc., were\r\nrediscovered.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Humanism and Christianity]\r\n\r\nAt first, humanism met with some opposition from ardent churchmen who\r\nfeared that the revival of pagan literature might exert an unwholesome\r\ninfluence upon Christianity. But gradually the humanists came to be\r\ntolerated and even encourage, until several popes, notably Julius II\r\nand Leo X at the opening of the sixteenth century, themselves espoused\r\nthe cause of humanism. The father of Leo X was the celebrated Lorenzo\r\nde' Medici, who subsidized humanists and established the great\r\nFlorentine library of Greek and Latin classics; and the pope proved\r\nhimself at once the patron and exemplar of the new learning: he enjoyed\r\nmusic and the theater, art and poetry, the masterpieces of the ancients\r\nand the creations of his humanistic contemporaries, the spiritual and\r\nthe witty--life in every form.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spread of Humanism]\r\n\r\nThe zeal for humanism reached its highest pitch in Italy in the\r\nfifteenth century and the first half of the sixteenth, but it gradually\r\ngained entrance into other countries and at length became the\r\nintellectual spirit of sixteenth-century Europe. Greek was first taught\r\nboth in England and in France about the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. The Italian expeditions of the French kings Charles VIII,\r\nLouis XII, and Francis I, 1494-1547, served to familiarize Frenchmen\r\nwith humanism. And the rise of important new German universities called\r\nhumanists to the Holy Roman Empire. As has been said, humanism\r\ndominated all Christian Europe in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Erasmus, Chief Humanist of the Sixteenth Century]\r\n\r\nTowering above all his contemporaries was Erasmus, the foremost\r\nhumanist and the intellectual arbiter of the sixteenth century. Erasmus\r\n(1466-1536) was a native of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, but\r\nthroughout a long and studious life he lived in Germany, France,\r\nEngland, Italy, and Switzerland. He took holy orders in the Church and\r\nsecured the degree of doctor of sacred theology, but it was as a lover\r\nof books and a prolific writer that he earned his title to fame.\r\nErasmus, to an even greater degree than Petrarch, became a great\r\ninternational figure--the scholar of Europe. He corresponded with every\r\nimportant writer of his generation, and he was on terms of personal\r\nfriendship with Aldus Manutius, the famous publisher of Venice, with\r\nSir Thomas More, the distinguished statesman and scholar of England,\r\nwith Pope Leo X, with Francis I of France, and with Henry VIII of\r\nEngland. For a time he presided at Paris over the new College of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nA part of the work of Erasmus--his Greek edition of the New Testament\r\nand his _Praise of Folly_--has already been mentioned. In a series\r\nof satirical dialogues--the _Adages_ and the _Colloquies_--he\r\ndisplayed a brilliant intellect and a sparkling wit. With quip and jest\r\nhe made light of the ignorance and credulity of many clergymen,\r\nespecially of the monks. He laughed at every one, himself included.\r\n\"Literary people,\" said he, \"resemble the great figured tapestries of\r\nFlanders, which produce effect only when seen from the distance.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Humanism and Protestantism]\r\n\r\nAt first Erasmus was friendly with Luther, but as he strongly\r\ndisapproved of rebellion against the Church, he subsequently assailed\r\nLuther and the whole Protestant movement. He remained outside the group\r\nof radical reformers, to the end devoted to his favorite authors,\r\nsimply a lover of good Latin.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the chief reason why Erasmus opposed Protestantism was because\r\nhe imagined that the theological tempest which Luther aroused all over\r\nCatholic Europe would destroy fair-minded scholarship--the very essence\r\nof humanism. Be that as it may, the leading humanists of Europe--More\r\nin England, Helgesen in Denmark, and Erasmus himself--remained\r\nCatholic. And while many of the sixteenth-century humanists of Italy\r\ngrew skeptical regarding all religion, their country, as we have seen,\r\ndid not become Protestant but adhered to the Roman Church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decline of Humanism]\r\n\r\nGradually, as the sixteenth century advanced, many persons who in an\r\nearlier generation would have applied their minds to the study of Latin\r\nor Greek, now devoted themselves to theological discussion or moral\r\nexposition. The religious differences between Catholics and\r\nProtestants, to say nothing of the refinements of dispute between\r\nCalvinists and Lutherans or Presbyterians and Congregationalists,\r\nabsorbed much of the mental energy of the time and seriously distracted\r\nthe humanists. In fact, we may say that, from the second half of the\r\nsixteenth century, humanism as an independent intellectual interest\r\nslowly but steadily declined. Nevertheless, it was not lost, for it was\r\nmerged with other interests, and with them has been preserved ever\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nHumanism, whose seed was sown by Petrarch in the fourteenth century and\r\nwhose fruit was plucked by Erasmus in the sixteenth, still lives in\r\nhigher education throughout Europe and America. The historical\r\n\"humanities\"--Latin, Greek, and history--are still taught in college\r\nand in high school. They constitute the contribution of the dominant\r\nintellectual interest of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nART IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Humanism and the Renaissance of Art]\r\n\r\nThe effect of the revived interest in Greek and Roman culture, which,\r\nas we have seen, dominated European thought from the fourteenth to the\r\nsixteenth century, was felt not only in literature and in the outward\r\nlife of its devotees--in ransacking monasteries for lost manuscripts\r\nscripts, in critically studying ancient learning, and in consciously\r\nimitating antique behavior--but likewise in a marvelous and many-sided\r\ndevelopment of art.\r\n\r\nThe art of the middle ages had been essentially Christian--it sprang\r\nfrom the doctrine and devotions of the Catholic Church and was\r\ninextricably bound up with Christian life. The graceful Gothic\r\ncathedrals, pointing their roofs and airy spires in heavenly\r\naspiration, the fantastic and mysterious carvings of wood or stone, the\r\nimaginative portraiture of saintly heroes and heroines as well as of\r\nthe sublime story of the fall and redemption of the human race, the\r\nrichly stained glass, and the spiritual organ music--all betokened the\r\nsupreme thought of medieval Christianity. But humanism recalled to\r\nmen's minds the previous existence of an art simpler and more\r\nrestrained, if less ethereal. The reading of Greek and Latin writers\r\nheightened an esteem for pagan culture in all its phases.\r\n\r\nTherefore, European art underwent a transformation in the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth centuries. While much of the distinctively medieval culture\r\nremained, civilization was enriched by a revival of classical art. The\r\npainters, the sculptors, and the architects now sought models not\r\nexclusively in their own Christian masters but in many cases in pagan\r\nGreek and Roman forms. Gradually the two lines of development were\r\nbrought together, and the resulting union--the adaptation of classical\r\nart-forms to Christian uses--was marked by an unparalleled outburst of\r\nartistic energy.\r\n\r\nFrom that period of exuberant art-expression in the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth centuries, our present-day love of beautiful things has come\r\ndown in unbroken succession. With no exaggeration it may be said that\r\nthe sixteenth century is as much the basis of our modern artistic life\r\nas it is the foundation of modern Protestantism or of modern world\r\nempire. The revolutions in commerce and religion synchronized with the\r\nbeginning of a new era in art. All arts were affected--architecture,\r\nsculpture, painting, engraving, and music.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Architecture]\r\n\r\nIn architecture, the severely straight and plain line of the ancient\r\nGreek temples or the elegant gentle curve of the Roman dome was\r\nsubstituted for the fanciful lofty Gothic. A rounded arch replaced the\r\npointed. And the ancient Greek orders--Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian--\r\nwere dragged from oblivion to embellish the simple symmetrical\r\nbuildings. The newer architecture was used for ecclesiastical and other\r\nstructures, reaching perhaps its highest expression in the vast\r\ncathedral of St. Peter, which was erected at Rome in the sixteenth\r\ncentury under the personal direction of great artists, among whom\r\nRaphael and Michelangelo are numbered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In Italy]\r\n\r\nThe revival of Greek and Roman architecture, like humanism, had its\r\norigin in Italy; and in the cities of the peninsula, under patronage of\r\nwealthy princes and noble families, it attained its most general\r\nacceptance. But, like humanism, it spread to other countries, which in\r\nturn it deeply affected. The chronic wars, in which the petty Italian\r\nstates were engaged throughout the sixteenth century, were attended, as\r\nwe have seen, by perpetual foreign interference. But Italy, vanquished\r\nin politics, became the victor in art. While her towns surrendered to\r\nforeign armies, her architects and builders subdued Europe and brought\r\nthe Christian countries for a time under her artistic sway.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In France]\r\n\r\nThus in France the revival was accelerated by the military campaigns of\r\nCharles VIII, Louis XII, and Francis I, which led to the revelation of\r\nthe architectural triumphs in Italy, the result being the importation\r\nof great numbers of Italian designers and craftsmen. Architecture after\r\nthe Greek or Roman manner at once became fashionable. Long, horizontal\r\nlines appeared in many public buildings, of which the celebrated palace\r\nof the Louvre, begun in the last year of the reign of Francis I (1546),\r\nand to-day the home of one of the world's greatest art collections, is\r\na conspicuous example.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In Other Countries]\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the sixteenth century, the new architecture\r\nsimilarly entered Spain and received encouragement from Philip II.\r\nAbout the same time it manifested itself in the Netherlands and in the\r\nGermanies. In England, its appearance hardly took place in the\r\nsixteenth century. it was not until 1619 that a famous architect, Inigo\r\nJones (1573-1651), designed and reared the classical banqueting house\r\nin Whitehall, and not until the second half of the seventeenth century\r\ndid Sir Christopher Wren (1632-1723), by means of the majestic St.\r\nPaul's cathedral in London, render the new architecture popular in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sculpture]\r\n\r\nSculpture is usually an attendant of architecture, and it is not\r\nsurprising, therefore, that transformation of the one should be\r\nconnected with change in the other. The new movement snowed itself in\r\nItalian sculpture as early as the fourteenth century, owing to the\r\ninfluence of the ancient monuments which still abounded throughout the\r\npeninsula and to which the humanists attracted attention. In the\r\nfifteenth century archaeological discoveries were made and a special\r\ninterest fostered by the Florentine family of the Medici, who not only\r\nbecame enthusiastic collectors of ancient works of art but promoted the\r\nstudy of the antique figure. Sculpture followed more and more the Greek\r\nand Roman traditions in form and often in subject as well. The plastic\r\nart of Italy in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was strikingly\r\nakin to that of Athens in the fifth or fourth centuries before Christ.\r\n\r\nThe first great apostle of the new sculpture was Lorenzo Ghiberti\r\n(1378-1455), whose marvelous doors on the baptistery at Florence\r\nelicited the comment of Michelangelo that they were \"worthy of being\r\nplaced at the entrance of paradise.\" Slightly younger than Ghiberti was\r\nDonatello (1383-1466), who, among other triumphs, fashioned the\r\nrealistic statue of St. Mark in Venice. Luca della Robbia (1400-1482),\r\nwith a classic purity of style and simplicity of expression, founded a\r\nwhole dynasty of sculptors in glazed terra-cotta. Elaborate tomb-\r\nmonuments, the construction of which started in the fifteenth century,\r\nreached their highest magnificence in the gorgeous sixteenth-century\r\ntomb of Giovanni Galeazzo Visconti, the founder of the princely family\r\nof Visconti in Milan. Michelangelo himself was as famous for his\r\nsculpture as for his painting or his architecture; the heroic head of\r\nhis David at Florence is a work of unrivaled dignity. As the style of\r\nclassic sculpture became very popular in the sixteenth century, the\r\nsubjects were increasingly borrowed from pagan literature. Monuments\r\nwere erected to illustrious men of ancient Rome, and Greek mythology\r\nwas once more carved in stone.\r\n\r\nThe extension of the new sculpture beyond Italy was even more rapid\r\nthan the spread of the new architecture. Henry VII invited Italian\r\nsculptors to England; Louis XII patronized the great Leonardo da Vinci,\r\nand Francis I brought him to France. The tomb of Ferdinand and Isabella\r\nin Spain was fashioned in classic form. The new sculpture was famous in\r\nGermany before Luther; in fact, it was to be found everywhere in\r\nsixteenth-century Europe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Painting]\r\n\r\nPainting accompanied sculpture. Prior to the sixteenth century, most of\r\nthe pictures were painted directly upon the plaster walls of churches\r\nor of sumptuous dwellings and were called frescoes, although a few were\r\nexecuted on wooden panels. In the sixteenth century, however, easel\r\npaintings--that is, detached pictures on canvas, wood, or other\r\nmaterial--became common. The progress in painting was not so much an\r\nimitation of classical models as was the case with sculpture and\r\narchitecture, for the reason that painting, being one of the most\r\nperishable of the arts, had preserved few of its ancient Greek or Roman\r\nexamples. But the artists who were interested in architecture and\r\nsculpture were likewise naturally interested in painting; and painting,\r\nbound by fewer antique traditions, reached a higher degree of\r\nperfection in the sixteenth century than did any of its allied arts.\r\n\r\nModern painting was born in Italy. In Italy it found its four great\r\nmasters--Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Titian. The\r\nfirst two acquired as great a fame in architecture and in sculpture as\r\nin painting; the last two were primarily painters.\r\n\r\nLeonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), a Florentine by birth and training, was\r\npatronized in turn by the Sforza family of Milan, by the Medici of\r\nFlorence, and by the French royal line. His great paintings--the Holy\r\nSupper and Madonna Lisa, usually called La Gioconda--carried to a high\r\ndegree the art of composition and the science of light and shade and\r\ncolor. In fact, Leonardo was a scientific painter--he carefully studied\r\nthe laws of perspective and painstakingly carried them into practice.\r\nHe was also a remarkable sculptor, as is testified by his admirable\r\nhorses in relief. As an engineer, too, he built a canal in northern\r\nItaly and constructed fortifications about Milan. He was a musician and\r\na natural philosopher as well. This many-sided man liked to toy with\r\nmechanical devices. One day when Louis XII visited Milan, he was met by\r\na large mechanical lion that roared and then reared itself upon its\r\nhaunches, displaying upon its breast the coat-of-arms of France: it was\r\nthe work of Leonardo da Vinci. Leonardo influenced his age perhaps more\r\nthan any other artist. He wrote extensively. He gathered about himself\r\na large group of disciples. And in his last years spent in France, as a\r\npensioner of Francis I, he encouraged painting in that country as well\r\nas in Italy.\r\n\r\nMichelangelo (1475-1564), Florentine like Leonardo, was probably the\r\nmost wonderful of all these artists because of his triumphs in a vast\r\nvariety of endeavors. It might almost be said of him that \"jack of all\r\ntrades, he was master of all.\" He was a painter of the first rank, an\r\nincomparable sculptor, a great architect, an eminent engineer, a\r\ncharming poet, and a profound scholar in anatomy and physiology.\r\nDividing his time between Florence and Rome, he served the Medici\r\nfamily and a succession of art-loving popes. With his other qualities\r\nof genius he combined austerity in morals, uprightness in character, a\r\nlively patriotism for his native city and people, and a proud\r\nindependence. To give any idea of his achievements is impossible in a\r\nbook of this size. His tomb of Julius II in Rome and his colossal\r\nstatue of David in Florence are examples of his sculpture; the\r\ncathedral of St. Peter, which he practically completed, is his most\r\nenduring monument; the mural decorations in the Sistine Chapel at Rome,\r\ntelling on a grandiose scale the Biblical story from Creation to the\r\nFlood, are marvels of design; and his grand fresco of the Last Judgment\r\nis probably the most famous single painting in the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Raphael]\r\n\r\nYounger than Michelangelo and living only about half as long, Raphael\r\n(1483-1520), nevertheless, surpassed him in the harmonious composition\r\nand linear beauty of his painting. For ineffable charm of grace, \"the\r\ndivine\" Raphael has always stood without a peer. Raphael lived the\r\nbetter part of his life at Rome under the patronage of Julius II and\r\nLeo X, and spent several years in decorating the papal palace of the\r\nVatican. Although he was, for a time, architect of St. Peter's\r\ncathedral, and displayed some aptitude for sculpture and for the\r\nscholarly study of archæeology, it is as the greatest of modern\r\npainters that he is now regarded. Raphael lived fortunately, always in\r\nfavor, and rich, and bearing himself like a prince.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Titian]\r\n\r\nTitian (c. 1477-1576) was the typical representative of the Venetian\r\nschool of painting which acquired great distinction in bright coloring.\r\nOfficial painter for the city of Venice and patronized both by the\r\nEmperor Charles V and by Philip II of Spain, he secured considerable\r\nwealth and fame. He was not a man of universal genius like Leonardo da\r\nVinci or Michelangelo; his one great and supreme endowment was that of\r\noil painting. In harmony, light, and color, his work has never been\r\nequaled. Titian's portrait of Philip II was sent to England and proved\r\na potent auxiliary in the suit of the Spanish king for the hand of Mary\r\nTudor. His celebrated picture of the Council of Trent was executed\r\nafter the aged artist's visit to the council about 1555.\r\n\r\nFrom Italy as a center, great painting became the heritage of all\r\nEurope. Italian painters were brought to France by Louis XII and\r\nFrancis I, and French painters were subsidized to imitate them. Philip\r\nII proved himself a liberal patron of painting throughout his\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dürer]\r\n\r\nIn Germany, painting was developed by Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528), a\r\nnative of Nuremberg, who received a stimulus from Italian work and was\r\nroyally patronized by the Emperor Maximilian. The career of Dürer was\r\nhonored and fortunate: he was on terms of friendship with all the first\r\nmasters of his age; he even visited and painted Erasmus. But it is as\r\nan etcher or engraver, rather than as a painter, that Dürer's\r\nreputation was earned. His greatest engravings--such as the Knight and\r\nDeath, and St. Jerome in his Study--set a standard in a new art which\r\nhas never been reached by his successors. The first considerable\r\nemployment of engraving, one of the most useful of the arts,\r\nsynchronized with the invention of printing. Just as books were a means\r\nof multiplying, cheapening, and disseminating ideas, so engravings on\r\ncopper or wood were the means of multiplying, cheapening, and\r\ndisseminating pictures which gave vividness to the ideas, or served in\r\nplace of books for those who could not read.\r\n\r\nThe impetus afforded by this extraordinary development of painting\r\ncontinued to affect the sixteenth century and a greater part of the\r\nseventeenth. The scene shifted, however, from Italy to the Spanish\r\npossessions. And Spanish kings, the successors of Philip II, patronized\r\nsuch men as Rubens (1577-1640) and Van Dyck (1599-1641) in the Belgian\r\nNetherlands, or Velasquez (1590-1660) and Murillo (1617-1682) in Spain\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rubens and Van Dyck]\r\n\r\nIf the work of Rubens displayed little of the earlier Italian grace and\r\nrefinement, it at any rate attained to distinction in the purely\r\nfanciful pictures which he painted in bewildering numbers, many of\r\nwhich, commissioned by Marie de' Medici and King Louis XIII of France,\r\nare now to be seen in the Louvre galleries in Paris. And Van Dyck\r\nraised portrait painting to unthought-of excellence: his portraits of\r\nthe English royal children and of King Charles I are world-famous.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Velasquez]\r\n[Sidenote: Murillo]\r\n\r\nWithin the last century, many connoisseurs of art have been led to\r\nbelieve that Velasquez formerly has been much underrated and that he\r\ndeserves to rank with the foremost Italian masters. Certainly in all\r\nhis work there is a dignity, power, and charm, especially in that well-\r\nknown Maids of Honor, where a little Spanish princess is depicted\r\nholding her court, surrounded by her ladies-in-waiting, her dwarfs and\r\nher mastiff, while the artist himself stands at his easel. The last\r\nfeat of Velasquez was to superintend the elaborate decorations in honor\r\nof the marriage of the Spanish Infanta with King Louis XIV of France.\r\nMurillo, the youngest of all these great painters, did most of his work\r\nfor the Catholic Church and naturally dealt with ecclesiastical\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nA somewhat different type of painter is found in the Dutchman,\r\nRembrandt (1606-1669), who lived a stormy and unhappy life in the towns\r\nof Leyden and Amsterdam. It must be remembered that Holland, while\r\nfollowing her national career of independence, commerce, and colonial\r\nundertaking, had become stanchly Protestant. Neither the immoral\r\npaganism of antiquity nor the medieval legends of Catholicism would\r\nlonger appeal to the Dutch people as fit subjects of art. Rembrandt,\r\nprototype of a new school, therefore painted the actual life of the\r\npeople among whom he lived and the things which concerned them--lively\r\nportraits of contemporary burgomasters, happy pictures of popular\r\namusements, stern scenes from the Old Testament. His Lesson in Anatomy\r\nand his Night Watch in their somber settings, are wonderfully realistic\r\nproducts of Rembrandt's mastery of the brush.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rembrandt]\r\n[Sidenote: Music]\r\n\r\nThus painting, like architecture and sculpture, was perfected in\r\nsixteenth-century Italy and speedily became the common property of\r\nChristian Europe. Music, too, the most primitive and universal of the\r\narts, owes in its modern form very much to the sixteenth century.\r\nDuring that period the barbarous and uncouth instruments of the middle\r\nages were reformed. The rebeck, to whose loud and harsh strains the\r\nmedieval rustic had danced, [Footnote: The rebeck probably had been\r\nborrowed from the Mohammedans.] by the addition of a fourth string and\r\na few changes in form, became the sweet-toned violin, the most\r\nimportant and expressive instrument of the modern orchestra. As\r\nimmediate forerunner of our present-day pianoforte, the harpsichord was\r\ninvented with a keyboard carried to four octaves and the chords of each\r\nnote doubled or quadrupled to obtain prolonged tones.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Palestrina]\r\n\r\nIn the person of the papal organist and choir-master, Palestrina (1524-\r\n1594), appeared the first master-composer. He is justly esteemed as the\r\nfather of modern religious music and for four hundred years the\r\nCatholic Church has repeated his inspired accents. A pope of the\r\ntwentieth century declared his music to be still unrivaled and directed\r\nits universal use. Palestrina directly influenced much of the Italian\r\nmusic of the seventeenth century and the classical German productions\r\nof the eighteenth.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL LITERATURE OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Latin and the Vernaculars]\r\n\r\nLatin had been the learned language of the middle ages: it was used in\r\nthe Church, in the universities, and in polite society. If a lecturer\r\ntaught a class or an author wrote a book, Latin was usually employed.\r\nIn those very middle ages, however, the nations of western Europe were\r\ndeveloping spoken languages quite at variance with the classical,\r\nscholarly tongue. These so-called vernacular languages were not often\r\nwritten and remained a long time the exclusive means of expression of\r\nthe lower classes--they consequently not only differed from each other\r\nbut tended in each case to fall into a number of petty local dialects.\r\nSo long as they were not largely written, they could achieve no fixity,\r\nand it was not until after the invention of printing that the national\r\nlanguages produced extensive national literatures.\r\n\r\nJust when printing was invented, the humanists--the foremost scholars\r\nof Europe--were diligently engaged in strengthening the position of\r\nLatin by encouraging the study of the pagan classics. Virgil, Cicero,\r\nCaesar, Tacitus, and the comedies of Plautus and Terence were again\r\nread by educated people for their substance and for their style.\r\nPetrarch imitated the manner of Latin classics in his letters; Erasmus\r\nwrote his great works in Latin. The revival of Greek, which was also\r\ndue to the humanists, added to the learning and to the literature of\r\nthe cultured folk, but Greek, even more than Latin, was hardly\r\nunderstood or appreciated by the bulk of the people.\r\n\r\nThen came the sixteenth century, with its artistic developments, its\r\nnational rivalries, its far-away discoveries, its theological debates,\r\nand its social and religious unrest. The common people, especially the\r\ncommercial middle class, clamored to understand: and the result was the\r\nappearance of national literatures on a large scale. Alongside of\r\nLatin, which was henceforth restricted to the liturgy of the Roman\r\nCatholic Church and to particularly learned treatises, there now\r\nemerged truly literary works in Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese,\r\nGerman, English, etc. The printing of these works at once stereotyped\r\ntheir respective languages, so that since the sixteenth century the\r\nwritten forms of the vernacular tongues have been subject to relatively\r\nminor change. Speaking generally, the sixteenth century witnessed the\r\nfixing of our best known modern languages.\r\n\r\nTo review all the leading writers who employed the various vernaculars\r\nin the sixteenth century would encroach too much upon the province of\r\nprofessed histories of comparative literature, but a few references to\r\ncertain figures that tower head and shoulders above all others in their\r\nrespective countries may serve to call vividly to mind the importance\r\nof the period for national literatures.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Italian Literature]\r\n\r\nAt the very outset, one important exception must be made in favor of\r\nItaly, whose poetry and prose had already been immortalized by Dante,\r\nPetrarch, and Boccaccio a hundred years and more before the opening of\r\nthe sixteenth century. But that country, as we have already repeatedly\r\nobserved in many kinds of art, anticipated all others in modern times.\r\nItaly, almost the last European land to be politically unified, was the\r\nfirst to develop a great national literature.\r\n\r\nBut Italian literature was broadened and popularized by several\r\ninfluential writers in the sixteenth century, among whom stand\r\npreeminent the Florentine diplomat Machiavelli (1469-1527), whose\r\n_Prince_ really founded the modern science of politics, and who\r\ntaught the dangerous doctrine that a ruler, bent on exercising a\r\nbenevolent despotism, is justified in employing any means to achieve\r\nhis purpose; Ariosto (1474-1533), whose great poem _Orlando\r\nFurioso_ displayed a powerful imagination no less than a rare and\r\ncultivated taste; and the unhappy mad Tasso (1544-1595), who in\r\n_Jerusalem Delivered_ produced a bulky epic poem, adapting the\r\nmanner of Virgil to a crusading subject, and in Aminta gave to his\r\ncountrymen a delightful pastoral drama, the exquisite lyrics of which\r\nwere long sung in opera.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French literature]\r\n\r\nFrench literature, like other French art, was encouraged by Francis I.\r\nHe set up printing presses, established the College of France, and\r\npensioned native writers. The most famous French author of the time was\r\nthe sarcastic and clever Rabelais (c. 1490-1553), whose memorable\r\n_Gargantua_ comprised a series of daring fanciful tales, told with\r\nhumor of a rather vulgar sort. The language of _Gargantua_ is\r\nsomewhat archaic--perhaps the French version of Calvin's\r\n_Institutes_ would be a better example of the French of the\r\nsixteenth century. But France, thus seriously beginning her national\r\nliterature, was to wait for its supremacy until the seventeenth\r\ncentury--until the institution of the French Academy and the age of\r\nLouis XIV.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spanish Literature]\r\n\r\nSpanish literature flourished in the golden era when Velasquez and\r\nMurillo were painting their masterpieces. The immortal _Don\r\nQuixote_, which was published in 1604, entitles its author,\r\nCervantes (1547-1616), to rank with the greatest writers of all time.\r\nLope de Vega (1562-1635), far-famed poet, virtually founded the Spanish\r\ntheater and is said to have composed eighteen hundred dramatic pieces.\r\nCalderon (1600-1681), although less effective in his numerous dramas,\r\nwrote allegorical poems of unequaled merit. The printing of large cheap\r\neditions of many of these works made Spanish literature immediately\r\npopular.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Portuguese Literature]\r\n\r\nHow closely the new vernacular literatures reflected significant\r\nelements in the national life is particularly observable in the case of\r\nPortugal. It was of the wonderful exploring voyages of Vasco da Gama\r\nthat Camoens (1524-1580), prince of Portuguese poets, sang his stirring\r\n_Lusiads_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: German Literature]\r\n\r\nIn the Germanies, the extraordinary influence of humanism at first\r\nmilitated against the development of literature in the vernacular, but\r\nthe Protestant reformer, Martin Luther, in his desire to reach the ears\r\nof the common people, turned from Latin to German. Luther's translation\r\nof the Bible constitutes the greatest monument in the rise of modern\r\nGerman.\r\n\r\nTo speak of what our own English language and literature owe to the\r\nsixteenth century seems superfluous. The popular writings of Chaucer in\r\nthe fourteenth century were historically important, but the presence of\r\nvery many archaic words makes them now difficult to read. But in\r\nEngland, from the appearance in 1551 of the English version of Sir\r\nThomas More's _Utopia_, [Footnote: Originally published in Latin\r\nin 1516.] a representation of an ideal state, to the publication of\r\nMilton's grandiose epic, _Paradise Lost_, in 1667, there was a\r\ncontinuity of great literature. There were Cranmer's Book of Common\r\nPrayer and the King James Version of the Bible; Edmund Spenser's\r\ngraceful _Faerie Queene_; [Footnote: For its scenery and mechanism, the\r\nOrlando Furioso of Ariosto furnished the framework; and it similarly\r\nshows the influence of Tasso.] the supreme Shakespeare; Ben Jonson and\r\nMarlowe; Francis Bacon and Richard Hooker; Thomas Hobbes and Jeremy\r\nTaylor; and the somber Milton himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEGINNINGS OF MODERN NATURAL SCIENCE\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Two-fold Development of Culture, Science and Art]\r\n\r\nHuman civilization, or culture, always depends upon progress in two\r\ndirections--the reason, and the feelings or emotions. Art is the\r\nexpression of the latter, and science of the former. Every great period\r\nin the world's history, therefore, is marked by a high appreciation of\r\naesthetics and an advance in knowledge. To this general rule, the\r\nsixteenth century was no exception, for it was distinguished not only\r\nby a wonderful development of architecture, sculpture, painting,\r\nengraving, music, and literature,--whether Roman, Greek, or\r\nvernacular,--but it is the most obvious starting point of our modern\r\nideas of natural and experimental science.\r\n\r\nNowadays, we believe that science is at once the legitimate means and\r\nthe proper goal of the progress of the race, and we fill our school\r\ncurricula with scientific studies. But this spirit is essentially\r\nmodern: it owes its chief stimulus to important achievements in the\r\nsixteenth century and the first half of the seventeenth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Characteristics of the Sixteenth Century]\r\n\r\nFive elements contributed to impress the period that we are now\r\nreviewing with a scientific character. In the first place, the\r\nhumanists encouraged a critical spirit in comparing and contrasting\r\nancient manuscripts and in investigating the history of the distant\r\npast; and their discovery and application of pagan writings served to\r\nbring clearly and abruptly before the educated people of the sixteenth\r\ncentury all that the Greeks and Romans had done in astronomy, physics,\r\nmathematics, and medicine, as well as in philosophy, art, and\r\nliterature. Secondly, the invention of printing itself was a scientific\r\nfeat, and its extended use enabled scientists, no less than artists,\r\nimmediately to acquaint the whole civilized world with their ideas and\r\ndemonstrations.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the marvelous maritime discoveries of new routes to India and\r\nof a new world, which revolutionized European commerce, added much to\r\ngeographical knowledge and led to the construction of scientific maps\r\nof the earth's surface. Fourthly, the painstaking study of a small\r\ngroup of scholars afforded us our first glimpse of the real character\r\nof the vast universe about our own globe--the scientific basis of\r\nmodern astronomy. Lastly, two profound thinkers, early in the\r\nseventeenth century,--Francis Bacon and Descartes,--pointed out new\r\nways of using the reason--the method of modern science.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier chapter, an account has been given of the maritime\r\ndiscoveries of the sixteenth century and their immediate results in\r\nbroadening intellectual interests. In this chapter, some attention\r\nalready has been devoted to the rise of humanism and likewise to the\r\ninvention of printing. It remains, therefore, to say a few words about\r\nthe changes in astronomy and in scientific method that characterized\r\nthe beginning of modern times.\r\n\r\n[Side Note: Astronomy]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1500 the average European knew something about the universe\r\nof sun, moon, planets, and stars, but it was scarcely more than the\r\nancient Greeks had known, and its chief use was to foretell the future.\r\nThis practical aspect of astronomy was a curious ancient misconception,\r\nwhich now passes under the name of astrology. It was popularly believed\r\nprior to the sixteenth century that every heavenly body exerted a\r\ndirect and arbitrary influence upon human character and events,\r\n[Footnote: Disease was attributed to planetary influence. This\r\nconnection between medicine and astrology survives in the sign of\r\nJupiter 4, which still heads medicinal prescriptions.] and that by\r\ncasting \"horoscopes,\" showing just how the stars appeared at the birth\r\nof any person, the subsequent career of such an one might be foreseen.\r\nMany silly notions and superstitions grew up about astrology, yet the\r\npractice persisted. Charles V and Francis I, great rivals in war, vied\r\nwith each other in securing the services of most eminent astrologers,\r\nand Catherine de' Medici never tired of reading horoscopes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The Ptolemaic System\"]\r\n\r\nThroughout the middle ages the foremost scholars had continued to\r\ncherish the astronomical knowledge of the Greeks, which had been\r\nconveniently collected and systematized by a celebrated mathematician\r\nand scholar living in Egypt in the second century of the Christian era\r\n--Ptolemy by name. Among other theories and ideas, Ptolemy taught that\r\nthe earth is the center of the universe, that revolving about it are\r\nthe moon, Mercury, Venus, the sun, the other planets, and the fixed\r\nstars, and that the entire machine is turned with incredible velocity\r\ncompletely around every twenty-four hours. This so-called Ptolemaic\r\nsystem of astronomy fitted in very nicely with the language of the\r\nBible and with the popular prejudice that the earth remains stationary\r\nwhile the heavenly bodies daily rise and set. It was natural that for\r\nmany centuries the Christians should accept the views of Ptolemy as\r\nalmost divinely inspired.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The Copernican System\"]\r\n\r\nHowever, a contradictory theory of the solar system was propounded and\r\nupheld in the sixteenth century, quite supplanting the Ptolemaic theory\r\nin the course of the seventeenth. The new system is called Copernican\r\nafter its first modern exponent--and its general acceptance went far to\r\nannihilate astrology and to place astronomy upon a rational basis.\r\n\r\nCopernicus [the Latin form of his real name, Koppernigk (1473-1543)]\r\nwas a native of Poland, who divided his time between official work for\r\nthe Catholic Church and private researches in astronomy. It was during\r\na ten-year sojourn in Italy (1496-1505), studying canon law and\r\nmedicine, and familiarizing himself, through humanistic teachers, with\r\nancient Greek astronomers, that Copernicus was led seriously to\r\nquestion the Ptolemaic system and to cast about in search of a truthful\r\nsubstitute. Thenceforth for many years he studied and reflected, but it\r\nwas not until the year of his death (1543) that his results were\r\npublished to the world. His book--_On the Revolutions of the\r\nCelestial Bodies_, dedicated to Pope Paul III--offered the theory\r\nthat the earth is not the center of the universe but simply one of a\r\nnumber of planets which revolve about the sun. The earth seemed much\r\nless important in the Copernican universe than in the Ptolemaic.\r\n\r\nThe Copernican thesis was supported and developed by two distinguished\r\nastronomers at the beginning of the next century--Kepler (1571-1630)\r\nand Galileo (1564-1642), one a German, the other an Italian. Kepler\r\ntaught astronomy for a number of years at Gratz and subsequently made\r\nhis home in Prague, where he acquired a remarkable collection of\r\ninstruments [Footnote: From Tycho Brahe, whose assistant he was in\r\n1600-1601.] that enabled him to conduct numerous interesting\r\nexperiments. While he entertained many fantastic and mystical theories\r\nof the \"harmony of the spheres\" and was not above casting horoscopes\r\nfor the emperor and for Wallenstein, that soldier of fortune,\r\n[Footnote: See below, pp. 223, 226.] he nevertheless established\r\nseveral of the fundamental laws of modern astronomy, such as those\r\ngoverning the form and magnitude of the planetary orbits. It was Kepler\r\nwho made clear that the planets revolve about the sun in elliptical\r\nrather than in strictly circular paths.\r\n\r\nGalileo popularized the Copernican theory. [Footnote: Another\r\n\"popularizer\" was Giordano Bruno (c. 1548-1600).] His charming lectures\r\nin the university of Padua, where he taught from 1592 to 1610, were so\r\nlargely attended that a hall seating 2000 had to be provided. In 1609\r\nhe perfected a telescope, which, although hardly more powerful than a\r\npresent-day opera glass, showed unmistakably that the sun was turning\r\non its axis, that Jupiter was attended by revolving moons, and that the\r\nessential truth of the Copernican system was established. Unfortunately\r\nfor Galileo, his enthusiastic desire to convert the pope immediately to\r\nhis own ideas got him into trouble with the Roman Curia and brought\r\nupon him a prohibition from further writing. Galileo submitted like a\r\nloyal Catholic to the papal decree, but had he lived another hundred\r\nyears, he would have rejoiced that almost all men of learning--popes\r\nincluded--had come to accept his own conclusions. Thus modern astronomy\r\nwas suggested by Copernicus, developed by Kepler, and popularized by\r\nGalileo.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of sound knowledge in astronomy and likewise in every\r\nother science rests primarily upon the observation of natural facts or\r\nphenomena and then upon deducing rational conclusions from such\r\nobservation. Yet this seemingly simple rule had not been continuously\r\nand effectively applied in any period of history prior to the sixteenth\r\ncentury. The scientific method of most of the medieval as well as of\r\nthe ancient scholars was essentially that of Aristotle. [Footnote:\r\nException to this sweeping generalization must be made in favor of\r\nseveral medieval scientists and philosophers, including--Roger Bacon, a\r\nFranciscan friar of the thirteenth century.] This so-called deductive\r\nmethod of Aristotle assumed as a starting-point some general of\r\nprinciple as a premise or hypothesis and thence proceeded, by logical\r\nreasoning, to deduce concrete applications or consequences. It had been\r\nextremely valuable in stimulating the logical faculties and in showing\r\nmen how to draw accurate conclusions, but it had shown a woeful\r\ninability to devise new general principles. It evolved an elaborate\r\ntheology and a remarkable philosophy, but natural experimental science\r\nprogressed relatively little until the deductive method of Aristotle\r\nwas supplemented by the inductive method of Francis Bacon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Modern Method of Science: Introduction. Francis Bacon]\r\n\r\nAristotle was partially discredited by radical humanists, who made fun\r\nof the medieval scholars who had taken him most seriously, and by the\r\nProtestant reformers, who assailed the Catholic theology which had been\r\ncarefully constructed by Aristotelian deduction. But it was reserved\r\nfor Francis Bacon, known as Lord Bacon (1561-1626), to point out all\r\nthe shortcomings of the ancient method and to propose a practicable\r\nsupplement. A famous lawyer, lord chancellor of England under James I,\r\na born scientist, a brilliant essayist, he wrote several philosophical\r\nworks of first-rate importance, of which the _Advancement of\r\nLearning_ (1604) and the _Novum Organum_ (1620) are the most\r\nfamous. It is in these works that he summed up the faults which the\r\nwidening of knowledge in his own day was disclosing in ancient and\r\nmedieval thought and set forth the necessity of slow laborious\r\nobservation of facts as antecedent to the assumption of any general\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Descartes]\r\n\r\nWhat of scientific method occurred to Lord Bacon appealed even more to\r\nthe intellectual genius of the Frenchman Descartes (1596-1660). A\r\ncurious combination of sincere practicing Catholic and of original\r\ndaring rationalist was this man, traveling all about Europe, serving as\r\na soldier in the Netherlands, in Bavaria, in Hungary, living in\r\nHolland, dying in Sweden, with a mind as restless as his body. Now\r\ninterested in mathematics, now in philosophy, presently absorbed in\r\nphysics or in the proof of man's existence, throughout his whole career\r\nhe held fast to the faith that science depends not upon the authority\r\nof books but upon the observation of facts. \"Here are my books,\" he\r\ntold a visitor, as he pointed to a basket of rabbits that he was about\r\nto dissect. The _Discourse on Method_ (1637) and the _Principles\r\nof Philosophy_ (1644), taken in conjunction with Bacon's work,\r\nushered in a new scientific era, to some later phases of which we shall\r\nhave occasion to refer in subsequent chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL READING\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RENAISSANCE.

X. Kraus,\r\n_Geschichte der christlichen Kunst_, 2 vols. in 4 (1896-1908), a\r\nmonumental work of great interest and importance, by a German Catholic.\r\n\r\nHUMANISM. The best description of the rise and spread of humanism is J.\r\nE. Sandys, _A History of Classical Scholarship_, Vol. II (1908). For\r\nthe spirit of early humanism see H. C. Hollway-Calthrop, _Petrarch: his\r\nLife and Times_ (1907); J. H. Robinson and H. W. Rolfe, _Petrarch, the\r\nFirst Modern Scholar and Man of Letters_, 2d ed.

Strauss, _Ulrich von Hutten, his Life and Times_,\r\ntrans. by Mrs. G. Sturge (1874), gives a good account of the whole\r\nhumanistic movement and treats Hutten very sympathetically; _The\r\nLetters of Obscure Men_, to which Hutten contributed, were published,\r\nwith English translation, by F. G. Stokes in 1909. An excellent edition\r\nof _The Utopia_ of Sir Thomas More, the famous English humanist, is\r\nthat of George Sampson (1910), containing also an English translation\r\nand the charming contemporary _Biography_ by More's son-in-law, William\r\nRoper. The standard summary of the work of the humanists is the German\r\nwriting of Georg Voigt, _Die Wiederbelebung des classischen\r\nAlterthums_, 3d ed., 2 vols. (1893). Interesting extracts from the\r\nwritings of a considerable variety of humanists are translated by\r\nMerrick Whitcomb in his _Literary Source Books_ of the Renaissance in\r\nGermany and in Italy (1898-1899).\r\n\r\nINVENTION OF PRINTING.

In the European group of national states, France was the\r\nmost important. Politically the French evolved a form of absolutist\r\ndivine-right monarchy, which became the pattern of all European\r\nmonarchies, that of England alone excepted. In international affairs\r\nthe reigning family of France--the Bourbon dynasty after a long\r\nstruggle succeeded in humiliating the rulers of Spain and of Austria--\r\nthe Habsburg dynasty. The hegemony which, in the sixteenth century,\r\nSpain had exercised in the newly established state-system of Europe was\r\nnow supplanted by that of France. Intellectually, too, Italian\r\nleadership yielded to French, until France set the fashion alike in\r\nmanners, morals, and art. Only in the sphere of commerce and trade and\r\nexploitation of lands beyond the seas was French supremacy questioned,\r\nand there not by declining Portugal or Spain but by the vigorous\r\nEnglish nation. France, victorious in her struggle for dynastic\r\naggrandizement on the continent of Europe, was destined to suffer\r\ndefeat in her efforts to secure colonies in Asia and America.\r\n\r\nThis period of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was marked\r\nlikewise by the constant decay of old political and social institutions\r\nin Italy and in Germany, by the gradual decline of the might and\r\nprestige of the Ottoman Turks, and by the extinction of the ancient\r\nkingdom of Poland. In their place appeared as great world powers the\r\nnorthern monarchies of Prussia and Russia, whose royal lines--\r\nHohenzollerns and Romanovs--were to vie in ambition and prowess, before\r\nthe close of the period, with Habsburgs and Bourbons.\r\n\r\nSocially, the influence of nobles and clergy steadily declined. As\r\nsteadily arose the numbers, the ability, and the importance of the\r\ntraders and commercial magnates, the moneyed people, all those who were\r\nidentified with the new wealth that the Commercial Revolution was\r\ncreating, the lawyers, the doctors, the professors, the merchants,--the\r\nso-called middle class, the _bourgeoisie_, who gradually grew\r\ndiscontented with the restrictive institutions of their time. Within\r\nthe _bourgeoisie_ was the seed of revolution: they would one day in\r\ntheir own interests overturn monarchy, nobility, the Church, the whole\r\nsocial fabric. That was to be the death-knell of the old regime--the\r\nannunciation of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE GROWTH OF ABSOLUTISM IN FRANCE AND THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN BOURBONS\r\nAND HABSBURGS, 1589-1661\r\n\r\n\r\nGROWTH OF ABSOLUTISM IN FRANCE: HENRY IV, RICHELIEU, AND MAZARIN\r\n\r\nFor the first time in many years France in 1598 was at peace. The Edict\r\nof Nantes, which in that year accorded qualified religious toleration\r\nto the Huguenots, removed the most serious danger to internal order,\r\nand the treaty of Vervins, concluded in the same year with the king of\r\nSpain, put an end to a long and exhausting foreign war. Henry IV was\r\nnow free to undertake the internal reformation of his country.\r\n\r\nSorry, indeed, was the plight of France at the close of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. Protracted civil and foreign wars had produced their\r\ninevitable consequences. The state was nearly bankrupt. Country\r\ndistricts lay largely uncultivated. Towns were burned or abandoned.\r\nRoads were rough and neglected, and bridges in ruins. Many of the\r\ndischarged soldiers turned highwaymen, pillaged farmhouses, and robbed\r\ntravelers. Trade was at a standstill and the artisans of the cities\r\nwere out of work. During the wars, moreover, great noblemen had taken\r\nmany rights into their own hands and had acquired a habit of not\r\nobeying the king. The French crown seemed to be in danger of losing\r\nwhat power it had gained in the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nThat the seventeenth century was to witness not a diminution but a\r\npronounced increase of royal power, was due to the character of the\r\nFrench king at this critical juncture. Henry IV (1589-1610) was strong\r\nand vivacious. With his high forehead, sparkling eyes, smiling mouth,\r\nand his neatly pointed beard (_Henri quatre_), he was\r\nprepossessing in looks, while his affability, simplicity, and constant\r\nexpression of interest in the welfare of his subjects earned him the\r\nappellation of \"Good King Henry.\" His closest companions knew that he\r\nwas selfish and avaricious, but that his quick decisions were likely to\r\nbe good and certain to be put in force. Above all, Henry had soldierly\r\nqualities and would brook no disloyalty or disobedience.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sully]\r\n\r\nThroughout his reign, Henry IV was well served by his chief minister,\r\nthe duke of Sully, [Footnote: 1560-1641.] an able, loyal, upright\r\nHuguenot, though avaricious like the king and subject to furious fits\r\nof jealousy and temper. Appointed to the general oversight of financial\r\naffairs, Sully made a tour of inspection throughout the country and\r\ncompletely reformed the royal finances. He forbade provincial governors\r\nto raise money on their own authority, removed many abuses of tax-\r\ncollecting, and by an honest, rigorous administration was able between\r\n1600 and 1610 to save an average of a million livres a year. The king\r\nzealously upheld Sully's policy of retrenchment: he reduced the\r\nsubsidies to artists and the grants to favorites, and retained only a\r\nsmall part of his army, sufficient to overawe rebellious nobles and to\r\nrestore order and security throughout the realm. To promote and\r\npreserve universal peace, he even proposed the formation of a World\r\nConfederation--his so-called \"Grand Design\"--which, however, came to\r\nnaught through the mutual jealousies and rival ambitions of the various\r\nEuropean sovereigns. It proved to be much too early to talk\r\nconvincingly of general pacifism and disarmament.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Agricultural Development]\r\n\r\nWhile domestic peace was being established and provision was being made\r\nfor immediate financial contingencies, Henry IV and his great minister\r\nwere both laboring to increase the resources of their country and\r\nthereby to promote the prosperity and contentment of the people. Sully\r\nbelieved that the true wealth of the nation lay in farming pursuits,\r\nand, therefore, agriculture should be encouraged even, if necessary, to\r\nthe neglect of trade and industry. While the king allowed Sully to\r\ndevelop the farming interests, he himself encouraged the new commercial\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nIn order to promote agriculture, Sully urged the abolition of interior\r\ncustoms lines and the free circulation of grain, subsidized stock\r\nraising, forbade the destruction of the forests, drained swamps,\r\nrebuilt the roads and bridges, and planned a vast system of canals.\r\n\r\nOn his side, Henry IV was contributing to the wealth of the middle\r\nclass. It was he who introduced silkworms and the mulberry trees, on\r\nwhich they feed, thereby giving an impetus to the industry which is now\r\none of the most important in France. The beginnings of the industrial\r\nimportance of Paris, Lyons, and Marseilles date from the reign of Henry\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nThe king likewise encouraged commerce. A French merchant marine was\r\nbuilt up by means of royal bounties. A navy was started. Little by\r\nlittle the French began to compete for trade on the high seas at first\r\nwith the Dutch, and subsequently with the English. French trading posts\r\nwere established in India; and Champlain was dispatched to the New\r\nWorld to lay the foundations of a French empire in America. It was\r\nfortunate for France that she had two men like Henry IV and Sully, each\r\nsupplementing the work of the other.\r\n\r\nThe assassination of Henry IV by a crazed fanatic in 1610 threatened\r\nfor a time to nullify the effects of his labors, for supreme power\r\npassed to his widow, Marie de' Medici, an ambitious but incompetent\r\nwoman, who dismissed Sully and undertook to act as regent for her nine-\r\nyear-old son, Louis XIII. The queen-regent was surrounded by worthless\r\nfavorites and was hated by the Huguenots, who feared her rigid\r\nCatholicism, and by the nobles, Catholic and Huguenot alike, who were\r\ndetermined to maintain their privileges and power.\r\n\r\nThe hard savings of Henry IV were quickly exhausted, and France once\r\nmore faced a financial crisis. In this emergency the Estates-General\r\nwas again convened (1614). Since the accession of Louis XI (1461), the\r\nFrench monarchs with their absolutist tendencies had endeavored to\r\nremove this ancient check upon their authority: they had convoked it\r\nonly in times of public confusion or economic necessity. Had the\r\nEstates-General really been an effective body in 1614, it might have\r\ntaken a position similar to that of the seventeenth-century Parliament\r\nin England and established constitutional government in France, but its\r\norganization and personnel militated against such heroic action. The\r\nthree estates--clergy, nobles, and commoners (bourgeois)--sat\r\nseparately in as many chambers; the clergy and nobles would neither tax\r\nthemselves nor cooperate with the Third Estate; the commoners, many of\r\nwhom were Huguenots, were disliked by the court, despised by the First\r\nand Second Estates, and quite out of sympathy with the peasants, the\r\nbulk of the French nation. It is not surprising, under the\r\ncircumstances, that the session of 1614 lasted but three weeks and\r\nended as a farce: the queen-regent locked up the halls and sent the\r\nrepresentatives home--she needed the room for a dance, she said. It was\r\nnot until the momentous year of 1789--after a lapse of 175 years--that\r\nthe Estates-General again assembled.\r\n\r\nAfter the fiasco of 1614, affairs went from bad to worse. Nobles and\r\nHuguenots contended between themselves, and both against the court\r\nfavorites. As many as five distinct uprisings occurred. Marie de'\r\nMedici was forced to relinquish the government, but Louis XIII, on\r\nreaching maturity, gave evidence of little executive ability. The king\r\nwas far more interested in music and hunting than in business of state.\r\nNo improvement appeared until Cardinal Richelieu assumed the guidance\r\nof affairs of state in 1624. Henceforth, the royal power was exercised\r\nnot so much by Louis XIII as by his great minister.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cardinal Richelieu]\r\n\r\nBorn of a noble family of Poitou, Armand de Richelieu (1585-1642), at\r\nthe age of twenty-one had been appointed bishop of the small diocese of\r\nLuçon. His eloquence and ability as spokesman for the clergy in the\r\nfatuous Estates-General of 1614 attracted the notice of Marie de'\r\nMedici, who invited him to court, gave him a seat in the royal council,\r\nand secured his nomination as a cardinal of the Roman Church. From 1624\r\nuntil his death in 1642, Richelieu was the most important man in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nWith undoubted loyalty and imperious will, with the most delicate\r\ndiplomacy and all the blandishments of subtle court intrigue, sometimes\r\nwith sternest and most merciless cruelty, Richelieu maintained his\r\ninfluence over the king and proceeded to destroy the enemies of the\r\nFrench crown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Richelieu's Policies]\r\n\r\nRichelieu's policies were quite simple: (1) To make the royal power\r\nsupreme in France; (2) to make France predominant in Europe. The first\r\ninvolved the removal of checks upon royal authority and the triumph of\r\nabsolutism; the second meant a vigorous foreign policy, leading to the\r\nhumiliation of the rival Habsburgs. In both these policies Richelieu\r\nwas following the general traditions of the preceding century,\r\nessentially those of Henry IV, but to an exaggerated extent and with\r\nunparalleled success. Postponing consideration of general European\r\naffairs, let us first see what the great cardinal accomplished in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disappearance of Representative Government]\r\n\r\nFirst of all, Richelieu disregarded the Estates-General. He was\r\nconvinced of its futility and unhesitatingly declined to consult it.\r\nGradually the idea became current that the Estates-General was an out-\r\nworn, medieval institution, totally unfit for modern purposes, and that\r\nofficial business could best--and therefore properly--be conducted, not\r\nby the representatives of the chief social classes in the nation, but\r\nby personal appointees of the king. Thus the royal council became the\r\nsupreme lawmaking and administrative body in the country.\r\n\r\nLocal estates, or parliaments, continued to exist in certain of the\r\nmost recently acquired provinces of France, such as Brittany, Provence,\r\nBurgundy, and Languedoc, but they had little influence except in\r\napportioning taxes: Richelieu tampered with their privileges and vetoed\r\nmany of their acts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Royal Army]\r\n\r\nThe royal prerogative extended not only to matters of taxation and\r\nlegislation, including the right to levy taxes and to make expenditures\r\nfor any purpose without public accounting, but it was preserved and\r\nenforced by means of a large standing army, which received its pay and\r\nits orders exclusively from the crown. To the royal might, as well as\r\nto its right, Richelieu contributed. He energetically aided Louis XIII\r\nin organizing and equipping what proved to be the best army in Europe.\r\n\r\nTwo factions in the state aroused the cardinal's ire--one the\r\nHuguenots, and the other the nobles--for both threatened the autocracy\r\nwhich he was bent upon erecting. Both factions suffered defeat and\r\nhumiliation at his hands.\r\n\r\nRichelieu, though a cardinal of the Roman Church, was more politician\r\nand statesman than ecclesiastic; though living in an age of religious\r\nfanaticism, he was by no means a bigot. As we shall presently see, this\r\nCatholic cardinal actually gave military support to Protestants in\r\nGermany--for political purposes; it was similarly for political\r\npurposes that he attacked the Protestants in France.\r\n\r\nAs has already been pointed out, French Protestantism meant an\r\ninfluential political party as well as a religion. Since Henry IV had\r\nissued the Edict of Nantes, the Huguenots had had their own assemblies,\r\nofficers, judges, and even certain fortified towns, all of which\r\ninterfered with the sovereign authority and impaired that uniformity\r\nwhich thoughtful royalists believed to be the very cornerstone of\r\nabsolutism. Richelieu had no desire to deprive the Huguenots of\r\nreligious freedom, but he was resolved that in political matters they\r\nshould obey the king. Consequently, when they revolted in 1625, he\r\ndetermined to crush them. In spite of the considerable aid which\r\nEngland endeavored to give them, the Huguenots were entirely subdued.\r\nRichelieu's long siege of La Rochelle, lasting nearly fifteen months,\r\nshowed his forceful resolution. When the whole country had submitted,\r\nthe Edict of Alais was published (1629), leaving to the Protestants\r\nfreedom of conscience and of worship but depriving them of their\r\nfortifications and forbidding them to hold assemblies. Public office\r\nwas still open to them and their representatives kept their judicial\r\nposts. \"The honest Huguenot retained all that he would have been\r\nwilling to protect with his life, while the factious and turbulent\r\nHuguenot was deprived of the means of embarrassing the government.\"\r\n\r\nThe repression of the nobles was a similar statesmanlike achievement,\r\nand one made in the face of redoubtable opposition. It had long been\r\ncustomary to name noblemen as governors of the various provinces, but\r\nthe governors had gradually become masters instead of administrators:\r\nthey commanded detachments of the army; they claimed allegiance of the\r\ngarrisons in their towns; they repeatedly and openly defied the royal\r\nwill. The country, moreover, was sprinkled with noblemen's castles or\r\n_châteaux_, protected by fortifications and armed retainers,\r\nstanding menaces to the prompt execution of the king's orders. Finally,\r\nthe noblemen at court, jealous of the cardinal's advancement and\r\nspurred on by the intrigues of the disaffected Marie de' Medici or of\r\nthe king's own brother, hampered the minister at every turn. Of such\r\nintolerable conditions, Richelieu determined to be quit.\r\n\r\nInto the ranks of noble courtiers, Richelieu struck terror. By means of\r\nspies and trickery, he ferreted out conspiracies and arbitrarily put\r\ntheir leaders to death. Every attempt at rebellion was mercilessly\r\npunished, no matter how exalted in rank the rebel might be. Richelieu\r\nwas never moved by entreaties or threats--he was as inexorable as fate\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Demolition of Private Fortifications ]\r\n\r\nThe cardinal did not confine his attention to noblemen at court. As\r\nearly as 1626 he published an edict ordering the immediate demolition\r\nof all fortified castles not needed for defense against foreign\r\ninvasion. In carrying this edict into force, Richelieu found warm\r\nsupporters in peasantry and townsfolk who had long suffered from the\r\nexactions and depredations of their noble but warlike neighbors. The\r\nruins of many a _chateau_ throughout modern France bear eloquent\r\nwitness to the cardinal's activity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Centralization of Administration]\r\n[Sidenote: The Intendants]\r\n\r\nAnother enduring monument to Richelieu was the centralization of French\r\nadministration. The great minister was tired of the proud, independent\r\nbearing of the noble governors. Without getting rid of them altogether,\r\nhe checked these proud officials by transferring most of their powers\r\nto a new kind of royal officer, the intendant. Appointed by the crown\r\nusually from among the intelligent, loyal middle class, each intendant\r\nhad charge of a certain district, supervising therein the assessment\r\nand collection of royal taxes, the organization of local police or\r\nmilitia, the enforcement of order, and the conduct of courts. These\r\nintendants, with their wide powers of taxation, police, and justice,\r\nwere later dubbed, from their approximate number, the \"thirty tyrants\"\r\nof France. But they owed their positions solely to the favor of the\r\ncrown; they were drawn from a class whose economic interests were long\r\nand well served by the royal power; and their loyalty to the king,\r\ntherefore, could be depended upon. The intendants constantly made\r\nreports to, and received orders from, the central government at Paris.\r\nThey were so many eyes, all over the kingdom, for an ever-watchful\r\nRichelieu. And in measure as the power of the _bourgeois_\r\nintendants increased, that of the noble governors diminished, until, by\r\nthe eighteenth century, the offices of the latter had become largely\r\nhonorary though still richly remunerative. To keep the nobles amused\r\nand in money, and thereby out of mischief and politics, became, from\r\nRichelieu's time, a maxim of the royal policy in France.\r\n\r\n[Side Note: Richelieu's Significance]\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief, was the work of this grim figure that moved across the\r\nstage at a critical period in French history. Richelieu, more than any\r\nother man, was responsible for the assurance of absolutism in his\r\ncountry at the very time when England, by means of revolution and\r\nbloodshed, was establishing parliamentary government; and, as we shall\r\nsoon see, his foreign policy covered France with European glory and\r\nprestige.\r\n\r\nIn person, Richelieu was frail and sickly, yet when clothed in his\r\ncardinal's red robes he appeared distinguished and commanding. His\r\npale, drawn face displayed a firm determination and an inflexible will.\r\nUnscrupulous, exacting, and without pity, he preserved to the end a\r\nproud faith in his moral strength and in his loyalty to country and to\r\nking.\r\n\r\nRichelieu died in 1642, and the very next year the monarch whom he had\r\nserved so gloriously followed him to the grave, leaving the crown to a\r\nboy of five years--Louis XIV.\r\n\r\n[Side Note: Minority of Louis XIV]\r\n[Sidenote: Cardinal Mazarin]\r\n\r\nThe minority of Louis XIV might have been disastrous to France and to\r\nthe royal power, had not the strong policies of Richelieu been\r\nexemplified and enforced by another remarkable minister and cardinal,\r\nMazarin. Mazarin (1602-1661) was an Italian, born near Naples, educated\r\nfor an ecclesiastical career at Rome and in Spain. In the discharge of\r\nseveral delicate diplomatic missions for the pope, he had acted as\r\nnuncio at Paris, where he so ingratiated himself in Richelieu's favor\r\nthat he was invited to enter the service of the king of France, and in\r\n1639 he became a naturalized Frenchman.\r\n\r\nDespite his foreign birth and the fact that he never spoke French\r\nwithout a bad accent, he rose rapidly in public service. He was named\r\ncardinal and was recognized as Richelieu's disciple and imitator. From\r\nthe death of the greater cardinal in 1642 to his own death in 1661,\r\nMazarin actually governed France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Unrest of the Nobles]\r\n\r\nAgainst the Habsburgs, Mazarin continued the great war which Richelieu\r\nhad begun and brought it to a successful conclusion. In domestic\r\naffairs, he encountered greater troubles. The nobles had naturally\r\ntaken umbrage at the vigorous policies of Richelieu, from which Mazarin\r\nseemed to have no thought of departing. They were strengthened,\r\nmoreover, by a good deal of popular dislike of Mazarin's foreign birth,\r\nhis avarice, his unscrupulous plundering of the revenues of the realm\r\nfor the benefit of his own family, and his tricky double-dealing ways.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Fronde]\r\n\r\nThe result was the Fronde, [Footnote: Probably so called from the name\r\nof a street game played by Parisian children and often stopped by\r\npolicemen.] the last attempt prior to the French Revolution to cast off\r\nroyal absolutism in France. It was a vague popular protest coupled with\r\na selfish reaction on the part of the influential nobles: the pretext\r\nwas Mazarin's interference with the parlement of Paris.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Parlements]\r\n\r\nThe parlements were judicial bodies [Footnote: There were thirteen in\r\nthe seventeenth century.] which tried important cases and heard appeals\r\nfrom lower courts. That of Paris, being the most eminent, had, in\r\ncourse of time, secured to itself the right of registering royal\r\ndecrees--that is, of receiving the king's edicts in formal fashion and\r\nentering them upon the statute books so that the law of the land might\r\nbe known generally. From making such a claim, it was only a step for\r\nthe parlement of Paris to refuse to register certain new edicts on the\r\nground that the king was not well informed or that they were in\r\nconflict with older and more binding enactments. If these claims were\r\nsubstantiated, the royal will would be subjected to revision by the\r\nparlement of Paris. To prevent their substantiation, both Louis XIII\r\nand Louis XIV held \"beds of justice\"--that is, appeared in person\r\nbefore the parlement, and from their seat of cushions and pillows\r\ndeclared their will regarding the new edict and directed that it be\r\npromulgated. There were amusing scenes when the boy-king, at the\r\ndirection of Mazarin, gave orders in his shrill treble to the learned\r\nlawyers and grave old judges.\r\n\r\nEgged on by seeming popular sympathy and no doubt by the\r\ncontemporaneous political revolution in England, the parlement of Paris\r\nat length defied the prime minister. It proclaimed its immunity from\r\nroyal control; declared the illegality of any public tax which it had\r\nnot freely and expressly authorized; ordered the abolition of the\r\noffice of intendant; and protested against arbitrary arrest or\r\nimprisonment. To these demands, the people of Paris gave support--\r\nbarricades were erected in the streets, and Mazarin, whose loyal army\r\nwas still fighting in the Germanies, was obliged temporarily to\r\nrecognize the new order. Within six months, however, sufficient troops\r\nhad been collected to enable him to overawe Paris and to annul his\r\nconcessions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Suppression of the Fronde]\r\n[Sidenote: Triumph of Absolutism in France]\r\n\r\nSubsequent uprisings, engineered by prominent noblemen, were often more\r\nhumorous than harmful. To be sure, no less a commander than the great\r\nCondé, one of the chief heroes of the Thirty Years' War, took arms\r\nagainst the Cardinalists, as Mazarin's party was called, but so slight\r\nwas the aid which he received from the French people that he was\r\nspeedily driven from his country and joined the Spanish army. The\r\nupshot of the Fronde was (1) the nobility were more discredited than\r\never; (2) the parlement was forbidden to devote attention to political\r\nor financial affairs; (3) Paris was disarmed and lost the right of\r\nelecting its own municipal officers; (4) the royal authority was even\r\nstronger than under Richelieu because an unsuccessful attempt had been\r\nmade to weaken it. Henry IV, Richelieu, and Mazarin had made straight\r\nthe way for the despotism of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUGGLE BETWEEN BOURBONS AND HABSBURGS THE THIRTY YEARS' WAR\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dynastic Character of Wars in the Seventeenth Century.]\r\n\r\nEvery European country, except England, was marked in the seventeenth\r\ncentury by a continued growth of monarchical power. The kings were\r\nbusily engaged in strengthening their hold upon their respective states\r\nand in reaching out for additional lands and wealth. International\r\nwars, therefore, assumed the character of struggles for dynastic\r\naggrandizement. How might this or that royal family obtain wider\r\nterritories and richer towns? There was certainly sufficient national\r\nlife in western Europe to make the common people proud of their\r\nnationality; hence the kings could normally count upon popular support.\r\nBut wars were undertaken upon the continent of Europe in the\r\nseventeenth century not primarily for national or patriotic motives,\r\nbut for the exaltation of a particular royal family. Citizens of border\r\nprovinces were treated like so many cattle or so much soil that might\r\nbe conveniently bartered among the kings of France, Spain, or Sweden.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Habsburg Dominions in 1600.]\r\n\r\nThis idea had been quite evident in the increase of the Habsburg power\r\nduring the sixteenth century. In an earlier chapter we have noticed how\r\nthat family had acquired one district after another until their\r\nproperty included: (1) Under the Spanish branch--Spain, the Two\r\nSicilies, Milan, Franche Comte, the Belgian Netherlands, Portugal, and\r\na huge colonial empire; (2) Under the Austrian branch--Austria and its\r\ndependencies, Hungary, Bohemia, and the title of Holy Roman Emperor.\r\nDespite the herculean labors of Philip II, France remained outside\r\nHabsburg influence, a big gap in what would otherwise have been a\r\nseries of connected territories.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ambition of the Bourbons.]\r\n\r\nIn measure as the French kings--the Bourbons--strengthened their\r\nposition in their own country, they looked abroad not merely to ward\r\noff foreign attacks but to add land at their neighbors' expense.\r\nRichelieu understood that his two policies went hand in glove--to make\r\nthe Bourbons predominant in Europe was but a corollary to making the\r\nroyal power supreme in France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Thirty Years' War.]\r\n\r\nThe chief warfare of the seventeenth century centers, therefore, in the\r\nlong, terrible conflict between the Habsburgs and the Bourbons. Of this\r\nstruggle, the so-called Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) may be treated as\r\nthe first stage. Let us endeavor to obtain a clear idea of the\r\ninterests involved.\r\n\r\nWhen Richelieu became the chief minister of Louis XIII  (1624), he\r\nfound the Habsburgs in serious trouble and he resolved to take\r\nadvantage of the situation to enhance the prestige of the Bourbons. The\r\nAustrian Habsburgs were facing a vast civil and religious war in the\r\nGermanies, and the Spanish Habsburgs were dispatching aid to their\r\nhard-pressed kinsmen.\r\n\r\nThe war, which proved momentous both to the Habsburgs and to their\r\nenemies, resulted from a variety of reasons--religious, economic, and\r\npolitical.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Thirty Years' War: Ecclesiastical Causes]\r\n\r\nThe peace of Augsburg (1555) had been expected to settle the religious\r\nquestion in the Germanies. But in practice it had failed to fix two\r\nimportant matters. In the first place, the provision forbidding further\r\nsecularization of church property (\"Ecclesiastical Reservation\") was\r\nnot carried out, nor could it be while human nature and human\r\ntemptation remained. Every Catholic ecclesiastic who became Protestant\r\nwould naturally endeavor to take his church lands with him. Then, in\r\nthe second place, the peace had recognized only Catholics and\r\nLutherans: meanwhile the Calvinists had increased their numbers,\r\nespecially in southern and central Germany and in Bohemia, and demanded\r\nequal rights. In order to extort concessions from the emperor, a union\r\nof Protestant princes was formed, containing among its members the\r\nzealous young Calvinist prince of the Palatinate, Frederick, commonly\r\ncalled the Elector Palatine of the Rhine. The Catholics were in an\r\nequally belligerent frame of mind. Not only were they determined to\r\nprevent further secularization of church property, but, emboldened by\r\nthe progress of the Catholic Reformation in the Germanies during the\r\nsecond half of the sixteenth century, they were now anxious to revise\r\nthe earlier religious settlement in their own interest and to regain,\r\nif possible, the lands that had been lost by the Church to the\r\nProtestants. The Catholics relied for political and military support\r\nupon the Catholic Habsburg emperor and upon Maximilian, duke of Bavaria\r\nand head of the Catholic League of Princes. Religiously, the enemies of\r\nthe Habsburgs were the German Protestants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Thirty Years' War: Political Causes]\r\n\r\nBut a hardly less important cause of the Thirty Years' War lay in the\r\npolitics of the Holy Roman Empire. The German princes had greatly\r\nincreased their territories and their wealth during the Protestant\r\nRevolution. They aspired, each and all, to complete sovereignty. They\r\nwould rid themselves of the outworn bonds of a medieval empire and\r\nassume their proper place among the independent and autocratic rulers\r\nof Europe. On his side, the emperor was insistent upon strengthening\r\nhis position and securing a united powerful Germany under his personal\r\ncontrol. Politically, the enemies of the Habsburgs were the German\r\nprinces.\r\n\r\nWith the princes was almost invariably allied any European monarch who\r\nhad anything to gain from dividing Germany or weakening Habsburg\r\ninfluence. In case of a civil war, the Habsburgs might reasonably\r\nexpect to find enemies in Denmark, Sweden, and France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Four Periods in the Thirty Years' War]\r\n\r\nThe war naturally divides itself into four periods: (1) The Bohemian\r\nRevolt; (2) The Danish Period; (3) The Swedish Period; (4) The French\r\nor International Period.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1. The Bohemian Revolt]\r\n\r\nThe signal for the outbreak of hostilities in the Germanics was given\r\nby a rebellion in Bohemia against the Habsburgs. Following the death of\r\nRudolph II (1576-1612), a narrow-minded, art-loving, and unbalanced\r\nrecluse, his childless brother Matthias (1612-1619) had desired to\r\nsecure the succession of a cousin, Ferdinand II (1619-1637), who,\r\nalthough a man of blameless life and resolute character, was known to\r\nbe devoted to the cause of absolutism and fanatically loyal to the\r\nCatholic Church. Little opposition to this settlement was encountered\r\nin the various Habsburg Bohemian dominions, except in Bohemia. In that\r\ncountry, however, the nobles, many of whom were Calvinists, dreaded the\r\nprospective accession of Ferdinand, who would be likely to deprive them\r\nof their special privileges and to impede, if not to forbid, the\r\nexercise of the Protestant religion in their territories. Already there\r\nhad been encroachments on their religious liberty.\r\n\r\nOne day in 1618, a group of Bohemian noblemen broke into the room where\r\nthe imperial envoys were stopping and hurled them out of a window into\r\na castle moat some sixty feet below. This so-called \"defenestration\" of\r\nFerdinand's representatives was followed by the proclamation of the\r\ndethronement of the Habsburgs in Bohemia and the election to the\r\nkingship of Frederick, the Calvinistic Elector Palatine. Frederick was\r\ncrowned at Prague and prepared to defend his new lands. Ferdinand II,\r\nraising a large army in his other possessions, and receiving assistance\r\nfrom Maximilian of Bavaria and the Catholic League as well as from\r\nTuscany and the Spanish Habsburgs, intrusted the allied forces to an\r\nable veteran general, Count Tilly (1559-1632). King Frederick had\r\nexpected support from his father-in-law, James I of England, and from\r\nthe Lutheran princes of northern Germany, but in both respects he was\r\ndisappointed. What with parliamentary quarrels at home and a curiously\r\nmistaken foreign policy of a Spanish alliance, James confined his\r\nassistance to pompous advice and long words. Then, too, most of the\r\nLutheran princes, led by the tactful John George, elector of Saxony,\r\nhoped by remaining neutral to obtain special concessions from the\r\nemperor.\r\n\r\nWithin a very brief period, Tilly subdued Bohemia, drove out Frederick,\r\nand reestablished the Habsburg power. Many rebellious nobles lost their\r\nproperty and lives, and the practice of the Protestant religion was\r\nagain forbidden in Bohemia. Nor was that all. The victorious\r\nimperialists drove the fugitive Frederick, now derisively dubbed the\r\n\"winter king,\" out of his original wealthy possessions on the Rhine,\r\ninto miserable exile, an outcast without land or money. The conquered\r\nPalatinate was turned over to Maximilian of Bavaria, who was further\r\nrewarded for his services by being recognized as an elector of the Holy\r\nRoman Empire in place of the deposed Frederick.\r\n\r\nThe first period of the war was thus favorable to the Habsburg and\r\nCatholic causes. Between 1618 and 1620, revolt had been suppressed in\r\nBohemia and an influential Rhenish electorate had been transferred from\r\nCalvinist to Catholic hands.\r\n\r\nNow, however, the northern Protestant princes took alarm. If they had\r\nviewed with composure the failure of Frederick's foolhardy efforts in\r\nBohemia, they beheld with downright dismay the expansion of Bavaria and\r\nthe destruction of a balance of power long maintained between Catholic\r\nand Protestant Germany. And so long as the ill-disciplined remnants of\r\nFrederick's armies were behaving like highwaymen, pillaging and burning\r\nthroughout the Germanics, the emperor declined to consider the grant of\r\nany concessions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 2. Danish Intervention. Christian IV]\r\n\r\nAt this critical juncture, while the Protestant princes were wavering\r\nbetween obedience and rebellion, Christian IV of Denmark intervened and\r\nprecipitated the second period of the war. Christian IV (1588-1648) was\r\nimpulsive and ambitious: as duke of Holstein he was a member of the\r\nHoly Roman Empire and opposed to Habsburg domination; as king of\r\nDenmark and Norway he was anxious to extend his influence over the\r\nNorth Sea ports; and as a Lutheran, he sought to champion the rights of\r\nhis German co-religionists and to help them retain the rich lands which\r\nthey had appropriated from the Catholic Church. In 1625, therefore,\r\nChristian invaded Germany, supported by liberal grants of money from\r\nEngland and by the troops of many of the German princes, both Calvinist\r\nand Lutheran.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wallenstein]\r\n\r\nAgainst the Danish invasion, Tilly unaided might have had difficulty to\r\nstand, but fortune seemed to have raised up a codefender of the\r\nimperialist cause in the person of an extraordinary adventurer,\r\nWallenstein. This man had enriched himself enormously out of the\r\nrecently confiscated estates of rebellious Bohemians, and now, in order\r\nto benefit himself still further, he secured permission from the\r\nEmperor Ferdinand II to raise an independent army of his own to restore\r\norder in the empire and to expel the Danes. By liberal promises of pay\r\nand plunder, the soldier of fortune soon recruited an army of some\r\n50,000 men, and what a motley collection it was! Italian, Swiss,\r\nSpaniard, German, Pole, Englishman, and Scot,--Protestant was welcomed\r\nas heartily as Catholic,--any one who loved adventure or hoped for\r\ngain, all united by the single tie of loyalty and devotion to\r\nWallenstein. The force was whipped into shape by the undoubted genius\r\nof its commander and at once became an effective machine of war. Yet\r\nthe perpetual plundering of the land, on which it lived, was a constant\r\nsource of reproach to the army of Wallenstein.\r\n\r\nThe campaigning of the second period of the war took place in North\r\nGermany. At Lutter, King Christian IV was defeated overwhelmingly by\r\nthe combined forces of Tilly and Wallenstein, and the Lutheran states\r\nwere left at the mercy of the Catholic League. Brandenburg openly\r\nespoused the imperialist cause and aided Ferdinand's generals in\r\nexpelling the Danish king from German soil. Only the lack of naval\r\ncontrol of the Baltic and North seas prevented the victors from seizing\r\nDenmark. The desperation of Christian and the growingly suspicious\r\nactivity of Sweden resulted in the peace of Lubeck (1629), by which the\r\nking of Denmark was left in possession of Jutland, Schleswig, and\r\nHolstein, but deprived of the German bishoprics which various members\r\nof his family had taken from the Catholic Church.\r\n\r\nFollowing up its successes, the Catholic League prevailed upon the\r\nEmperor Ferdinand II in the same year (1629) to sign the Edict of\r\nRestitution, restoring to the Church all the property that had been\r\nsecularized in violation of the peace of Augsburg of 1555. The edict\r\nwas to be executed by imperial commissioners, all of whom were\r\nCatholics, and so well did they do their work that, within three years\r\nof the promulgation of the edict, Roman Catholicism in the Germanies\r\nhad recovered five bishoprics, thirty Hanse towns, and nearly a hundred\r\nmonasteries, to say nothing of parish churches of which the number can\r\nhardly be estimated.\r\n\r\nSo far, the religious and economic grievances against the Habsburgs had\r\nbeen confined mainly to Calvinists, but now the Lutheran princes were\r\nalarmed. The enforcement of the Edict of Restitution against all\r\nProtestants alike was the signal for an emphatic protest from Lutherans\r\nas well as from Calvinists. A favorable opportunity for intervention\r\nseemed to present itself to the foremost Lutheran power--Sweden. Not\r\nonly were many Protestant princes in Germany in a mood to welcome\r\nforeign assistance against the Catholics, but the emperor was less able\r\nto resist invasion, since in 1630, yielding to the urgent entreaties of\r\nthe Catholic League, he dismissed the plundering and ambitious\r\nWallenstein from his service.\r\n\r\nThe king of Sweden at this time was Gustavus Adolphus (1611-1632), the\r\ngrandson of that Gustavus Vasa who had established both the\r\nindependence and the Lutheranism of his country. Gustavus Adolphus was\r\none of the most attractive figures of his age--in the prime of life,\r\ntall, fair, and blue-eyed, well educated and versed in seven languages,\r\nfond of music and poetry, skilled and daring in war, impetuous, well\r\nbalanced, and versatile. A rare combination of the idealist and the\r\npractical man of affairs, Gustavus Adolphus had dreamed of making\r\nProtestant Sweden the leading power in northern Europe and had\r\nvigorously set to work to achieve his ends. His determination to\r\nencircle the whole Baltic with his own territories--making it literally\r\na Swedish lake--brought him first into conflict with Muscovy, or, as we\r\ncall it today, Russia. Finland and Esthonia were occupied, and Russia\r\nagreed in 1617 to exclusion from the Baltic sea coast. Next a stubborn\r\nconflict with Poland (1621-1629) secured for Sweden the province of\r\nLivonia and the mouth of the Vistula River. Gustavus then turned his\r\nlonging eyes to the Baltic coast of northern Germany, at the very time\r\nwhen the Edict of Restitution promised him aggrieved allies in that\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 3. Swedish Intervention: Gustavus Adolphus]\r\n\r\nIt was likewise at the very time when Cardinal Richelieu had crushed\r\nout all insurrection, whether Huguenot or noble, in France and was\r\nseeking some effective means of prolonging the war in the Germanies to\r\nthe end that the rival Habsburgs might be irretrievably weakened and\r\nhumiliated. He entered into definite alliance with Gustavus Adolphus\r\nand provided him arms and money, for the time asking only that the\r\nProtestant champion accord the liberty of Catholic worship in conquered\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French Aid]\r\n\r\nGustavus Adolphus landed in Pomerania in 1630 and proceeded to occupy\r\nthe chief northern fortresses and to treat for alliances with the\r\ninfluential Protestant electors of Brandenburg and Saxony. While\r\nGustavus tarried at Potsdam, in protracted negotiation with the elector\r\nof Brandenburg, Tilly and the imperialists succeeded, after a long\r\nsiege, in capturing the Lutheran stronghold of Magdeburg (May, 1631).\r\nThe fall of the city was attended by a mad massacre of the garrison,\r\nand of armed and unarmed citizens, in streets, houses, and churches; at\r\nleast 20,000 perished; wholesale plundering and a general conflagration\r\ncompleted the havoc. The sack of Magdeburg evoked the greatest\r\nindignation from the Lutherans. Gustavus Adolphus, now joined by the\r\nelectors of Brandenburg and Saxony and by many other Protestant princes\r\nof northern Germany, advanced into Saxony, where, in September, 1631,\r\nhe avenged the destruction of Magdeburg by defeating decisively the\r\nsmaller army of Tilly on the Breitenfeld, near Leipzig. Then Gustavus\r\nturned southwestward, making for the Rhine valley, with the idea of\r\nforming a union with the Calvinist princes. Only the prompt protest of\r\nhis powerful ally, Richelieu, prevented the rich archbishoprics of\r\nCologne, Trier, and Mainz from passing immediately under Swedish\r\ncontrol. Next Gustavus Adolphus turned east and invaded Bavaria. Tilly,\r\nwho had reassembled his forces, failed to check the invasion and lost\r\nhis life in a battle on the Lech (April, 1632). The victorious Swedish\r\nking now made ready to carry the war into the hereditary dominions of\r\nthe Austrian Habsburgs. As a last resort to check the invader, the\r\nemperor recalled Wallenstein with full power over his freelance army.\r\nAbout the same time the emperor concluded a close alliance with his\r\nkinsman, the ambitious Philip IV of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe memorable contest between the two great generals--Gustavus Adolphus\r\nand Wallenstein--was brought to a tragic close in the late autumn of\r\nthe same year on the fateful field of Lützen. Wallenstein was defeated,\r\nbut Gustavus was killed. Although the Swedes continued the struggle,\r\nthey were comparatively few in numbers and possessed no such general as\r\ntheir fallen king. On the other side, Wallenstein's loyalty could not\r\nbe depended upon; rumors reached the ear of the emperor that his\r\nforemost general was negotiating with the Protestants to make peace on\r\nhis own terms; and Wallenstein was assassinated in his camp by\r\nfanatical imperialists (February, 1634). The tragic removal of both\r\nWallenstein and Gustavus Adolphus, the economic exhaustion of the whole\r\nempire, and the national desire on the part of many Protestant princes,\r\nas well as on the part of the Catholic emperor, to rid the Germanies of\r\nforeign soldiers and foreign influence--all these developments seemed\r\nto point to the possibility of concluding the third, or Swedish, period\r\nof the war, not perhaps as advantageously for the imperialist cause as\r\nhad ended the Bohemian revolt or the Danish intervention, but at any\r\nrate in a spirit of reasonable compromise. In fact, in May, 1635, a\r\ntreaty was signed at Prague between the emperor and such princes as\r\nwere then willing to lay down their arms, whereby all the military\r\nforces in the empire were henceforth to be under the direct control of\r\nthe emperor (with the exception of a contingent under the special\r\ncommand of the Lutheran elector of Saxony); all princely leagues within\r\nthe empire were to be dissolved; mutual restoration of captured\r\nterritory was to be made; and, as to the fundamental question of the\r\nownership of ecclesiastical lands, it was settled that any such lands\r\nactually held in the year 1627, whether acquired before or after the\r\nreligious peace of Augsburg of 1555, should continue so to be held for\r\nforty years or until in each case an amicable arrangement could be\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nWhat wrecked the peace of Prague was not so much the disinclination of\r\nthe Protestant princes of Germany to accept its terms as the policy of\r\nCardinal Richelieu of France. Richelieu was convinced more than ever\r\nthat French greatness depended upon Habsburg defeat; he would not\r\nsuffer the princes to make peace with the emperor until the latter was\r\nsoundly trounced and all Germany devastated; instead of supplying the\r\nSwedes and the German Protestants with assistance from behind the\r\nscenes, he now would come boldly upon the stage and engage the emperor\r\nin open combat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 4. French Intervention. Richelieu's Policy in the Germanies]\r\n\r\nThe final, or French, period of the Thirty Years' War lasted from 1635\r\nto 1648--almost as long as the other three periods put together.\r\nRichelieu entered the war not only to humble the Austrian Habsburgs\r\nand, if possible, to wrest the valuable Rhenish province of Alsace from\r\nthe Holy Roman Empire, but also to strike telling blows at the\r\nContinental supremacy of the Spanish Habsburgs, who, since 1632, had\r\nbeen actively helping their German kinsmen. The Spanish king, it will\r\nbe remembered, still held the Belgian Netherlands, on the northern\r\nfrontier of France, and Franche Comté on the east, while oft-contested\r\nMilan in northern Italy was a Spanish dependency. France was almost\r\nsurrounded by Spanish possessions, and Richelieu naturally declared war\r\nagainst Spain as against the emperor. The wily French cardinal could\r\ncount upon the Swedes and many of the German Protestants to keep the\r\nAustrian Habsburgs busily engaged and upon the assistance of the Dutch\r\nin humbling the Spaniard, for Spain had not yet formally recognized the\r\nindependence of the Dutch Netherlands. Inasmuch as England was chiefly\r\nconcerned with troublesome internal affairs, the enemies of France\r\ncould hardly expect aid from across the Channel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Condé and Turenne]\r\n\r\nAt first, the French suffered a series of military reverses, due in\r\nlarge part to unpreparedness, incompetent commanders, and ill-\r\ndisciplined troops. At one time it looked as if the Spaniards might\r\ncapture Paris. But with unflagging zeal and patriotic devotion,\r\nRichelieu pressed on the war. He raised armies, drilled them, and\r\ndispatched them into the Netherlands, into Alsace, into Franche Comté,\r\ninto northern Italy, and into Roussillon. He stirred up the Portuguese\r\nto revolt and recover their independence (1640). And Mazarin, who\r\nsucceeded him in 1642, preserved his foreign policy intact. Young and\r\nbrilliant generals now appeared at the head of the French forces, among\r\nwhom were the dashing Prince of Condé (1621-1686), and the master\r\nstrategist Turenne (1611-1675), the greatest soldier of his day. The\r\nformer's victory of Rocroi (1643) dated the commencement of the\r\nsupremacy of France in war, a supremacy which was retained for a\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peace of Westphalia (1648)]\r\n\r\nFinally, Turenne's masterly maneuvering against the Spaniards and his\r\nforcible detachment of Maximilian of Bavaria from the imperial alliance\r\nbroke down effective opposition and ended the Thirty Years' War in the\r\nGermanies. The various treaties which were signed in 1648 constituted\r\nthe peace of Westphalia.\r\n\r\nThe political clauses of the peace of Westphalia provided: (1) Each\r\nGerman state was free to make peace or war without consulting the\r\nemperor--each prince was invested with sovereign authority; (2) France\r\nreceived Alsace, except the free city of Strassburg, and was confirmed\r\nin the possession of the bishoprics of Metz, Toul, and Verdun; (3)\r\nSweden was given territory in Pomerania controlling the mouth of the\r\nOder, and the secularized bishopric of Bremen, surrounding the city of\r\nthat name and dominating the mouths of the Elbe and the Weser; (4)\r\nFrance and Sweden received votes in the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire,\r\nwith implied rights to exercise an oversight of German affairs; (5)\r\nBrandenburg secured eastern Pomerania and several bishoprics, including\r\nMagdeburg; (6) The Palatinate was divided between Maximilian of Bavaria\r\nand the son of the deposed Frederick--each bearing the title of\r\nelector; (7) Switzerland and the United Provinces (Holland) were\r\nformally recognized as independent of the empire and of Spain\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nThe religious difficulties were settled as follows: (1) Calvinists were\r\nto share all the privileges of their Lutheran fellow-Protestants; (2)\r\nAll church property was to be secured in the possession of those,\r\nwhether Catholics or Protestants, who held it on 1 January, 1624; (3)\r\nAn equal number of Catholic and Protestant judges were to sit in the\r\nimperial courts. Inasmuch as after 1648 there was little relative\r\nchange of religion in Germany, this religious settlement was\r\npractically permanent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Evil Effects of the Thirty Years' War on Germany]\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking results of the peace of Westphalia was the\r\ncompletion of a long process of political disruption in the Germanies.\r\nOnly the form of the Holy Roman Empire survived. The already shadowy\r\nimperial power became a mere phantom, nor was a change destined to come\r\nuntil, centuries later, the Prussian Hohenzollerns should replace the\r\nAustrian Habsburgs. Meanwhile the weakness of Germany enabled France to\r\nextend her northern boundaries toward the Rhine.\r\n\r\nFar more serious than her political losses were the economic results to\r\nGermany. The Thirty Years' War left Germany almost a desert. \"About\r\ntwo-thirds of the total population had disappeared; the misery of those\r\nthat survived was piteous in the extreme. Five-sixths of the villages\r\nin the empire had been destroyed. We read of one in the Palatinate that\r\nin two years had been plundered twenty-eight times. In Saxony, packs of\r\nwolves roamed about, for in the north quite one-third of the land had\r\ngone out of cultivation, and trade had drifted into the hands of the\r\nFrench or Dutch. Education had almost disappeared; and the moral\r\ndecline of the people was seen in the coarsening of manners and the\r\ngrowth of superstition, as witnessed by frequent burning of witches.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Continuation of War between French Bourbons and Spanish\r\nHapsburgs. Peace of the Pyrenees 1659]\r\n\r\nThe peace of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years' War in the Germanies,\r\nbut it did not stop the bitter contest between France and Spain.\r\nMazarin was determined to secure even greater territorial gains for his\r\ncountry, and, although Condé deserted to Spain, Turenne was more than a\r\nmatch for any commander whom the Spaniards could put in the field.\r\nMazarin, moreover, by ceding the fortress of Dunkirk to the English,\r\nobtained aid from the veteran troops of Cromwell. It was not until 1659\r\nthat, in the celebrated treaty of the Pyrenees, peace was concluded\r\nbetween France and Spain. This provided: (1) France added the province\r\nof Roussillon on her southern frontier and that of Artois on the north;\r\n(2) France was recognized as protector of the duchy of Lorraine; (3)\r\nCondé was pardoned and reinstated in French service; (4) Maria Theresa,\r\neldest daughter of the Spanish Habsburg king, Philip IV, was to marry\r\nthe young French Bourbon king, Louis XIV, and, in consideration of the\r\npayment of a large dowry, was to renounce all claims to the Spanish\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of the Pyrenees was the last important achievement of\r\nCardinal Mazarin. But before he died in 1661 he had the satisfaction of\r\nseeing the triumph of those policies which he had adopted from\r\nRichelieu: the royal power firmly established within France; the\r\nHabsburgs, whether Austrian or Spanish, defeated and humiliated; the\r\nBourbon king of France respected and feared throughout Europe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Development of International Law]\r\n[Sidenote: In Italy]\r\n\r\nNot least among the results of the conflict between Habsburgs and\r\nBourbons was the stimulus given to the acceptance of fixed principles\r\nof international law and of definite usages for international\r\ndiplomacy. In ancient times the existence of the all-embracing Roman\r\nEmpire had militated against the development of international relations\r\nas we know them to-day. In the early middle ages feudal society had\r\nleft little room for diplomacy. Of course, both in ancient times and in\r\nthe middle ages, there had been embassies and negotiations and\r\ntreaties; but the embassies had been no more than temporary missions\r\ndirected to a particular end, and there had been neither permanent\r\ndiplomatic agents nor a professional diplomatic class. To the\r\ndevelopment of such a class the Italy of the fifteenth century had\r\ngiven the first impetus. Northern and central Italy was then filled, as\r\nwe have discovered, with a large number of city-states, all struggling\r\nfor political and economic mastery, all dependent for the maintenance\r\nof a \"balance of power\" upon alliances and counter alliances, all\r\nemploying diplomacy quite as much as war in the game of peninsular\r\npolitics. It was in Italy that there grew up the institution of\r\npassports, the distinction between armed forces and civilians,\r\ninternational comity, and in fact the very notion that states have an\r\ninterest in the observance of law and order among themselves. Of\r\nspecial importance, in this connection, was Venice, which gradually\r\nevolved a regular system of permanent diplomats, and incidentally\r\nobliged her ambassadors to present detailed reports on foreign affairs;\r\nand, because of their commercial preeminence in the Mediterranean, the\r\nVenetians contributed a good deal to the development of rules of the\r\nsea first in time of peace, and subsequently in time of war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In Europe in Sixteenth Century]\r\n\r\nDuring the sixteenth century the Italian ideas of statecraft and inter-\r\nstate relations, ably championed by Machiavelli, were communicated to\r\nthe nations of western Europe. Permanent embassies were established in\r\nforeign countries by the kings of Spain, Portugal, France, and England.\r\nCustoms of international intercourse grew up. Diplomacy became a\r\nrecognized occupation of distinguished statesmen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thirty Years' War and International Law]\r\n\r\nTwo institutions might have thwarted or retarded the development of\r\ninternational law: one was the Catholic Church with its international\r\norganization and its claim to universal spiritual supremacy; the other\r\nwas the Holy Roman Empire, with its claim to temporal predominance and\r\nwith its insistence upon the essential inequality between itself and\r\nall other states. But the Protestant Revolt in the sixteenth century\r\ndealt a severe blow to the claim and power of the Catholic Church. And\r\nthe long struggle between Bourbons and Habsburgs, culminating in the\r\nThirty Years' War, reduced the Holy Roman Empire to a position, in\r\ntheory as well as in fact, certainly no higher than that of the\r\nnational monarchies of France, England, and Spain, or that of the Dutch\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nFrom the treaties of Westphalia emerged a real state-system in Europe,\r\nbased on the theory of the essential equality of independent sovereign\r\nstates, though admitting of the fact that there were Great Powers.\r\nHenceforth the public law of Europe was to be made by diplomats and by\r\ncongresses of ambassadors. Westphalia pointed the new path.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of international relations was emphasized in the first\r\nhalf of the seventeenth century. It was the Thirty Years' War, with its\r\nrevolting cruelty, which brought out the contrast between the more\r\nhumane practice of war as an art in Italy and the savagery which\r\ndisgraced the Germanies. The brutality of the struggle turned thinkers'\r\nattention to the need of formulating rules for the protection of non-\r\ncombatants in time of war, the treatment of the sick and wounded, the\r\nprohibition of wanton pillage and other horrors which shocked the\r\nawakening conscience of seventeenth-century Europe. It was the\r\nstarting-point of the publication of treatises on international law.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Grotius]\r\n\r\nThe first effective work, the one which was destined long to influence\r\nsovereigns and diplomats, was Grotius's _On the Law of War and\r\nPeace_. Hugo Grotius (1583-1645) [Footnote: Known in his native\r\ncountry as Huig van Groot. The last years of his life he spent as\r\nambassador of Sweden at the French court.] was a learned Dutch\r\nhumanist, whose active participation in politics against the stadholder\r\nof the Netherlands and whose strong protests for religious toleration\r\nagainst the dominant orthodox Calvinists of his country combined to\r\nbring upon himself a sentence of life imprisonment. Immured in a Dutch\r\nfortress in 1619, he managed to escape and fled to Paris, where he\r\nprepared and in 1625 published his immortal work. _On the Law of War\r\nand Peace_ is an exhaustive and masterly text-book--the first and\r\none of the best of the systematic treatises on the fundamental\r\nprinciples of international law.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL READING\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY IV, RICHELIEU, AND MAZARIN.

From that date, throughout a\r\nlong reign, Louis was in fact as well as in name ruler of the nation,\r\nand his rule, like that of Napoleon, stands out as a distinct epoch in\r\nFrench history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louis XIV the Heir to Absolutist Tendencies]\r\n\r\nLouis XIV profited by the earlier work of Henry IV, Sully, Richelieu,\r\nand Mazarin. He inherited a fairly compact state, the population of\r\nwhich was patriotic and loyal to the crown. Insurrections of\r\nProtestants or rebellions of the nobles were now things of the past.\r\nThe Estates-General, the ancient form of representative government, had\r\nfallen into disuse and oblivion. Local administration was conducted by\r\nfaithful middle-class officials, the intendants; and all powers of\r\ntaxation, war, public improvements, police, and justice were centered\r\nin the hands of the king. Abroad, the rival Habsburgs had been humbled\r\nand French boundaries had been extended and French prestige heightened.\r\nEverything was in readiness for a great king to practice absolutism on\r\na scale never before realized.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Absolutism. Monarchy by Divine Right]\r\n\r\nThe theories of government upon which the absolutism of Louis XIV was\r\nbased received a classic expression in a celebrated book written by\r\nBossuet (1627-1704), a learned and upright bishop of the time.\r\nGovernment, according to Bossuet, [Footnote: The statements of the\r\narguments in favor of monarchy by divine right are taken from Bossuet's\r\nfamous book, _La politique tirée des propres paroles de l'Ecriture\r\nSainte_.] is divinely ordained in order to enable mankind to satisfy\r\nthe natural instincts of living together in organized society. Under\r\nGod, monarchy is, of all forms of government, the most usual and the\r\nmost ancient, and therefore the most natural: it is likewise the\r\nstrongest and most efficient, therefore the best. It is analogous to\r\nthe rule of a family by the father, and, like that rule, should be\r\nhereditary. Four qualities are referred by the eloquent bishop to such\r\nan hereditary monarch: (1) That he is sacred is attested by his\r\nanointing at the time of coronation by the priests of the Church--it is\r\naccordingly blasphemy and sacrilege to assail the person of the king or\r\nto conspire against him; (2) That he is to provide for the welfare of\r\nhis people and watch over their every activity may be gathered from the\r\nfact that he is, in a very real sense, the father of his people, the\r\npaternal king; (3) His power is absolute and autocratic, and for its\r\nexercise he is accountable to God alone--no man on earth may rightfully\r\nresist the royal commands, and the only recourse for subjects against\r\nan evil king is to pray God that his heart be changed; (4) Greater\r\nreason is given to a king than to any one else--the king is an earthly\r\nimage of God's majesty, and it is wrong, therefore, to look upon him as\r\na mere man. The king is a public person and in him the whole nation is\r\nembodied. \"As in God are united all perfection and every virtue, so all\r\nthe power of all the individuals in a community is united in the person\r\nof the king.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louis XIV]\r\n\r\nSuch was the theory of what is called divine-right monarchy or\r\nabsolutism. It must be remembered that it had been gaining ground\r\nduring the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, until it was accepted\r\npractically by all the French people as well as by most of their\r\nContinental neighbors. Even in England, as we shall presently\r\nsee,[Footnote: See below, pp. 263 ff.] the Stuart kings attempted, for\r\na time with success, to assert and maintain the doctrine. It was a\r\npolitical idea as popular in the seventeenth century as that of\r\ndemocracy is to-day. And Louis XIV was its foremost personification.\r\nSuave, dignified, elegant in manners and speech, the French king played\r\nhis part well; he appeared to have been born and divinely appointed to\r\nthe kingly calling.\r\n\r\nFor a king, Louis worked hard. He was conscientious and painstaking.\r\nDay after day he reviewed the details of administration. Over all\r\nthings he had a watchful eye. Systematically he practiced what he\r\ntermed the \"trade of a king.\" \"One reigns by work and for work,\" he\r\nwrote his grandson.\r\n\r\nNo prince was more fortunate than Louis XIV in his personal advisers\r\nand lieutenants. Not only were his praises proclaimed by the silver-\r\ntongued Bossuet, but he was served by such men as Colbert, the\r\nfinancier and reformer; Louvois, the military organizer; Vauban, the\r\nmaster builder of fortifications; Condé and Turenne, unconquerable\r\ngenerals; and by a host of literary lights, whom he patronized and\r\npensioned, and who cast about his person a glamour of renown. Louis was\r\nhailed as the \"Grand Monarch,\" and his age was appropriately designated\r\nthe Age of Louis the Fourteenth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Versailles and the Court of Louis XIV]\r\n\r\nAt Versailles, some twelve miles from Paris, in the midst of what had\r\nbeen a sandy waste, the Grand Monarch erected those stately palaces,\r\nwith their lavish furnishings, and broad parks and great groves and\r\nmyriads of delightful fountains, which became Europe's pleasure center.\r\nThither were drawn the French nobility, who, if shorn of all political\r\npower, were now exempted from disagreeable taxes and exalted as\r\nessential parts of a magnificent social pageant. The king must have\r\nnoblemen as _valets-de-chambre_, as masters of the wardrobe or of\r\nthe chase or of the revels. Only a nobleman was fit to comb the royal\r\nhair or to dry off the king after a bath. The nobles became, like so\r\nmany chandeliers, mere decorations for the palace. Thus, about\r\nVersailles gathered the court of France, and the leaders of fashion met\r\nthose of brains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The Age of Louis XIV\"]\r\n\r\nIt was a time when French manners, dress, speech, art, literature, and\r\nscience were adopted as the models and property of civilized Europe.\r\nCorneille (1606-1684), the father of the French stage; Molière (1622-\r\n1673), the greatest of French dramatists; Racine (1639-1699), the\r\npolished, formal playwright; Madame de Sévigné (1626-1696), the\r\nbrilliant and witty authoress of memoirs; La Fontaine (1621-1695), the\r\npopular rhymer of whimsical fables and teller of scandalous tales; and\r\nmany another graced the court of Versailles and tasted the royal\r\nbounty. French became the language of fashion as well as of diplomacy--\r\na position it has ever since maintained.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Rule of the Robe\"]\r\n\r\nWhile the court of Louis XIV was thus the focal point of French--almost\r\nof European--life, the professional and mercantile classes, who\r\nconstituted the Third Estate, enjoyed comparative security and\r\nprosperity and under the king held all of the important offices of\r\nactual administration. Because of the judicial offices which the middle\r\nclass filled, the government was popularly styled the \"rule of the\r\nrobe.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Colbert\"]\r\n\r\nColbert (1619-1683), one of Louis's greatest ministers, was the son of\r\na merchant, and was intensely interested in the welfare of the class to\r\nwhich he belonged. Installed in office through the favor of Mazarin, he\r\nwas successively named, after the cardinal's death, superintendent of\r\npublic works, controller-general of finances, minister of marine, of\r\ncommerce and agriculture, and of the colonies. In short, until his\r\ndeath in 1683, he exerted power in every department of government\r\nexcept that of war. Although he never possessed the absolute personal\r\nauthority which marked the ministries of Richelieu and Mazarin, being\r\nplainly subservient to the king's commands, nevertheless he enjoyed for\r\nmany years the royal favor and by incessant toil succeeded in\r\naccomplishing a good deal for the material prosperity of France. In\r\nmany respects his policies and achievements resembled Sully's.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attempted Financial Reform]\r\n\r\nFirst, financial reform claimed all the energies of Colbert. Under the\r\ngovernment of Richelieu, and more particularly under that of Mazarin,\r\nthe hard savings of Sully had been squandered, enormous sums had been\r\ngranted to favorites, and the ever-increasing noble class had been\r\nexempted from taxation, an evil system of tax-gathering, called\r\n\"farming the taxes,\" [Footnote: \"Farming the taxes,\" that is,\r\nintrusting the collection of taxes to individuals or corporations that\r\nsqueezed as much money as they could from the taxpayers and kept for\r\nthemselves what they collected over and above the lump sum due the\r\ngovernment.] had grown up, and the weight of the financial burden had\r\nfallen almost exclusively upon the wretched peasantry. Colbert sternly\r\nand fearlessly set about his task. He appointed agents whose honesty he\r\ncould trust and reformed many of the abuses in tax-collecting. While he\r\nwas unable to impose the direct land tax--the _taille_--upon the\r\nprivileged nobility, he stoutly resisted every attempt further to\r\naugment the number of exemptions, and actually lowered this direct tax\r\nupon the peasantry by substituting indirect taxes, or customs duties,\r\nwhich would in some degree affect all the people. To lighten the burden\r\nof the country-folk, he sought to promote agriculture. He provided that\r\nno farmers' tools might be seized for debt. He encouraged the breeding\r\nof horses and cattle. He improved the roads and other means of interior\r\ncommunication. The great canal of Languedoc, joining the Mediterranean\r\nwith the Garonne River and thence with the Atlantic, was planned and\r\nconstructed under his patronage. As far as possible, the duties on the\r\npassage of agricultural produce from province to province were\r\nequalized.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Colbert and French Merchantilism]\r\n\r\nIn forwarding what he believed to be his own class interests, Colbert\r\nwas especially zealous. Manufactures and commerce were fostered in\r\nevery way he could devise. New industries were established, inventors\r\nprotected, workmen invited from foreign countries, native workmen\r\nprohibited to leave France. A heavy tariff was placed upon foreign\r\nimports in order to protect \"infant industries\" and increase the gain\r\nof French manufacturers and traders. Liberal bounties were allowed to\r\nFrench ships engaged in commerce, and foreign ships were compelled to\r\npay heavy tonnage duties for using French ports. And along with the\r\nprotective tariff and subsidizing of the merchant marine, went other\r\npet policies of mercantilism, [Footnote: See above, pp. 63 f.] such as\r\nmeasures to prevent the exportation of precious metals from France, to\r\nencourage corporations and monopolies, and to extend minute\r\ngovernmental supervision over the manufacture, quality, quantity, and\r\nsale of all commodities. What advantages accrued from Colbert's efforts\r\nin this direction were more than offset by the unfortunate fact that\r\nthe mercantile class was unduly enriched at the expense of other and\r\nnumerically larger classes in the community, and that the centralized\r\nmonarchy, in which the people had no part, proved itself unfit, in the\r\nlong run, to oversee the details of business with wisdom or honesty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Colbert's \"World Policy\"]\r\n\r\nStimulation of industry and commerce has usually necessitated the\r\ncreation of a protecting navy. Colbert appreciated the requirement and\r\nhastened to fulfill it. He reconstructed the docks and arsenal of\r\nToulon and established great ship-yards at Rochefort, Calais, Brest,\r\nand Havre. He fitted out a large royal navy that could compare\r\nfavorably with that of England or Spain or Holland. To supply it with\r\nrecruits he drafted seamen from the maritime provinces and resorted to\r\nthe use of criminals, who were often chained to the galleys like so\r\nmany slaves of the new industry.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the adoption of the mercantile policy seemed to demand the\r\nacquisition of a colonial empire, in which the mother-country should\r\nenjoy a trade monopoly. So Colbert became a vigorous colonial minister.\r\nHe purchased Martinique and Guadeloupe in the West Indies, encouraged\r\nsettlements in San Domingo, in Canada, and in Louisiana, and set up\r\nimportant posts in India, in Senegal, and in Madagascar. France, under\r\nColbert, became a serious colonial competitor with her older European\r\nrivals.\r\n\r\nColbert was essentially a financier and economist. But to the arts of\r\npeace, which adorned the reign of Louis XIV, he was a potent\r\ncontributor. He strengthened the French Academy, which had been founded\r\nby Richelieu, and himself established the Academy of Sciences, now\r\ncalled the Institute of France, and the great astronomical observatory\r\nat Paris. He pensioned many writers, and attracted foreign artists and\r\nscientists to France. Many buildings and triumphal arches were erected\r\nunder his patronage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louvois and French Militarism under Louis XIV]\r\n\r\nIn the arts of war, Louis XIV possessed an equally able and hard-\r\nworking assistant. Louvois (1641-1691) was one of the greatest war\r\nministers that the world has ever seen. He recruited and supported the\r\nlargest and finest standing army of his day. He introduced severe\r\nregulations and discipline. He prescribed, for the first time in\r\nhistory, a distinctive military uniform and introduced the custom of\r\nmarching in step. Under his supervision, camp life was placed upon a\r\nsanitary basis. And under his influence, promotion in the service no\r\nlonger depended primarily on social position but upon merit as well. In\r\nVauban (1633-1707), Louvois had the greatest military engineer in\r\nhistory--for it was Vauban who built those rows of superb\r\nfortifications on the northern and eastern frontiers of France. In\r\nCondé and Turenne, moreover, Louvois had first-class generals who could\r\ngive immediate effect to his reforms and policies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Deceptive Character of the Glamour of the Age of Louis XIV]\r\n\r\nThus was the Grand Monarch well and faithfully served. Yet the outward\r\nshow and glamour of his reign were very deceptive of the true internal\r\nconditions. Colbert tried to do too many things, with the result that\r\nhis plans repeatedly miscarried. The nobles became more indolent,\r\nwasteful, and pleasure-loving, and the middle class more selfish and\r\nmore devoted to their own class interests, while the lot of the\r\npeasantry,--the bulk of the nation,--despite the spasmodic efforts of\r\nthe paternal government, steadily grew worse under the unrelieved\r\nburden of taxation. Then, too, the king was extravagant in maintaining\r\nhis mistresses, his court, and his favorites. His excessive vanity had\r\nto be appeased by expensive entertainment and show. He preferred the\r\nspectacular but woeful feats of arms to the less pretentious but more\r\nsolid triumphs of peace. Indeed, in course of time, Colbert found his\r\ninfluence with the king waning before that of Louvois, and when he died\r\nit was with the bitter thought that his financial retrenchment had been\r\nin vain, that his husbanded resources were being rapidly dissipated in\r\nforeign war. It was Louis's wars that deprived his reign of true\r\ngrandeur and paved the way for future disaster.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, 1685]\r\n\r\nBefore turning our attention to the foreign wars of Louis XIV, mention\r\nmust be made of another blot on his reign. It was Louis XIV who renewed\r\nthe persecution of the Protestants. He was moved alike by the\r\nabsolutist's desire to secure complete uniformity throughout France and\r\nby the penitent's religious fervor to make amends for earlier scandals\r\nof his private life. For a time he contented himself with so-called\r\ndragonnades--quartering licentious soldiers upon the Huguenots--but at\r\nlength in 1685 he formally revoked the Edict of Nantes. France, which\r\nfor almost a century had led Europe in the principle and practice of\r\nreligious toleration, was henceforth reactionary. Huguenots were still\r\ngranted liberty of conscience, but were denied freedom of worship and\r\ndeprived of all civil rights in the kingdom. The immediate effect of\r\nthis arbitrary and mistaken action was the emigration of large numbers\r\nof industrious and valuable citizens, who added materially to the\r\npolitical and economic life of England, Holland, and Prussia, the chief\r\nProtestant foes of France.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTENSION OF FRENCH FRONTIERS\r\n\r\nLouis XIV was not a soldier himself. He never appeared in military\r\nuniform or rode at the head of his troops. What he lacked, however, in\r\npersonal genius as a great military commander, he compensated for in a\r\ngenuine fondness for war and in remarkable personal gifts of diplomacy.\r\nHe was one of the greatest diplomats of his age, and, as we have seen,\r\nhe possessed large loyal armies and able generals that he could employ\r\nin prosecuting the traditional foreign policy of France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Traditional Foreign Policy of France]\r\n\r\nThis foreign policy, which had been pursued by Francis I, Henry II,\r\nHenry IV, Richelieu, and Mazarin, had for its goal the humiliation of\r\nthe powerful Habsburgs, whether of Austria or of Spain. Although France\r\nhad gained materially at their expense in the treaties of Westphalia\r\nand of the Pyrenees, much remained to be done by Louis XIV. When the\r\nGrand Monarch assumed direct control of affairs in 1661, the Spanish\r\nHabsburgs still ruled not only the peninsular kingdom south of France,\r\nbut the Belgian Netherlands to the north, Franche Comte to the east,\r\nand Milan in northern Italy, while their kinsmen of Austria maintained\r\nshadowy imperial government over the rich Rhenish provinces on the\r\nnortheastern boundary of France. France was still almost completely\r\nencircled by Habsburg holdings.\r\n\r\n[Sidebar: Doctrine of \"Natural Boundaries\"]\r\n\r\nTo justify his subsequent aggressions, Louis XIV propounded the\r\ndoctrine of \"natural boundaries.\" Every country, he maintained, should\r\nsecure such frontiers as nature had obviously provided--mountains,\r\nlakes, or rivers; and France was naturally provided with the frontiers\r\nof ancient Gaul--the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Rhine River, and the\r\nOcean. Any foreign monarch or state that claimed power within such\r\nfrontiers was an interloper and should be expelled.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Wars of Louis XIV]\r\n\r\nFor many years, and in three great wars, Louis XIV endeavored, with\r\nsome success, to reach the Rhine. These three wars--the War of\r\nDevolution, the Dutch War, and the War of the League of Augsburg--we\r\nshall now discuss. A fourth great war, directed toward the acquisition\r\nof the Spanish throne by the Bourbon family, will be treated separately\r\non account of the wide and varied interests involved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"War of Devolution\"]\r\n\r\nThe War of Devolution was an attempt of Louis to gain the Spanish or\r\nBelgian Netherlands. It will be remembered that in accordance with the\r\npeace of the Pyrenees, Louis had married Maria Theresa, the eldest\r\ndaughter of Philip IV of Spain. Now by a subsequent marriage Philip IV\r\nhad had a son, a weak-bodied, half-witted prince, who came to the\r\nthrone in 1665 as Charles II. Louis XIV at once took advantage of this\r\nturn of affairs to assert in behalf of his wife a claim to a portion of\r\nthe Spanish inheritance. The claim was based on a curious custom which\r\nhad prevailed in the inheritance of private property in the\r\nNetherlands, to the effect that children of a first marriage should\r\ninherit to the exclusion of those of a subsequent marriage. Louis\r\ninsisted that this custom, called \"devolution,\" should be applied not\r\nonly to private property but also to sovereignty and that his wife\r\nshould be recognized, therefore, as sovereign of the Belgian\r\nNetherlands. In reality the claim was a pure invention, but the French\r\nking thought it would be a sufficient apology for the robbery of a weak\r\nbrother-in-law.\r\n\r\nBefore opening hostilities, Louis XIV made use of his diplomatic wiles\r\nin order to guard himself against assistance which other states might\r\nrender to Spain. In the first place, he obtained promises of friendly\r\nneutrality from Holland, Sweden, and the Protestant states of Germany\r\nwhich had been allied with France during the Thirty Years' War. In the\r\nsecond place, he threatened to stir up another civil war in the Holy\r\nRoman Empire if the Austrian Habsburgs should help their Spanish\r\nkinsman. Finally, he had no fear of England because that country was in\r\nthe midst of a peculiarly bitter trade war with the Dutch. [Footnote:\r\nIt was on the eve of this second trade war between England and Holland\r\n(1665-1667) that the English took New Amsterdam from the Dutch (1664)\r\nand rechristened it New York, and during this struggle that the\r\nremarkable Dutch admiral, De Ruyter, burned the English fleet and\r\nshipping on the Thames (June, 1667).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Balance of Power\"]\r\n\r\nThe War of Devolution lasted from 1667 to 1668. The well-disciplined\r\nand splendidly generaled armies of Louis XIV had no difficulty in\r\noccupying the border fortresses in the Spanish Netherlands. The whole\r\nterritory would undoubtedly have fallen to France, had not a change\r\nunexpectedly occurred in international affairs. The trade war between\r\nEngland and Holland came to a speedy end, and the two former rivals now\r\njoined with Sweden in forming the Triple Alliance to arrest the war and\r\nto put a stop to the French advance. The \"balance of power\" demanded,\r\nsaid the allies, that the other European states should combine in order\r\nto prevent any one state from becoming too powerful. This plea for the\r\n\"balance of power\" was the reply to the French king's plea for \"natural\r\nboundaries.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, 1668]\r\n\r\nThe threats of the Triple Alliance caused Louis XIV to negotiate the\r\ntreaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, by which Spain surrendered to France an\r\nimportant section of territory in Flanders, including the fortified\r\ncities of Charleroi, Tournai, and Lille, but still retained the greater\r\npart of the Belgian Netherlands. The taste of the Grand Monarch was\r\nthereby whetted, but his appetite hardly appeased.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Franco-Dutch Rivalry]\r\n\r\nLouis blamed the Dutch for his rebuff. He was thoroughly alive to the\r\nfact that Holland would never take kindly to having powerful France as\r\na near neighbor, and that French acquisition of the Belgian\r\nNetherlands, therefore, would always be opposed by the Dutch. Nor were\r\nwounded vanity and political considerations the only motives for the\r\nGrand Monarch's second war, that against the Dutch. France, as well as\r\nEngland, was now becoming a commercial and colonial rival of Holland,\r\nand it seemed both to Louis XIV and to Colbert that the French middle\r\nclass would be greatly benefited by breaking the trade monopolies of\r\nthe Dutch. Louis's second war was quite as much a trade war as a\r\npolitical conflict.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Civil Strife in Holland]\r\n\r\nFirst, Louis bent his energies to breaking up the Triple Alliance and\r\nisolating Holland. He took advantage of the political situation in\r\nEngland to arrange (1670) the secret treaty of Dover with Charles II,\r\nthe king of that country: in return for a large pension, which should\r\nfree him from reliance upon Parliament, the English king undertook to\r\ndeclare himself a Roman Catholic and to withdraw from the Triple\r\nAlliance. Liberal pensions likewise bought off the Swedish government.\r\nIt seemed now as if Holland, alone and friendless, would have to endure\r\na war with her powerful enemy. Nor was Holland in shape for a\r\nsuccessful resistance. Ever since she had gained formal recognition of\r\nher independence (1648), she had been torn by civil strife. On one\r\nside, the head of the Orange family, who bore the title of stadholder,\r\nsupported by the country districts, the nobles, the Calvinistic clergy,\r\nand the peasantry, hoped to consolidate the state and to establish an\r\nhereditary monarchy. On the other side, the aristocratic burghers and\r\nreligious liberals, the townsfolk generally, found an able leader in\r\nthe celebrated Grand Pensionary, John DeWitt (1625-1672), who sought to\r\npreserve the republic and the rights of the several provinces. For over\r\ntwenty years, the latter party was in power, but as the young prince of\r\nOrange, William III, grew to maturity, signs were not lacking of a\r\nreaction in favor of his party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Dutch War]\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, Louis XIV declared war against Holland in\r\n1672. French troops at once occupied Lorraine on the pretext that its\r\nduke was plotting with the Dutch, and thence, proceeding down the\r\nRhine, past Cologne, invaded Holland and threatened the prosperous city\r\nof Amsterdam. The Dutch people, in a frenzy of despair, murdered John\r\nDeWitt, whom they unjustly blamed for their reverses; and, at the order\r\nof the young William III, who now assumed supreme command, they cut the\r\ndykes and flooded a large part of northern Holland. The same expedient\r\nwhich had enabled them to expel the Spaniards in the War of\r\nIndependence now stayed the victorious advance of the French.\r\n\r\nThe refusal of Louis XIV to accept the advantageous terms of peace\r\noffered by the Dutch aroused general apprehension throughout Europe.\r\nThe Emperor Leopold and the Great Elector of Brandenburg made an\r\noffensive alliance with Holland, which subsequently was joined by Spain\r\nand several German states. The general struggle, thus precipitated,\r\ncontinued indeed with success for France. Turenne, by a brilliant\r\nvictory, compelled the Great Elector to make peace. The emperor was\r\ndefeated. The war was carried into the Spanish Netherlands and Franche\r\nComté.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treaty of Nijmwegen, 1678]\r\n\r\nBut when at length the English Parliament compelled Charles II to\r\nadhere to the general anti-French alliance, Louis XIV thought it was\r\ntime to make peace. As events proved, it was not Holland but Spain that\r\nhad to pay the penalties of Louis's second war. By the treaty of\r\nNijmwegen, the former lost nothing, while the latter ceded to France\r\nthe long-coveted province of Franche Comté and several strong\r\nfortresses in the Belgian Netherlands. France, moreover, continued to\r\noccupy the duchy of Lorraine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effects of the Dutch War on France]\r\n\r\nThus, if Louis XIV had failed to punish the insolence of the Dutch, he\r\nhad at least succeeded in extending the French frontiers one stage\r\nnearer the Rhine. He had become the greatest and most-feared monarch in\r\nEurope. Yet for these gains France paid heavily. The border provinces\r\nhad been wasted by war. The treasury was empty, and the necessity of\r\nnegotiating loans and increasing taxes put Colbert in despair. Turenne,\r\nthe best general, had been killed late in the contest, and Condé, on\r\naccount of ill health, was obliged to withdraw from active service.\r\n\r\nYet at the darker side of the picture, the Grand Monarch refused to\r\nlook. He was puffed up with pride by his successes in war and\r\ndiplomacy. Like many another vain, ambitious ruler, he felt that what\r\neconomic grievances or social discontent might exist within his country\r\ncould readily be forgotten or obscured in a blaze of foreign glory--in\r\nthe splendor of ambassadors, the glint and din of arms, the grim\r\nshedding of human blood. Having picked the sanguinary path, and at\r\nfirst found pleasure therein, the Grand Monarch pursued it to an end\r\nbitter for his family and tragic for his people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Chambers of Reunion\" and Further French Annexations]\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the Dutch War concluded than Louis XIV set out by a\r\npolicy of trickery and diplomacy further to augment the French\r\nterritories. The cessions, which the treaties of Westphalia and\r\nNijmwegen guaranteed to France, had been made \"with their\r\ndependencies.\" It now occurred to Louis that doubtless in the old\r\nfeudal days of the middle ages or early modern times some, if not all,\r\nof his new acquisitions had possessed feudal suzerainty over other\r\ntowns or territories not yet incorporated into France. Although in most\r\ncases such ancient feudal ties had practically lapsed by the close of\r\nthe seventeenth century, nevertheless the French king decided to\r\nreinvoke them in order, if possible, to add to his holdings. He\r\naccordingly constituted special courts, called \"Chambers of Reunion,\"\r\ncomposed of his own obedient judges, who were to decide what districts\r\nby right of ancient feudal usage should be annexed. So painstaking and\r\nminute were the investigations of these Chambers of Reunion that they\r\nadjudged to their own country, France, no less than twenty important\r\ntowns of the Holy Roman Empire, including Luxemburg and Strassburg.\r\nNothing seemed to prevent the prompt execution of these judgments by\r\nthe French king. He had kept his army on a war footing. The king of\r\nEngland was again in his pay and his alliance. The emperor was hard\r\npressed by an invasion of the Ottoman Turks. Armed imperial resistance\r\nat Strassburg was quickly overcome (1681), and Vauban, the great\r\nengineer, proceeded to make that city the chief French fortress upon\r\nthe Rhine. A weak effort of the Spanish monarch to protect Luxemburg\r\nfrom French aggression was doomed to dismal failure (1684).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War of the League of Augsburg or of the Palatinate]\r\n\r\nAlarmed by the steady advance of French power, the Emperor Leopold in\r\n1686 succeeded in forming the League of Augsburg with Spain, Sweden,\r\nand several German princes, in order to preserve the territorial\r\nintegrity of the Holy Roman Empire. Nor was it long before the League\r\nof Augsburg was called upon to resist further encroachments of the\r\nFrench king. In 1688 Louis dispatched a large army into the Rhenish\r\nPalatinate to enforce a preposterous claim which he had advanced to\r\nthat valuable district. The war which resulted was Louis's third\r\nstruggle, and has been variously styled the War of the League of\r\nAugsburg or the War of the Palatinate. In America, where it was to be\r\nparalleled by an opening conflict between French and English colonists,\r\nit has been known as King William's War.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: William III, Stadholder of Holland and King of England]\r\n\r\nIn his first two wars, Louis XIV could count upon the neutrality, if\r\nnot the friendly aid, of the English. Their king was dependent upon him\r\nfor financial support in maintaining an absolutist government. Their\r\ninfluential commercial and trading classes, who still suffered more\r\nfrom Dutch than from French rivalry, displayed no anxiety to mix unduly\r\nin the dynastic conflicts on the Continent. Louis had an idea that he\r\ncould count upon the continuation of the same English policy; he was\r\ncertainly on good terms with the English king, James II (1685-1688).\r\nBut the deciding factor in England and in the war was destined to be\r\nnot the subservient James II but the implacable William III. This\r\nWilliam III, [Footnote: William III (1650-1702), Dutch stadholder in\r\n1672 and British king in 1689.] as stadholder of Holland, had long been\r\na stubborn opponent of Louis XIV on the Continent; he had repeatedly\r\ndisplayed his ability as a warrior and as a cool, crafty schemer.\r\nThrough his marriage with the princess Mary, elder daughter of James\r\nII, he now managed adroitly to ingratiate himself with the Protestant,\r\nparliamentary, and commercial parties in England that were opposing the\r\nCatholic, absolutist, and tyrannical policies of James.\r\n\r\nWe shall presently see that the English Revolution of 1688, which drove\r\nJames II into exile, was a decisive step in the establishment of\r\nconstitutional government in England. It was likewise of supreme\r\nimportance in its effects upon the foreign policy of Louis XIV, for it\r\ncalled to the English throne the son-in-law of James, William III, the\r\nstadholder of Holland and arch enemy of the French king.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beginning of a new Hundred Years' War between France and\r\nEngland]\r\n\r\nEngland, under the guidance of her new sovereign, promptly joined the\r\nLeague of Augsburg, and declared war against France. Trade rivalries\r\nbetween Holland and England were in large part composed, and the\r\ncolonial empires of the two states, now united under a joint ruler,\r\nnaturally came into conflict with the colonial empire of France. Thus,\r\nin addition to the difficulties which the Bourbons encountered in\r\npromoting their dynastic interests on the continent of Europe, they\r\nwere henceforth confronted by a vast colonial and commercial struggle\r\nwith England. It was the beginning of a Hundred Years' War that was to\r\nbe fought for the mastery of India and America.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV never seemed to appreciate the importance of the colonial\r\nside of the contest. He was too much engrossed in his ambition of\r\nstretching French boundaries to the Rhine. So in discussing the War of\r\nthe League of Augsburg as well as the subsequent War of the Spanish\r\nSuccession, we shall devote our attention in this chapter primarily to\r\nthe European and dynastic elements, reserving the account of the\r\nparallel colonial struggle to a later chapter on the \"World Conflict of\r\nFrance and Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\nThe War of the League of Augsburg, Louis' third war, lasted from 1689\r\nto 1697. Notwithstanding the loss of Turenne and Condé, the splendidly\r\norganized French armies were able to hold the allies at bay and to save\r\ntheir country from invasion. They even won several victories on the\r\nfrontier. But on the sea, the struggle was less successful for Louis,\r\nand a French expedition to Ireland in favor of James II proved\r\ndisastrous. After many years of strife, ruinous to all the combatants,\r\nthe Grand Monarch sued for peace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Treaty of Ryswick, 1697]\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of Ryswick, which concluded the War of the League of\r\nAugsburg, Louis XIV (1) surrendered nearly all the places adjudged to\r\nhim by the Chambers of Reunion, except Strassburg; (2) allowed the\r\nDutch to garrison the chief fortresses in the Spanish Netherlands as a\r\n\"barrier\" against French aggression; (3) granted the Dutch a favorable\r\ncommercial treaty; (4) restored Lorraine to its duke; (5) abandoned his\r\nclaim to the Palatinate; (6) acknowledged William III as king of\r\nEngland and promised to support no attempt against his throne. Thus,\r\nthe French king lost no territory,--in fact, he obtained full\r\nrecognition of his ownership of the whole province of Alsace,--but his\r\nreputation and vanity had been uncomfortably wounded.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WAR OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION\r\n\r\nOne of the main reasons that prompted Louis XIV to sue for peace and to\r\nabandon his claims on Lorraine and the Palatinate was the rapid\r\nphysical decline of the inglorious Spanish monarch, Charles II, of\r\nwhose enormous possessions the French king hoped by diplomacy and\r\nintrigue to secure valuable portions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Spanish Inheritance]\r\n\r\nSpain was still a great power. Under its crown were gathered not only\r\nthe ancient kingdoms of Castile, Aragon, and Navarre in the Spanish\r\npeninsula, but the greater part of the Belgian Netherlands, and in\r\nItaly the kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the duchy of Milan, and the\r\ncontrol of Tuscany, as well as the huge colonial empire in America and\r\nthe Philippines. At the time when kings were absolute rulers and\r\nreckoned their territories as personal possessions, much depended upon\r\nthe royal succession.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Spanish Succession]\r\n\r\nNow it happened that the Spanish Habsburgs were dying out in the male\r\nline. Charles II was himself without children or brothers. Of his\r\nsisters, the elder was the wife of Louis XIV and the younger was\r\nmarried to the Emperor Leopold, the heir of the Austrian Habsburgs.\r\nLouis XIV had renounced by the peace of the Pyrenees (1659) all claims\r\nto the Spanish throne on condition that a large dowry be paid him, but\r\nthe impoverished state of the Spanish exchequer had prevented the\r\npayment of the dowry. Louis, therefore, might lay claim to the whole\r\ninheritance of Charles II and entertain the hope of seeing the Bourbons\r\nsupplant the Habsburgs in some of the fairest lands of Christendom. In\r\nopposition to the French contention, the emperor was properly moved by\r\nfamily pride to put forth the claim of his wife and that of himself as\r\nthe nearest male relative of the Spanish king. If the contention of\r\nLeopold were sustained, a single Habsburg ruler might once more unite\r\nan empire as vast as that which the Emperor Charles V had once ruled.\r\nOn the other side, if the ambition of Louis XIV were realized, a new\r\nand formidable Bourbon empire would be erected. In either case the\r\nEuropean \"balance of power\" would be destroyed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commercial and Colonial Complications]\r\n\r\nBound up with the political problem in Europe were grave commercial and\r\ncolonial questions. According to the mercantilist theories that\r\nflourished throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, every\r\ncountry which possessed colonies should reserve trade privileges with\r\nthem exclusively to its own citizens. So long as France and Spain were\r\nseparate and each was only moderately powerful, their commercial\r\nrivals, notably England and Holland, might hope to gain special trade-\r\nconcessions from time to time in French or Spanish colonies. But once\r\nthe colonial empires of France and Spain were united under a joint\r\nruler, such a vast monopoly would be created as would effectually\r\nprevent the expansion of English or Dutch commerce while it heightened\r\nthe economic prosperity of the Bourbon subjects.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attempts to Partition the Spanish Inheritance]\r\n\r\nIt was natural, therefore, that William III, as stadholder of Holland\r\nand king of England, should hold the balance of power between the\r\nAustrian Habsburgs and the French Bourbons. Both the claimants\r\nappreciated this fact and understood that neither would be allowed\r\npeacefully to appropriate the entire Spanish inheritance. In fact,\r\nseveral \"partition treaties\" were patched up between Louis and William\r\nIII, with a view to maintaining the balance of power and preventing\r\neither France or Austria from unduly increasing its power. But flaws\r\nwere repeatedly found in the treaties, and, as time went on, the\r\nproblem grew more vexatious. After the conclusion of the peace of\r\nRyswick, Louis XIV was absorbed in the game of dividing the property of\r\nthe dying Spanish king. One of the very greatest triumphs of Louis'\r\ndiplomatic art was the way in which he ingratiated himself in Spanish\r\nfavor. It must be remembered that it was Spain which the Grand Monarch\r\nhad attacked and despoiled in his earlier wars of aggrandizement, and\r\nneither the Spanish court nor the Spanish people could have many\r\npatriotic motives for loving him. Yet such was his tact and his finesse\r\nthat within three years after the treaty of Ryswick he had secured the\r\nrespect of the feeble Charles II and the gratitude of the Spanish\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Will of Charles II of Spain in Favor of the French Bourbons]\r\n\r\nA month before his pitiful death (1700), Charles II, the last of the\r\nSpanish Habsburgs, summoned all his strength and dictated a will that\r\nawarded his whole inheritance to Philip of Anjou, the grandson of Louis\r\nXIV, with the resolute proviso that under no circumstances should the\r\nSpanish possessions be dismembered. When the news reached Versailles,\r\nthe Grand Monarch hesitated. He knew that acceptance meant war at least\r\nwith Austria, probably with England. Perhaps he thought of the wretched\r\ncondition into which his other wars had plunged his people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Acceptance of the Will by Louis XIV]\r\n\r\nHesitation was but an interlude. Ambition triumphed over fear, and the\r\nglory of the royal family over the welfare of France. In the great hall\r\nof mirrors at Versailles, the Grand Monarch heralded his grandson as\r\nPhilip V, the first Bourbon king of Spain. And when Philip, left for\r\nMadrid, his now aged grandfather kissed him, and the Spanish ambassador\r\nexultantly declared that \"the Pyrenees no longer exist.\"\r\n\r\nAnticipating the inevitable outbreak of hostilities, Louis proceeded to\r\nviolate the treaty of Ryswick by seizing the \"barrier\" fortresses from\r\nthe Dutch and by recognizing the son of James II as king of England. He\r\nthen made hasty alliances with Bavaria and Savoy, and called out the\r\ncombined armies of France and Spain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Grand Alliance against the Bourbons]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, William III and the Emperor Leopold formed the Grand\r\nAlliance, to which at first England, Holland, Austria, and the German\r\nelectors of Brandenburg-Prussia, Hanover, and the Palatinate adhered.\r\nSubsequently, Portugal, by means of a favorable commercial treaty with\r\nEngland,[Footnote: The \"Methuen Treaty\" (1703).] was induced to join\r\nthe alliance, and the duke of Savoy abandoned France in favor of\r\nAustria with the understanding that his country should be recognized as\r\na kingdom. The allies demanded that the Spanish crown should pass to\r\nthe Archduke Charles, the grandson of the emperor, that Spanish trade\r\nmonopolies should be broken, and that the power of the French king\r\nshould be curtailed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The War of the Spanish Succession]\r\n\r\nThe War of the Spanish Succession--the fourth and final war of Louis\r\nXIV--lasted from 1702 to 1713. Although William III died at its very\r\ncommencement, he was certain that it would be vigorously pushed by the\r\nEnglish government of his sister-in-law, Queen Anne (1702-1714). The\r\nbitter struggle on the high seas and in the colonies, where it was\r\nknown as Queen Anne's War, will be treated in another place. [Footnote:\r\nSee below, p. 308.] The military campaigns in Europe were on a larger\r\nscale than had hitherto been known. Fighting was carried on in the\r\nNetherlands, in the southern Germanies, in Italy, and in Spain.\r\n\r\nThe tide of war turned steadily for several years against the Bourbons.\r\nThe allies possessed the ablest generals of the time in the duke of\r\nMarlborough (1650-1722), the conscientious self-possessed English\r\ncommander, and in the skillful and daring Prince Eugene of Savoy (1663-\r\n1736). The great battle of Blenheim (1704) drove the French from the\r\nHoly Roman Empire, and the capture of Gibraltar (1704) gave England a\r\nfoothold in Spain and a naval base for the Mediterranean. Prince Eugene\r\ncrowded the French out of Italy (1706); and by the victories of\r\nRamillies (1706), Oudenarde (1708), and Malplaquet (1709), Marlborough\r\ncleared the Netherlands. On land and sea one reverse followed another.\r\nThe allies at length were advancing on French soil. It appeared\r\ninevitable that they would settle peace at Paris on their own terms.\r\n\r\nThen it was that Louis XIV displayed an energy and devotion worthy of a\r\nbetter cause. He appealed straight to the patriotism of his people. He\r\nset an example of untiring application to toil. Nor was he disappointed\r\nin his expectations. New recruits hurried to the front; rich and poor\r\npoured in their contributions; a supreme effort was made to stay the\r\nadvancing enemy.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Louis XIV was not worse punished was due to this\r\nremarkable uprising of the French and Spanish nations and likewise to\r\ndissensions among the allies. A change of ministry in England led to\r\nthe disgrace and retirement of the duke of Marlborough and made that\r\ncountry lukewarm in prosecuting the war. Then, too, the unexpected\r\naccession of the Archduke Charles to the imperial and Austrian thrones\r\n(1711) now rendered the claims of the allies' candidate for the Spanish\r\nthrone as menacing to the European balance of power as would be the\r\nrecognition of the French claimant, Philip of Bourbon.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances made possible the conclusion of the peace of\r\nUtrecht, with the following major provisions:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Peace of Utrecht 1713-1714]\r\n\r\n(1) Philip V, grandson of Louis XIV, was acknowledged king of Spain and\r\nthe Indies, on condition that the crowns of France and Spain should\r\nnever be united. (2) The Austrian Habsburgs were indemnified by\r\nsecuring Naples, Sardinia, [Footnote: By the treaty of London (1720),\r\nAustria exchanged Sardinia for Sicily.] Milan, and the Belgian\r\nNetherlands. The last-named, which had been called the Spanish\r\nNetherlands since the days of Philip II, were henceforth for a century\r\nstyled the Austrian Netherlands.\r\n\r\n(3) England received the lion's share of the spoils. She obtained\r\nNewfoundland, Acadia (Nova Scotia), and Hudson Bay from France, and\r\nGibraltar and Minorca from Spain. She also secured a preferential\r\ntariff for her imports into the great port of Cadiz, the monopoly of\r\nthe slave trade, and the right of sending one ship of merchandise a\r\nyear to the Spanish colonies. France promised not to assist the Stuarts\r\nin their attempts to regain the English throne.\r\n\r\n(4) The Dutch recovered the \"barrier\" fortresses and for garrisoning\r\nthem were promised financial aid by Austria. The Dutch were also\r\nallowed to establish a trade monopoly on the River Scheldt.\r\n\r\n(5) The elector of Brandenburg was acknowledged king of Prussia, an\r\nimportant step In the fortunes of the Hohenzollern family which at the\r\npresent time reigns in Germany.\r\n\r\n(6) The duchy of Savoy was recognized similarly as a kingdom and was\r\ngiven the island of Sicily. [Footnote: The title of king was recognized\r\nby the emperor only in 1720, when Savoy exchanged Sicily for Sardinia.\r\nHenceforth the kingdom of Savoy was usually referred to as the kingdom\r\nof Sardinia.] From the house of Savoy has descended the reigning\r\nsovereign of present-day Italy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Significance of the Settlement of Utrecht]\r\n\r\nThe peace of Utrecht marked the cessation of a long conflict between\r\nSpanish Habsburgs and French Bourbons. For nearly a century thereafter\r\nboth France and Spain pursued similar foreign policies for the common\r\ninterests of the Bourbon family. Bourbon sovereigns have continued,\r\nwith few interruptions, to reign in Spain to the present moment.\r\n\r\nThe Habsburg influence, however, remained paramount in Austria, in the\r\nHoly Roman Empire, in Italy, and in the Belgian Netherlands. It was\r\nagainst this predominance that the Bourbons were to direct their\r\ndynastic policies throughout the greater part of the eighteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe peace of Utrecht likewise marked the rise of English power upon the\r\nseas and the gradual elimination of France as a successful competitor\r\nin the race for colonial mastery. Two states also came into prominence\r\nupon the continent of Europe--Prussia and Savoy--about which the new\r\nGerman Empire and the unified Italian Kingdom were respectively to be\r\nbuilded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Last Years of the Grand Monarch]\r\n\r\nWhile France was shorn of none of her European conquests, nevertheless\r\nthe War of the Spanish Succession was exceedingly disastrous for that\r\ncountry. In its wake came famine and pestilence, excessive imposts and\r\ntaxes, official debasement of the currency, and bankruptcy--a long line\r\nof social and economic disorders. Louis XIV survived the treaty of\r\nUtrecht but two years, and to such depths had his prestige and glory\r\nfallen among his own people, that his corpse, as it passed along the\r\nroyal road to the stately tombs of the French kings at St. Denis, \"was\r\nsaluted by the curses of a noisy crowd sitting in the wine-rooms,\r\ncelebrating his death by drinking more than their fill as a\r\ncompensation for having suffered too much from hunger during his\r\nlifetime. Such was the coarse but true epitaph which popular opinion\r\naccorded to the Grand Monarch.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Misgovernment of France during Minority of Louis XV]\r\n\r\nNor had the immediate future much better things in store for exhausted\r\nFrance. The successor upon the absolutist throne was Louis XV, great-\r\ngrandson of Louis XIV and a boy of five years of age, who did not\r\nundertake to exercise personal power until near the middle of the\r\neighteenth century. In the meantime the country was governed for about\r\neight years by the king's uncle, the duke of Orleans, and then for\r\ntwenty years by Cardinal Fleury.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Law]\r\n\r\nOrleans loved pleasure and gave himself to a life of debauchery; he\r\ncared little for the boy-king, whose education and training he\r\ngrievously neglected. His foreign policy was weak and vacillating, and\r\nhis several efforts to reform abuses in the political and economic\r\ninstitutions of Louis XIV invariably ended in failure. It was while\r\nexperimenting with the disorganized finances that he was duped by a\r\nScotch adventurer and promoter, a certain John Law (1671-1729). Law had\r\nan idea that a gigantic corporation might be formed for French colonial\r\ntrade, [Footnote: Law's corporation was actually important in the\r\ndevelopment of Louisiana.] shares might be widely sold throughout the\r\ncountry, and the proceeds therefrom utilized to wipe out the public\r\ndebt. Orleans accepted the scheme and for a while the country went mad\r\nwith the fever of speculation. In due time, however, the stock was\r\ndiscovered to be worthless, the bubble burst, and a terrible panic\r\nensued. The net result was increased misery for the nation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fleury and the War of the Polish Election]\r\n\r\nThe little sense which Orleans possessed was sufficient to keep him out\r\nof foreign war [Footnote: France was at peace throughout his regency,\r\nexcept for a brief time (1719-1720) when Orleans joined the British\r\ngovernment in preventing his Spanish cousin, Philip V, from upsetting\r\nthe treaty of Utrecht.] but even that was lacking to his successor,\r\nCardinal Fleury. Fleury was dragged into a war (1733-1738) with Austria\r\nand Russia over the election of a Polish king. The allies supported the\r\nelector of Saxony; France supported a Pole, the father-in-law of Louis\r\nXV, Stanislaus Leszczinski. France was defeated and Louis XV had to\r\ncontent himself with securing the duchy of Lorraine for his father-in-\r\nlaw. Thus, family ambition merely added to the economic distress of the\r\nFrench people.\r\n\r\nIt was during the War of the Polish Election, however, that the Bourbon\r\nking of Spain, perceiving his rivals engaged elsewhere, seized the\r\nkingdom of the Two Sicilies from Austria and put a member of his own\r\nfamily on its throne. Thus, in the eighteenth century, the Bourbons\r\ndominated France, Spain, and southern Italy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SPANISH SUCCESSION]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BOURBON FAMILY, 1589-1915 KINGS OF FRANCE, SPAIN,\r\nAND NAPLES]\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL READING\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL.

We now\r\nturn to a nation which played but a minor rôle in the international\r\nrivalries of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Later, from 1689\r\nto 1763, England was to engage in a tremendous colonial struggle with\r\nFrance. But from 1560 to 1689 England for the most part held herself\r\naloof from the continental rivalries of Bourbons and Habsburgs, and\r\nnever fought in earnest except against Philip II of Spain, who\r\nthreatened England's economic and political independence, and against\r\nthe Dutch, who were England's commercial rivals. While the continental\r\nstates were engaged in dynastic quarrels, England was absorbed in a\r\nconflict between rival principles of domestic government--between\r\nconstitutional parliamentary government and unlimited royal power. To\r\nthe triumph of the parliamentary principle in England we owe many of\r\nour modern ideas and practices of constitutional government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Absolutism of the Tudors, 1485-1603]\r\n\r\nAbsolutism had reached its high-water mark in England long before the\r\npower and prestige of the French monarchy had culminated in the person\r\nof Louis XIV. In the sixteenth century--the very century in which the\r\nFrench sovereigns faced constant foreign war and chronic civil\r\ncommotion--the Tudor rulers of England were gradually freeing\r\nthemselves from reliance upon Parliament and were commanding the united\r\nsupport of the English nation. From the accession of Henry VII in 1485\r\nto the death of his grand-daughter Elizabeth in 1603, the practice of\r\nabsolutism, though not the theory of divine-right monarchy, seemed ever\r\nto be gaining ground.\r\n\r\nHow Tudor despotism was established and maintained is explained in part\r\nby reference to the personality of Henry VII and to the circumstances\r\nthat brought him to the throne. [Footnote: For the character and main\r\nachievements of Henry VII (1485-1500), see above, pp. 4 ff.] It is also\r\nexplicable by reference to historical developments in England\r\nthroughout the sixteenth century. [Footnote: For the reigns of Henry\r\nVIII, Edward VI, Mary, and Elizabeth, see above, pp. 86, 97 ff., 150\r\nff.] As Henry VII humbled the nobility, so Henry VIII and Elizabeth\r\nsubordinated the Church to the crown. And all the Tudors asserted their\r\nsupremacy in the sphere of industry and commerce. By a law of 1503, the\r\ncraft gilds had been obliged to obtain the approval of royal officers\r\nfor whatever new ordinances the gilds might wish to make. In the first\r\nyear of the reign of Edward VI the gilds were crippled by the loss of\r\npart of their property, which was confiscated under the pretext of\r\nreligious reform. Elizabeth's reign was notable for laws regulating\r\napprenticeship, prescribing the terms of employment of laborers,\r\nproviding that wages should be fixed by justices of the peace, and\r\nordering vagabonds to be set to work. In the case of commerce, the\r\nroyal power was exerted encouragingly, as when Henry VII negotiated the\r\n_Intercursus Magnus_ with the duke of Burgundy to gain admittance\r\nfor English goods into the Netherlands, or chartered the \"Merchant\r\nAdventurers\" to carry on trade in English woolen cloth, or sent John\r\nCabot to seek an Atlantic route to Asia; or as when Elizabeth\r\ncountenanced and abetted explorers and privateers and smugglers and\r\nslave-traders in extending her country's maritime power at the expense\r\nof Spain. All this meant that the strong hand of the English monarch\r\nhad been laid upon commerce and industry as well as upon justice,\r\nfinance, and religion.\r\n\r\nThe power of the Tudors had rested largely upon their popularity with\r\nthe growing influential middle class. They had subdued sedition, had\r\nrepelled the Armada, had fostered prosperity, and had been willing at\r\ntimes to cater to the whims of their subjects. They had faithfully\r\npersonified national patriotism; and the English nation, in turn, had\r\nextolled them.\r\n\r\nYet despite this absolutist tradition of more than a century's\r\nduration, England was destined in the seventeenth century to witness a\r\nlong bitter struggle between royal and parliamentary factions, the\r\nbeheading of one king and the exiling of another, and in the end the\r\nirrevocable rejection of the theory and practice of absolutist divine-\r\nright monarchy, and this at the very time when Louis XIV was holding\r\nmajestic court at Versailles and all the lesser princes on the\r\nContinent were zealously patterning their proud words and boastful\r\ndeeds after the model of the Grand Monarch. In that day a mere\r\nparliament was to become dominant in England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Accession of the Stuarts: James I, 1603-1625]\r\n\r\nThe death of Elizabeth, the last of the Tudors, and the accession\r\n(1603) of her cousin James, the first of the Stuarts, marked the real\r\nbeginning of the struggle. When he was but a year old, this James had\r\nacquired through the deposition of his unfortunate mother, Mary Stuart,\r\nthe crown of Scotland (1567), and had been proclaimed James VI in that\r\ndisorderly and distracted country. The boy who was whipped by his tutor\r\nand kidnapped by his barons and browbeaten by Presbyterian divines\r\nlearned to rule Scotland with a rod of iron and incidentally acquired\r\nsuch astonishing erudition, especially in theology, that the clever\r\nKing Henry IV of France called him \"the wisest fool in Christendom.\" At\r\nthe age of thirty-seven, this Scotchman succeeded to the throne of\r\nEngland as James I. \"He was indeed,\" says Macaulay, \"made up of two\r\nmen--a witty, well-read scholar who wrote, disputed, and harangued, and\r\na nervous, driveling idiot who acted.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Stuart Theory of Absolutist Divine-right Monarchy]\r\n\r\nJames was not content, like his Tudor predecessors, merely to be an\r\nabsolute ruler in practice; he insisted also upon the theory of divine-\r\nright monarchy. Such a theory was carefully worked out by the pedantic\r\nStuart king eighty years before Bishop Bossuet wrote his classic\r\ntreatise on divine-right monarchy for the guidance of the young son of\r\nLouis XIV. To James it seemed quite clear that God had divinely\r\nordained kings to rule, for had not Saul been anointed by Jehovah's\r\nprophet, had not Peter and Paul urged Christians to obey their masters,\r\nand had not Christ Himself said, \"Render unto Cæsar that which is\r\nCæsar's\"? As the father corrects his children, so should the king\r\ncorrect his subjects. As the head directs the hands and feet, so must\r\nthe king control the members of the body politic. Royal power was thus\r\nthe most natural and the most effective instrument for suppressing\r\nanarchy and rebellion. James I summarized his idea of government in the\r\nfamous Latin epigram, \"_a deo rex, a rege lex_, \"--\"the king is\r\nfrom God, and law from the king.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stuart Theory Opposed to Medieval English Tradition]\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked already [Footnote: See above, pp. 4-7] that in one\r\nimportant respect the past governmental evolution of England differed\r\nfrom that of France. While both countries in the sixteenth century\r\nfollowed absolutist tendencies, in France the medieval tradition of\r\nconstitutional limitations upon the power of the king was far weaker\r\nthan in England, with the result that in the seventeenth century the\r\nFrench accepted and consecrated absolutism while the English gave new\r\nforce and life to their medieval tradition and practice of\r\nconstitutional government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Restrictions on Royal Power in England: Magna Carta]\r\n\r\nThe tradition of English restrictions upon royal power centered in the\r\nold document of _Magna Carta_ and in an ancient institution called\r\nParliament. _Magna Carta_ dated back, almost four centuries before\r\nKing James, to the year 1215 when King John had been compelled by his\r\nrebellious barons to sign a long list of promises; that list was the\r\n\"long charter\" or _Magna Carta_, [Footnote: _Magna Carta_ was\r\nmany times reissued after 1215.] and it was important in three\r\nrespects. (1) It served as a constant reminder that \"the people\" of\r\nEngland had once risen in arms to defend their \"rights\" against a\r\ndespotic king, although as a matter of fact _Magna Carta_ was more\r\nconcerned with the rights of the feudal nobles (the barons) and of the\r\nclergy than with the rights of the common people. (2) Its most\r\nimportant provisions, by which the king could not levy extraordinary\r\ntaxes on the nobles without the consent of the Great Council, furnished\r\nsomething of a basis for the idea of self-taxation. (3) Clauses such as\r\n\"To no man will we sell, or deny, or delay, right or justice,\" although\r\nnever effectively enforced, established the idea that justice should\r\nnot be sold, denied, or delayed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parliament]\r\n\r\nParliament was a more or less representative assembly of clergy,\r\nnobility, and commoners, claiming to have powers of taxation and\r\nlegislation. The beginnings of Parliament are traced back centuries\r\nbefore James I. There had been an advisory body of prelates and lords\r\neven before the Norman conquest (1066). After the conquest a somewhat\r\nsimilar assembly of the king's chief feudal vassals--lay and\r\necclesiastical--had been called the Great Council, and its right to\r\nresist unjust taxation had been recognized by _Magna Carta_.\r\nHenceforth it had steadily acquired power. The \"Provisions of Oxford\"\r\n(1258) had provided, in addition, for \"twelve honest men\" to represent\r\nthe \"commonalty\" and to \"treat of the wants of the king; and the\r\ncommonalty shall hold as established that which these men shall do.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: House of Lords and House of Commons]\r\n\r\nFor the beginnings of the House of Commons we may go back to the\r\nthirteenth century. In 1254 the king summoned to Parliament not only\r\nthe bishops, abbots, earls, and barons, but also two knights from every\r\nshire. Then, in an irregular Parliament, convened in 1265 by Simon de\r\nMontfort, a great baronial leader against the king, two burgesses from\r\neach of twenty-one towns for the first time sat with the others and\r\nhelped to decide how their liberties were to be protected. These\r\nknights and burgesses were the elements from which the House of Commons\r\nwas subsequently to be formed. Similar bodies met repeatedly in the\r\nnext thirty years, and in 1295 Edward I called a \"model Parliament\" of\r\narchbishops, bishops, abbots, representative clergy, earls, and barons,\r\ntwo knights from every shire, and two citizens from each privileged\r\ncity or borough,--more than four hundred in all. For some time after\r\n1295 the clergy, nobility, and commoners [Footnote: _I.e._, the\r\nknights of the shires and the burgesses from the towns.] may have\r\ndeliberated separately much as did the three \"estates\" in France. At\r\nany rate, early in the fourteenth century the lesser clergy dropped\r\nout, the greater prelates and nobles were fused into one body--the\r\nHouse of \"Lords spiritual and temporal,\"--and the knights joined the\r\nburgesses to form the House of Commons. Parliament was henceforth a\r\nbicameral body, consisting of a House of Commons and a House of Lords.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Powers of Parliament: Taxation]\r\n\r\nThe primary function of Parliament was to give information to the king\r\nand to hear and grant his requests for new \"subsidies\" or direct taxes.\r\nThe right to refuse grants was gradually assumed and legally\r\nrecognized. As taxes on the middle class soon exceeded those on the\r\nclergy and nobility, it became customary in the fifteenth century for\r\nmoney bills to be introduced in the Commons, approved by the Lords, and\r\nsigned by the king.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Legislation]\r\n\r\nThe right to make laws had always been a royal prerogative, in theory\r\nat least. Parliament, however, soon utilized its financial control in\r\norder to obtain initiative in legislation. A threat of withholding\r\nsubsidies had been an effective way of forcing Henry III to confirm\r\n_Magna Carta_ in 1225; it proved no less effective in securing\r\nroyal enactment of later \"petitions\" for laws. In the fifteenth century\r\nlegislation by \"petition\" was supplanted by legislation by \"bill,\" that\r\nis, introducing in either House of Parliament measures which, in form\r\nand language, were complete statutes and which became such by the\r\nunited assent of Commons, Lords, and king. To this day English laws\r\nhave continued to be made formally \"by the King's most Excellent\r\nMajesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and\r\nTemporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the\r\nauthority of the same.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence on Administration]\r\n\r\nThe right to demand an account of expenditures, to cause the removal of\r\nroyal officers, to request the king to abandon unpopular policies, or\r\notherwise to control administrative affairs, had occasionally been\r\nasserted by Parliament, but not consistently maintained.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parliament under the Tudors]\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, it will now be clear that the fulcrum of\r\nparliamentary power was control of finance. What had enabled the Tudors\r\nto incline toward absolutism was the fact that for more than a hundred\r\nyears they had made themselves fairly independent of Parliament in\r\nmatters of finance; and this they had done by means of economy, by\r\ncareful collection of taxes, by irregular expedients, by confiscation\r\nof religious property, and by tampering with the currency. Parliament\r\nstill met, however, but irregularly, and during Elizabeth's reign it\r\nwas in session on the average only three or four weeks of the year.\r\nParliament still transacted business, but rarely differed with the\r\nmonarch on matters of importance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: James I and Parliament]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the Tudor period, then, we have an ancient tradition of\r\nconstitutional, parliamentary government on the one hand, and a strong,\r\npractical, royal power on the other. The conflict between Parliament\r\nand king, which had been avoided by the tactful Tudors, soon began in\r\nearnest when James I ascended the throne in 1603, with his exaggerated\r\nnotion of his own authority. James I was an extravagant monarch, and\r\nneeded parliamentary subsidies, yet his own pedantic principles\r\nprevented him from humoring Parliament in any dream of power. The\r\ninevitable result was a conflict for political supremacy between\r\nParliament and king. When Parliament refused him money, James resorted\r\nto the imposition of customs duties, grants of monopolies, sale of\r\npeerages, and the solicitation of \"benevolences\" (forced loans).\r\nParliament promptly protested against such practices, as well as\r\nagainst his foreign and religious policies and against his absolute\r\ncontrol of the appointment and operation of the judiciary. Parliament's\r\nprotests only increased the wrath of the king. The noisiest\r\nparliamentarians were imprisoned or sent home with royal scoldings. In\r\n1621 the Commoners entered in their journal a \"Great Protestation\"\r\nagainst the king's interference with their free right to discuss the\r\naffairs of the realm. This so angered the king that he tore the\r\nProtestation out of the journal and presently dissolved the intractable\r\nParliament; but the quarrel continued, and James's last Parliament had\r\nthe audacity to impeach his lord treasurer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political Dispute Complicated by Religious Difference]\r\n[Sidenote: Calvinists in England]\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Puritans\"]\r\n\r\nThe political dispute was made more bitter by the co-existence of a\r\nreligious conflict. James, educated as a devout Anglican, was naturally\r\ninclined to continue to uphold the compromise by which the Tudors had\r\nsevered the English Church from the Roman Catholic hierarchy, yet had\r\nretained many forms of the Catholic Church and the episcopal\r\norganization by means of which the sovereign was able to control the\r\nChurch. During Elizabeth's reign, however, a large part of the middle\r\nclass--the townsmen especially--and many of the lower clergy had come\r\nunder the influence of Calvinistic teaching. [Footnote: On the\r\ndoctrines of Calvinism, see above, pp. 139 ff., 156, 164 ff.] The\r\nmovement was marked (1) by a virulent hatred for even the most trivial\r\nforms reminiscent of \"popery,\" as the Roman Catholic religion was\r\ncalled; and (2) by a tendency to place emphasis upon the spirit of the\r\nOld Testament as well as upon the precepts of the New. Along with\r\nausterity of manner, speech, dress, and fast-day observance, they\r\nrevived much of the mercilessness with which the Israelites had\r\nconquered Canaan. The same men who held it a deadly sin to dance round\r\na may-pole or to hang out holly on Christmas were later to experience a\r\nfierce and exalted pleasure in conquering New England from the heathen\r\nIndians. They knew neither self-indulgence nor compassion. Little\r\nwonder that Elizabeth feared men of such mold and used the episcopal\r\nadministration of the Anglican Church to restrain them. Many of these\r\nso-called Puritans remained members of the Anglican Church and sought\r\nto reform it from within. But restraint only caused the more radical to\r\ncondemn altogether the fabric of bishops and archbishops, and to\r\nadvocate a presbyterian church. Others went still further and wished to\r\nseparate from the Established Anglican Church into independent\r\nreligious groups, and were therefore called Independents or\r\nSeparatists.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hostility of James I to the Puritans]\r\n\r\nThese religious radicals, often grouped together as \"Puritans,\" were\r\ncontinually working against Elizabeth's strict enforcement of Anglican\r\northodoxy. The accession of James was seized by them as an occasion for\r\nthe presentation of a great petition for a modification of church\r\ngovernment and ritual. The petition bore no fruit, however, and in a\r\nreligious debate at Hampton Court in 1604 James made a brusque\r\ndeclaration that bishops like kings were set over the multitude by the\r\nhand of God, and, as for these Puritans who would do away with bishops,\r\nhe would make them conform or \"harry them out of the land.\" From this\r\ntime forth he insisted on conformity, and deprived many clergymen of\r\ntheir offices for refusing to subscribe to the regulations framed in\r\n1604.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hatred of the Puritans for James I]\r\n\r\nThe hard rule of this monarch who claimed to govern by the will of God\r\nwas rendered even more abhorrent to the stern Puritan moralists by\r\nreports of \"drunken orgies\" and horrible vices which made the royal\r\ncourt appear to be a veritable den of Satan. But worst of all was his\r\nsuspected leaning towards \"popery.\" The Puritans had a passionate\r\nhatred for anything that even remotely suggested Roman\r\nCatholicism. Consequently it was not with extreme pleasure that they\r\nwelcomed a king whose mother had been a Catholic, whose wife was\r\nsuspected of harboring a priest, a ruler who at times openly exerted\r\nhimself to obtain greater toleration for Roman Catholics and to\r\nmaintain the Anglican ritual against Puritan modification. With growing\r\nalarm and resentment they learned that Catholic conspirators had\r\nplotted to blow up the houses of Parliament, and that in his foreign\r\npolicy James was decidedly friendly to Catholic princes.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal points of James's foreign policy,--union with Scotland,\r\npeace, and a Spanish alliance,--were all calculated to arouse\r\nantagonism. The English, having for centuries nourished enmity for\r\ntheir northern neighbors and perceiving no apparent advantage in close\r\nunion, defeated the project of amalgamating the two kingdoms of England\r\nand Scotland. James's policy of non-intervention in the Thirty Years'\r\nWar evoked bitter criticism; he was accused of favoring the Catholics\r\nand of deserting his son-in-law, the Protestant elector of the\r\nPalatinate. The most hotly contested point was, however, the Spanish\r\npolicy. Time and time again, Parliament protested, but James pursued\r\nhis plans, making peace with Spain, and negotiating for a marriage\r\nbetween his son Charles and the Infanta of Spain, and Prince Charles\r\nactually went to Spain to court the daughter of Philip III.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Interconnection of Puritanism, Commercialism, and\r\nParliamentarianism]\r\n\r\nIt was essentially the Puritan middle classes who were antagonized by\r\nthe king. The strength of the Puritans rested in the middle class of\r\nmerchants, seamen, and squires. It was this class which had profited by\r\nthe war with Spain in the days of \"good Queen Bess\" when many a Spanish\r\nprize, laden with silver and dye woods, had been towed into Plymouth\r\nharbor. Their dreams of erecting an English colonial and commercial\r\nempire on the ruins of Spain's were rudely shattered by James. It was\r\nto this Puritan middle class that papist and Spaniard were bywords for\r\nassassin and enemy. By his Spanish policy, as well as by his irregular\r\nmethods of taxation, James had touched the Puritans in their\r\npocketbooks. The Puritans, too, were grieved to see so sinful a man sit\r\non the throne of England, and so wasteful a man squander their money.\r\nThey were even hindered in the exercise of their religious convictions.\r\nEvery fiber in them rebelled.\r\n\r\nPuritans throughout the country looked to the large Puritan majority in\r\nthe House of Commons to redress their grievances. The parliamentary\r\nstruggle became then not only a defense of abstract ideals of democracy\r\nbut also a bitter battle in defense of class interests. Parliamentary\r\ntraditions were weapons against an oppressive monarch; religious\r\nscruples gave divine sanction to an attack on royalist bishops;\r\nconsciousness of being God's elect gave confidence in assailing the\r\naristocracy of land and birth. For the present, the class interests of\r\nthe Puritans were to be defended best by the constitutional limitation\r\nof royal power, and in their struggle with James's son and successor,\r\nCharles I (1625-1649), they represent by chance the forces of\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles I, 1625-1649]\r\n[Sidenote: A True Stuart in Devotion to Absolutism]\r\n\r\nFor a time it appeared as if the second Stuart king would be very\r\npopular. Unlike his father, Charles seemed thoroughly English; and his\r\nathletic frame, his dignified manners, and his purity of life\r\ncontrasted most favorably with James's deformities in character and\r\nphysique. Two years before his father's death Charles had been jilted\r\nby his Spanish fiancée and had returned to England amid wild rejoicing\r\nto aid Parliament in demanding war with Spain. He had again rejoiced\r\nthe bulk of the English nation by solemnly assuring Parliament on the\r\noccasion of his marriage contract with Henrietta Maria, sister of Louis\r\nXIII of France, that he would grant no concessions to Roman Catholics\r\nin England. As a matter of fact, Charles simultaneously but secretly\r\nassured the French government not only that he would allow the queen\r\nthe free exercise of her religion but that he would make general\r\nconcessions to Roman Catholics in England. This duplicity on the part\r\nof the young king, which augured ill for the harmony of future\r\nrelations between himself and Parliament, throws a flood of light upon\r\nhis character and policies. Though Charles was sincerely religious and\r\nwell-intentioned, he was as devoted to the theory of divine-right\r\nmonarchy as his father had been; and as to the means which he might\r\nemploy in order to establish absolutism upon a firm foundation he\r\nhonestly believed himself responsible only to God and to his own\r\nconscience, certainly not to Parliament. This fact, together with a\r\ncertain inherent aptitude for shirking the settlement of difficulties,\r\nexplains in large part the faults which historians have usually\r\nascribed to him--his meanness and ingratitude toward his most devoted\r\nfollowers, his chronic obstinacy which only feigned compliance, and his\r\nincurable untruthfulness.\r\n\r\nJust before Charles came to the throne, Parliament granted subsidies in\r\nexpectation of a war against Spain, but, when he had used up the war-\r\nmoney without showing any serious inclination to open hostilities with\r\nSpain, and had then demanded additional grants, Parliament gave\r\nevidence of its growing distrust by limiting a levy of customs duties\r\nto one year, instead of granting them as usual for the whole reign. In\r\nview of the increasingly obstinate temper manifested by the House of\r\nCommons in withholding subsidies and in assailing his worthless\r\nfavorite, the Duke of Buckingham, Charles angrily dissolved his first\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Continued Conflict between King and Parliament]\r\n[Sidenote: The Petition of Right, 1628]\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of the administration were augmented not only by this\r\narbitrary treatment of Parliament but also by the miserable failure of\r\nan English fleet sent against Cadiz, and by the humiliating result of\r\nan attempt to relieve the French Huguenots. Meanwhile, a second\r\nParliament, more intractable even than its predecessor, had been\r\ndissolved for its insistence on the impeachment of Buckingham. Attempts\r\nto raise money by forced loans in place of taxes failed to remove the\r\nfinancial distress into which Charles had fallen, and consequently, in\r\n1628, he consented to summon a third Parliament. In return for grants\r\nof subsidies, he signed the _Petition of Right_ (1628), prepared\r\nby the two houses. By it he promised not to levy taxes without consent\r\nof Parliament, not to quarter soldiers in private houses, not to\r\nestablish martial law in time of peace, not to order arbitrary\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nEven these concessions were not enough. Parliament again demanded the\r\nremoval of Buckingham, and only the assassination of the unpopular\r\nminister obviated prolonged dispute on that matter. The Commoners next\r\nattempted to check the unauthorized collection of customs duties, which\r\nproduced as much as one-fourth of the total royal revenue, and to\r\nprevent the introduction of \"popish\" innovations in religion, but for\r\nthis trouble they were sent home.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Personal\" Rule of Charles I, 1629-1640]\r\n\r\nCharles was now so thoroughly disgusted with the members of Parliament\r\nthat he determined to rule without them, and for eleven years (1629-\r\n1640) he successfully carried on a \"personal\" as distinct from a\r\nparliamentary government, in spite of financial and religious\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nWithout the consent of Parliament, Charles was bound not to levy direct\r\ntaxes. During the period of his personal rule, therefore, he was\r\ncompelled to adopt all sorts of expedients to replenish his treasury.\r\nHe revived old feudal laws and collected fines for their infraction. A\r\nsum of one hundred thousand pounds was gained by fines on suburban\r\nhouseholders who had disobeyed a proclamation of James I forbidding the\r\nextension of London. The courts levied enormous fines merely for the\r\nsake of revenue. Monopolies of wine, salt, soap, and other articles\r\nwere sold to companies for large sums of money; but the high prices\r\ncharged by the companies caused much popular discontent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Personal\" Rule of Charles I, 1629-1640]\r\n[Sidenote: \"Ship money\"]\r\n\r\nThe most obnoxious of all devices for raising money were the levies of\r\n\"ship-money.\" Claiming that it had always been the duty of seaboard\r\ntowns to equip ships for the defense of the country, Charles demanded\r\nthat since they no longer built ships, the towns should contribute\r\nmoney for the maintenance of the navy. In 1634, therefore, each town\r\nwas ordered to pay a specified amount of \"ship-money\" into the royal\r\ntreasury, and the next year the tax was extended to inland towns and\r\ncounties. [Footnote: The first writ of ship-money yielded £100,000\r\n(Cunningham).] To test the legality of this exaction, a certain John\r\nHampden refused to pay his twenty shillings ship-money, and took the\r\nmatter to court, claiming that ship-money was illegal taxation. The\r\nmajority of the judges, who held office during the king's pleasure and\r\nwere therefore strictly under royal influence, upheld the legality of\r\nship-money and even went so far as to assert that in times of emergency\r\nthe king's prerogative was unlimited, but the country rang with\r\nprotests and Hampden was hailed as a hero.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Devotion of Charles I to the Anglican Church: Archbishop\r\nLaud]\r\n[Sidenote: Puritan Opposition]\r\n\r\nOpposition to financial exactions went hand in hand with bitter\r\nreligious disputes. Charles had intrusted the control of religious\r\naffairs to William Laud, whom he named archbishop of Canterbury, and\r\nshowed favor to other clergymen of marked Catholic leanings. The laws\r\nagainst Roman Catholics were relaxed, and the restrictions on Puritans\r\nincreased. It seemed as if Charles and his bishops were bent upon\r\ngoading the Puritans to fury, at the very time when one by one the\r\npractices, the vestments, and even the dogmas of the Catholic Church\r\nwere being reintroduced into the Anglican Church, when the tyrannical\r\nKing James was declared to have been divinely inspired, and when\r\nPuritan divines were forced to read from their pulpits a royal\r\ndeclaration permitting the \"sinful\" practices of dancing on the green\r\nor shooting at the butts (targets) on the Sabbath. [Footnote: It is an\r\ninteresting if not a significant fact that the Puritans with their\r\naustere views about observance of the Sabbath not only decreased the\r\nnumber of holidays for workingmen, but interfered with innocent\r\nrecreation on the remaining day of rest. One aspect of the resulting\r\nmonotonous life of the laborer was, according to Cunningham, the\r\nremarkable increase of drunkenness at this period.] So hard was the lot\r\nof the extreme Protestants in England that thousands fled the country\r\nand established themselves in America. [Footnote: In the decade 1630-\r\n1640 some 20,000 Englishmen sailed for the colonies. Many of these,\r\nhowever, emigrated by reason of strictly economic distress.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Scotch Covenant, and Beginnings of Armed Opposition to\r\nthe King]\r\n[Sidenote: Convocation of the Long Parliament, 1640]\r\n\r\nIn his Scotch policy Charles overreached himself. With the zealous\r\ncoöperation of Archbishop Laud, imprudently attempted to strengthen the\r\nepiscopacy (system of bishops) in the northern kingdom, and likewise to\r\nintroduce an un-Calvinistic order of public worship. Thereupon the\r\nangry Scotch Presbyterians signed a great Covenant, swearing to defend\r\ntheir religion (1638); they deposed the bishops set over them by the\r\nking and rose in revolt. Failing in a first effort to crush the Scotch\r\nrebellion, the king summoned a Parliament in order to secure financial\r\nsupport for an adequate royal army. This Parliament--the so-called\r\nShort Parliament--was dissolved, however, after some three weeks of\r\nbootless wrangling. Now unable to check the advance of the rebellious\r\nScotch forces into northern England, Charles in desperation convoked\r\n(1640) a new Parliament, which, by reason of its extended duration\r\n(1640-1660), has been commonly called the Long Parliament. In England\r\nand Scotland divine-right monarchy had failed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PURITAN REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reforms of the Long Parliament]\r\n\r\nConfident that Charles could neither fight nor buy off the Scotch\r\nwithout parliamentary subsidies, the Long Parliament showed a decidedly\r\nstubborn spirit. Its leader, John Pym, a country gentleman already\r\nfamous for speeches against despotism, openly maintained that in the\r\nHouse of Commons resided supreme authority to disregard ill-advised\r\nacts of the Upper House or of the king. Hardly less radical were the\r\nviews of John Hampden and of Oliver Cromwell, the future dictator of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe right of the Commons to impeach ministers of state, asserted under\r\nJames I, was now used to send to the Tower both Archbishop Laud and\r\nThomas Wentworth, earl of Strafford, who, since 1629, had been the\r\nking's most valued and enthusiastically loyal minister. [Footnote:\r\nStrafford was accused of treason, but was executed in 1641 in\r\naccordance with a special \"bill of attainder\" enacted by Parliament.\r\nLaud was put to death in 1645.] The special tribunals--the Court of\r\nHigh Commission, the Court of Star Chamber, and others--which had\r\nserved to convict important ecclesiastical and political offenders were\r\nabolished. No more irregular financial expedients, such as the\r\nimposition of ship-money, were to be adopted, except by the consent of\r\nParliament. As if this were not enough to put the king under the thumb\r\nof his Parliament, the royal prerogative of dissolving that body was\r\nabrogated, and meetings at least every three years were provided for by\r\na \"Triennial Act.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Violation of Parliamentary Privileges: Attempted Seizure by\r\nCharles of the Five Members]\r\n[Sidenote: The Great Rebellion, 1642-1646]\r\n\r\nAll the contested points of government had been decided adversely to\r\nthe king. But his position was now somewhat stronger. He had been able\r\nto raise money, the Scotch invaders had turned back, and the House of\r\nCommons had shown itself to be badly divided on the question of church\r\nreform and in its debates on the publication of a \"Grand Remonstrance\"\r\n--a document exposing the grievances of the nation and apologizing for\r\nthe acts of Parliament. Moreover, a rebellion had broken out in Ireland\r\nand Charles expected to be put at the head of an army for its\r\nsuppression. With this much in his favor, the king in person entered\r\nthe House of Commons and attempted to arrest five of its leaders, but\r\nhis dismal failure only further antagonized the Commons, who now\r\nproceeded to pass ordinances without the royal seal, and to issue a\r\ncall to arms. The levy of troops contrary to the king's will was an act\r\nof rebellion; Charles, therefore, raised the royal standard at\r\nNottingham and called his loyal subjects to suppress the Great\r\nRebellion (1642-1646).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Parties to the Civil War: \"Cavaliers\" and \"Roundheads\"]\r\n\r\nTo the king's standard rallied the bulk of the nobles, high churchmen,\r\nand Roman Catholics, the country \"squires,\" and all those who disliked\r\nthe austere moral code of the Puritans. In opposition to him a few\r\ngreat earls led the middle classes--small land-holders, merchants,\r\nmanufacturers, shop-keepers, especially in London and other busy towns\r\nthroughout the south and east of England. The close-cropped heads of\r\nthese \"God-fearing\" tradesmen won them the nickname \"Roundheads,\" while\r\nthe royalist upper classes, not thinking it a sinful vanity to wear\r\ntheir hair in long curls, were called \"Cavaliers.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parliament and the Presbyterians]\r\n\r\nIn the Long Parliament there was a predominance of the Presbyterians--\r\nthat class of Puritans midway between the reforming Episcopalians and\r\nthe radical Independents. Accordingly a \"solemn league and covenant\"\r\nwas formed (1643) with the Scotch Presbyterians for the establishment\r\nof religious uniformity on a Presbyterian basis in England and Ireland\r\nas well as in Scotland. After the defeat of Charles at Marston Moor\r\n(1644) the Presbyterians abolished the office of bishop, removed altars\r\nand communion rails from the churches, and smashed crucifixes, images,\r\nand stained-glass windows. Presbyterianism became a more intolerant\r\nstate religion than Anglicanism had been. Satisfied with their work,\r\nthe Presbyterian majority in Parliament were now willing to restore the\r\nking, provided he would give permanence to their religious settlement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Army and the Independents: Oliver Cromwell]\r\n\r\nThe Independent army, however, was growing restive. Oliver Cromwell, an\r\nIndependent, had organized a cavalry regiment of \"honest sober\r\nChristians\" who were fined 12 pence if they swore, who charged in\r\nbattle while \"singing psalms,\" and who went about the business of\r\nkilling their enemies in a pious and prayerful, but withal a highly\r\neffective, manner. Indeed, so successful were Cromwell's \"Ironsides\"\r\nthat a considerable part of the Parliamentary army was reorganized on\r\nhis plan. The \"New Model\" army, as it was termed, was Independent in\r\nsympathy, that is to say, it wished to carry on the war, and to\r\noverthrow the tyranny of the Presbyterians as well as that of the\r\nAnglicans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cromwell's Army Defeats the King and Dominates Parliament]\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Rump Parliament\"]\r\n\r\nThe \"New Model\" army, under the command of Fairfax and Cromwell,\r\ndefeated Charles and forced him to surrender in 1646. For almost two\r\nyears the Presbyterian Parliament negotiated for the restoration of the\r\nking and at last would have made peace with the royalists, had not the\r\narmy, which still remembered Charles's schemes to bring Irish and\r\nforeign \"papists\" to fight Englishmen, now taken a hand in affairs.\r\nColonel Pride, stationed with his soldiers at the door of the House of\r\nCommons, arrested the 143 Presbyterian Commoners, and left the\r\nIndependents--some sixty strong--to deliberate alone upon the nation's\r\nweal (1648). This \"Rump\" or sitting part of Parliament, acting on its\r\nown authority, appointed a \"High Court of justice\" by whose sentence\r\nCharles I was beheaded, 30 January, 1649. It then decreed England to be\r\na Commonwealth with neither king nor House of Lords.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Commonwealth, 1649-1660]\r\n\r\nThe executive functions, hitherto exercised by the king, were intrusted\r\nto a Council of State, of whose forty-one members thirty were members\r\nof the House. The Rump Parliament, instead of calling for new\r\nelections, as had been expected, continued to sit as the\r\n\"representatives of the people,\" although they represented the\r\nsentiments of only a small fraction of the people. England was in the\r\nhands of an oligarchy whose sole support was the vigorous army of\r\nCromwell.\r\n\r\nMenacing conditions confronted the newly born Commonwealth. War with\r\nScotland and with Holland was imminent; mutiny and unrest showed that\r\nthe execution of Charles had infused new life into the royalists;\r\nCatholic-royalist rebels mastered all of Ireland except Dublin. Under\r\nthese circumstances, the Commonwealth would have perished but for three\r\nsources of strength: (1) Its financial resources proved adequate:\r\ncustoms duties were collected, excise taxes on drinks and food were\r\nlevied, and confiscated royalist estates were sold; (2) its enemies had\r\nno well-drilled armies; and (3) its own army was remarkably powerful.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cromwell and the Restoration of Order]\r\n\r\nCromwell, victor in a series of bloody engagements in Ireland, after\r\nbutchering thousands of the defeated royalists and shipping others as\r\nslaves to Barbados, was able to return to London in 1650, declaring, \"I\r\nam persuaded that this is a righteous judgment of God upon these\r\nbarbarous wretches [the Irish] who have imbrued their hands in so much\r\ninnocent blood, and that it will tend to prevent the effusion of blood\r\nfor the future.\" The next movement of Cromwell, as Parliamentary\r\ncommander-in-chief, was against the Scotch, who had declared for\r\nCharles II, the son of Charles I. The Scotch armies were annihilated,\r\nand Prince Charles fled in disguise to France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Navigation Act, 1651]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the members of the Rump, still the nominal rulers of England,\r\nfinding opportunity for profit in the sale of royalist lands and in the\r\nadministration of finance, had exasperated Cromwell by their\r\nmaladministration and neglect of the public welfare. The life of the\r\nRump was temporarily prolonged, however, by the popularity of its\r\nlegislation against the Dutch, at this time the rivals of England on\r\nthe seas and in the colonies. In 1651 the Rump passed the first\r\nNavigation Act, forbidding the importation of goods from Asia, Africa,\r\nor America, except in English or colonial ships, and providing that\r\ncommodities of European production should be imported only in vessels\r\nof England or of the producing country. The framers of the Navigation\r\nAct intended thereby to exclude Dutch vessels from trading between\r\nEngland and other lands. The next year a commercial and naval war\r\n(1652-1654) broke out between England and Holland, leading to no\r\ndecisive result, but, on the whole, increasing the prestige of the\r\nEnglish navy. With renewed confidence the Rump contemplated\r\nperpetuating its narrow oligarchy, but Cromwell's patience was\r\nexhausted, and in 1653 he turned Parliament out of doors, declaring,\r\n\"Your hour is come, the Lord hath done with you!\" Cromwell remained as\r\nmilitary and religious dictator.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oliver Cromwell]\r\n\r\nOliver Cromwell (1599-1658) is the most interesting figure in\r\nseventeenth-century England. Belonging by birth to the class of country\r\ngentlemen, his first appearance in public life was in the Parliament of\r\n1628 as a pleader for the liberty of Puritan preaching. When the Long\r\nParliament met in 1640, Cromwell, now forty-one years of age, assumed a\r\nconspicuous place. His clothes were cheap and homely, \"his countenance\r\nswollen and reddish, his voice sharp and untuneable,\" nevertheless his\r\nfervid eloquence and energy soon made him \"very much hearkened unto.\"\r\nFrom the Civil War, as we know, Cromwell emerged as an unequaled\r\nmilitary leader, the idol of his soldiers, fearing God but not man. His\r\nfrequent use of Biblical phrases in ordinary conversation and his\r\nmanifest confidence that he was performing God's work flowed from an\r\nintense religious zeal. He belonged, properly speaking, to the\r\nIndependents, who believed that each local congregation of Christians\r\nshould be practically free, excepting that \"prelacy\" (_i.e._, the\r\nepiscopal form of church government) and \"popery\" (_i.e._, Roman\r\nCatholic Christianity) were not to be tolerated. In private life\r\nCromwell was fond of \"honest sport,\" of music and art. It is said that\r\nhis gayety when he had \"drunken a cup of wine too much\" and his taste\r\nin statuary shocked his more austere fellow-Puritans. In public life he\r\nwas a man of great forcefulness, occasionally giving way to violent\r\ntemper; he was a statesman of signal ability, aiming to secure good\r\ngovernment and economic prosperity for England and religious freedom\r\nfor Protestant Dissenters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Radical Experiments under Cromwell]\r\n\r\nAfter arbitrarily dissolving the Rump of the Long Parliament (1653),\r\nCromwell and his Council of State broke with tradition entirely by\r\nselecting 140 men to constitute a legislative body or convention. This\r\nbody speedily received the popular appellation of \"Barebone's\r\nParliament\" after one of its members, a certain leather merchant, who\r\nbore the descriptive Puritan name of Praisegod Barebone. The new\r\nlegislators were good Independents--\"faithful, fearing God, and hating\r\ncovetousness.\" Recommended by Independent ministers, they felt that God\r\nhad called them to rule in righteousness. Their zeal for reform found\r\nexpression in the reduction of public expenditure, in the equalization\r\nof taxes, and in the compilation of a single code of laws; but their\r\nradical proposals for civil marriage and for the abolition of tithes\r\nstartled the clergy and elicited from the larger landowners the cry of\r\n\"confiscation!\" Before much was accomplished, however, the more\r\nconservative members of \"Barebone's Parliament\" voted to \"deliver up\r\nunto the Lord-General [Cromwell] the powers we received from him.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Protectorate, 1653-1659]\r\n\r\nUpon the failure of this experiment, Cromwell's supporters in the army\r\nprepared an \"Instrument of Government,\" or constitution. By this\r\nInstrument of Government--the first written constitution in modern\r\ntimes--a \"Protectorate\" was established, which was a constitutional\r\nmonarchy in all but name. Oliver Cromwell, who became \"Lord Protector\"\r\nfor life, was to govern with the aid of a small Council of State.\r\nParliaments, meeting at least every three years, were to make laws and\r\nlevy taxes, the Protector possessing the right to delay, but not to\r\nveto, legislation. Puritanism was made the state religion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parliament under the Protectorate]\r\n\r\nThe first Parliament under the Protectorate was important for three\r\nreasons. (1) It consisted of only one House; (2) it was the Parliament\r\nof Great Britain and Ireland rather than of England alone; (3) its\r\nmembers were elected on a reformed basis of representation,--that is,\r\nthe right of representation had been taken from many small places and\r\ntransferred to more important towns.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Practical Dictatorship of Cromwell, 1655-1658]\r\n\r\nAlthough royalists were excluded from the polls, the Independents were\r\nunable to control a majority in the general election, for, it must be\r\nremembered, they formed a very small, though a powerful, minority of\r\nthe population. The Presbyterians in the new Parliament, with\r\ncharacteristic stubbornness, quarreled with Cromwell, until he abruptly\r\ndismissed them (1655). Thenceforth Cromwell governed as a military\r\ndictator, placing England under the rule of his generals, and\r\nquarreling with his Parliaments. To raise money he obliged all those\r\nwho had borne arms for the king to pay him 10 per cent of their rental.\r\nWhile permitting his office to be made hereditary, he refused to accept\r\nthe title of king, but no Stuart monarch had ruled with such absolute\r\npower, nor was there much to choose between James's \"_a deo rex, a\r\nrege lex_\" and Cromwell's, \"If my calling be from God and my\r\ntestimony from the people, God and the people shall take it from me,\r\nelse I will not part from it.\"\r\n\r\nThe question is often raised, how Cromwell, representing the\r\nnumerically insignificant Independents, contrived to maintain himself\r\nas absolute ruler of the British Isles. Three circumstances may have\r\ncontributed to his strength. (1) He was the beloved leader of an army\r\nrespected for its rigid discipline and feared for its grim\r\nmercilessness. (2) Under his strict enforcement of law and order, trade\r\nand industry brought domestic prosperity. (3) His conduct of foreign\r\naffairs was both satisfactory to English patriotism and profitable to\r\nEnglish purses. Advantageous commercial treaties were made with the\r\nDutch and the French. Industrious Jews were allowed to enter England.\r\nBarbary pirates were chastised. In a war against Spain, the army won\r\nDunkirk; and the navy, now becoming truly powerful, sank a Spanish\r\nfleet, wrested Jamaica from Spain, and brought home ship-loads of\r\nSpanish silver.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of Cromwell's position, however, was obvious. Cavaliers\r\nwere openly hostile to a régime of religious zealots; moderate\r\nAnglicans would suffer the despotism of Cromwell only as long as it\r\npromoted prosperity; Presbyterians were anxious to end the toleration\r\nwhich was accorded to all Puritan sects; radicals and republicans were\r\neager to try new experiments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disorganization following the Death of Oliver Cromwell]\r\n\r\nThe death of Cromwell (1658) left the army without a master and the\r\ncountry without a government. True, Oliver's son, Richard Cromwell\r\n(1626-1712), attempted for a time to fill his father's place, but soon\r\nabdicated after having lost control of both army and Parliament. Army\r\nofficers restored the Rump of the Long Parliament, dissolved it, set it\r\nup again, and forced it to recall the Presbyterian members who had been\r\nexpelled in 1648, and ended by obliging the reconstituted Long\r\nParliament to convoke a new and freely elected \"Convention Parliament.\"\r\nMeanwhile, General Monck opened negotiations for the return of Charles\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RESTORATION: THE REIGN OF CHARLES II\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Popular Grievances against the Protectorate]\r\n\r\nThe widespread and exuberant enthusiasm which restored the Stuarts was\r\nnot entirely without causes, social and religious, as well as\r\npolitical. The grievances and ideals which had inspired the Great\r\nRebellion were being forgotten, and a new generation was finding fault\r\nwith the Protectorate. The simple country folk longed for their may-\r\npoles, their dances, and games on the green; only fear compelled them\r\nto bear with the tyranny of the sanctimonious soldiers who broke the\r\nwindows in their churches. Especially hard was the lot of tenants and\r\nlaborers on the many estates purchased or seized by Puritans during the\r\nRebellion. Many townsmen, too, excluded from the ruling oligarchy,\r\nfound the Puritan government as oppressive and arbitrary as that of\r\nCharles I.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opposition to Puritanism]\r\n\r\nThe religious situation was especially favorable for Charles II. The\r\noutrages committed by Cromwell's soldiery had caused the Independents\r\nto be looked upon as terrible fanatics, Even the Presbyterians were\r\nwilling to yield some points to the king, if only Independency could be\r\noverthrown; and many who had been inclined to Puritanism were now\r\nunwavering in loyalty to the Anglican Church. Orthodox Anglicanism,\r\nfrom its origin, had been bound up with the monarchy, and it now\r\nconsistently expected a double triumph of the \"divine-right\" of kings\r\nand of bishops. Most bitter of all against the Cromwellian régime were\r\nthe Roman Catholics in Ireland. Though Cromwell as Lord Protector had\r\nfavored toleration for Protestants, it would be long before Catholics\r\ncould forget the Irish priests whom Cromwell's soldiery had brutally\r\nknocked on the head, or the thousands of Catholic girls and boys whom\r\nCromwell's agents had sold into horrible slavery in the West Indies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Royalist Reaction]\r\n\r\nThis strong royalist undercurrent, flowing from religious and social\r\nconditions, makes more comprehensible the ease with which England\r\ndrifted back into the Stuart monarchy. The younger generation, with no\r\nmemory of Stuart despotism, and with a keen dislike for the confusion\r\nin which no constitutional form was proof against military tyranny,\r\ngave ready credence to Prince Charles's promises of constitutional\r\ngovernment. There seemed to be little probability that the young\r\nmonarch would attempt that arbitrary rule which had brought his\r\nfather's head to the block.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles II, 1660-1685]\r\n\r\nThe experiment in Puritan republicanism had resulted only in convincing\r\nthe majority of the people that \"the government is, and ought to be, by\r\nKing, Lords, and Commons.\" The people merely asked for some assurances\r\nagainst despotism,--and when a throne was thus to be purchased with\r\npromises, Charles II was a ready buyer. He swore to observe _Magna\r\nCarta_ and the \"Petition of Right,\" to respect Parliament, not to\r\ninterfere with its religious policy, nor to levy illegal taxes. Bound\r\nby these promises, he was welcomed back to England in 1660 and crowned\r\nthe following year. The reinstatement of the king was accompanied by a\r\ngeneral resumption by bishops and royalist nobles of their offices and\r\nlands: things seemed to slip back into the old grooves. Charles II\r\ndated his reign not from his actual accession but from his father's\r\ndeath, and his first Parliament declared invalid all those acts and\r\nordinances passed since 1642 which it did not specifically confirm.\r\n\r\nThe history of constitutional government under the restored Stuarts is\r\na history of renewed financial and religious disputes. Charles II and\r\nhis younger brother and heir, Prince James, duke of York, alike adhered\r\nto the political faith of their Stuart father and grandfather. Cousins\r\non their mother's side of Louis XIV of France, in whose court they had\r\nbeen reared, they were more used to the practices of French absolutism\r\nthan to the peculiar customs of parliamentary government in England.\r\nUnlike their father, who had been most upright in private life and most\r\nloyal to the Anglican Church, both Charles and James had acquired from\r\ntheir foreign environment at once a taste for vicious living and a\r\nstrong attachment to the Roman Catholic Church. In these two Stuarts\r\nCatholicism was combined with absolutism; and the Englishmen\r\nrepresented in Parliament were therefore brought face to face not only\r\nwith a revival of the earlier Stuart theory of divine-right monarchy\r\nbut with a new and far more hateful possibility of the royal\r\nestablishment of Roman Catholicism in England. Charles II did not\r\npublicly confess his conversion to Catholicism until his deathbed, but\r\nJames became a zealous convert in 1672.\r\n\r\nThat Charles II was able to round out a reign of twenty-five years and\r\ndie a natural death as king of England was due not so much to his\r\nvirtues as to his faults. He was so hypocritical that his real aims\r\nwere usually successfully concealed. He was so indolent that with some\r\nshow of right he could blame his ministers and advisers for his own\r\nmistakes and misdeeds. He was so selfish that he would make concessions\r\nhere and there rather than \"embark again upon his travels.\" In fact,\r\npure selfishness was the basis of his policy in domestic and foreign\r\naffairs, but it was always a selfishness veiled in wit, good humor, and\r\ncaptivating affability.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Renewal of Financial Disputes between King and Parliament]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the reign of Charles II, the country gentlemen were\r\nastute enough to secure the abolition of the surviving feudal rights by\r\nwhich the king might demand certain specified services from them and\r\ncertain sums of money when an heiress married or a minor inherited an\r\nestate. This action, seemingly insignificant, was in reality of the\r\ngreatest importance, for it indicated the abandonment in England of the\r\nfeudal theory that land is held by nobles in return for military\r\nservice, and at the same time it consecrated the newer principle that\r\nthe land should be owned freely and personally--a principle which has\r\nsince been fully recognized in the United States and other modern\r\ncountries as well as in England. The extinction of feudal prerogatives\r\nin the early days of the Stuart Restoration benefited the landlords\r\nprimarily, but the annual lump sum of £100,000 which Charles II was\r\ngiven in return, was voted by Parliament and was paid by all classes in\r\nthe form of excise taxes on alcoholic drinks. Customs duties of £4\r\n10_s_. on every tun of wine and 5 per cent _ad valorem_ on\r\nother imports, hearth-money (a tax on houses), and profits on the post\r\noffice contributed to make up the royal revenue of somewhat less than\r\n£1,200,000. This was intended to defray the ordinary expenses of court\r\nand government but seemed insufficient to Charles, who was not only\r\nextravagantly luxurious, but desirous of increasing his power by\r\nbribing members of Parliament and by maintaining a standing army. The\r\ncountry squires who had sold their plate for the royalist cause back in\r\nthe 'forties and were now suffering from hard times, thought the court\r\nwas too extravagant; to this feeling was added fear that Charles might\r\nhire foreign soldiers to oppress Englishmen. Consequently Parliament\r\ngrew more parsimonious, and in 1665-1667 claimed a new and important\r\nprivilege--that of devoting its grants to specific objects and\r\ndemanding an account of expenditures.\r\n\r\nCharles, however, was determined to have money by fair means or foul. A\r\ngroup of London goldsmiths had loaned more than a million and a quarter\r\npounds sterling to the government. In 1672 Charles announced that\r\ninstead of paying the money back, he would consider it a permanent\r\nloan. Two years earlier he had signed the secret treaty of Dover (1670)\r\nwith Louis XIV, by which Louis promised him an annual subsidy of\r\n£200,000 and troops in case of rebellion, while Charles was openly to\r\njoin the Roman Catholic Church and to aid Louis in his French wars\r\nagainst Spain and Holland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Continued Religious Complications]\r\n[Sidenote: Legislation against Protestant Dissenters]\r\n\r\nIn his ambition to reëstablish Catholicism in England, Charles\r\nunderestimated the intense hostility of the bulk of the English squires\r\nto any religious innovation. During the first decade of the\r\nRestoration, Puritanism had been most feared. Some two thousand\r\nclergymen, mostly Presbyterian, had been deprived of their offices by\r\nan Act of Uniformity (1662), requiring their assent to the Anglican\r\nprayer-book; these dissenting clergymen might not return within five\r\nmiles of their old churches unless they renounced the \"Solemn League\r\nand Covenant\" and swore loyalty to the king (Five-mile Act, 1665); for\r\nrepeated attendance at their meetings (conventicles) Dissenters might\r\nbe condemned to penal servitude in the West Indies against (Conventicle\r\nAct, 1664); and the Corporation Act of 1661 excluded Dissenters from\r\ntown offices.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Leanings of Charles II toward Roman Catholicism]\r\n\r\nAs the danger from Puritanism disappeared, the Catholic cloud darkened\r\nthe horizon. In 1672 Prince James, the heir to the throne, embraced\r\nCatholicism; and in the same year Charles II issued a \"Declaration of\r\nIndulgence,\" suspending the laws which oppressed Roman Catholics and\r\nincidentally the Dissenters likewise. The Declaration threw England\r\ninto paroxysms of fear; it was believed that the Catholic monarch of\r\nFrance was about to aid in the subversion of the Anglican Church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Leanings of Charles II toward Roman Catholicism]\r\n[Sidenote: The Exclusion Bill]\r\n\r\nParliament, already somewhat distrustful of Charles's foreign policy,\r\nand fearful of his leanings toward Roman Catholicism, found in the\r\nDeclaration of Indulgence a serious infraction of parliamentary\r\nauthority. The royal right to \"suspend\" laws upon occasion had\r\nundoubtedly been exercised before, but Parliament was now strong enough\r\nto insist upon the binding force of its enactments and to oblige\r\nCharles to withdraw his Indulgence. The fear of Catholicism ever\r\nincreased; gentlemen who at other times were quite rational gave\r\nunhesitating credence to wild tales of a \"Popish Plot\" (1678). In 1679\r\nan Exclusion Bill was brought forward which would debar Prince James\r\nfrom the throne, because of his conversion to Roman Catholicism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Whigs\"]\r\n\r\nIn the excitement over this latest assertion of parliamentary power,\r\n[Footnote: In the course of the debate over Exclusion, the\r\nparliamentary party won an important concession--the Habeas Corpus Act\r\nof 1679, which was designed to prevent arbitrary imprisonment.] two\r\ngreat factions were formed. The supporters of Exclusion were led by\r\ncertain great nobles who were jealous of the royal power, and were\r\nrecruited from merchants and shop-keepers who looked to Parliament to\r\nprotect their economic interests. Since many of the adherents of this\r\npolitical group were Dissenters, whose dislike of Anglicanism was\r\nexceeded only by their hatred of \"popery,\" the whole party was called\r\nby a nickname--\"Whig\"--which had formerly been applied to rebellious\r\nPresbyterians in Scotland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Tories\"]\r\n\r\nOpposed to the Whigs were the \"Tories\" [Footnote: Tory, a name applied\r\nto \"popish\" outlaws in Ireland.]--squires and country clergymen and all\r\nothers of an essentially conservative turn of mind. They were anxious\r\nto preserve the Church and state alike from Puritans and from\r\n\"papists,\" but most of all to prevent a recurrence of civil war. In the\r\nopinion of the Tories, the best and most effective safeguard against\r\nquarreling earls and insolent tradesmen was the hereditary monarchy.\r\nBetter submit to a Roman Catholic sovereign, they said, than invite\r\ncivil war by disturbing the regular succession. In the contest over the\r\nExclusion Bill, the Tories finally carried the day, for, although the\r\nbill was passed by the Commons (1680), it was rejected by the House of\r\nLords.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Temporary Success of the Tories]\r\n\r\nIn the last few years of Charles's reign the cause of the Whigs was\r\ndiscredited. Rumors got abroad that they were plotting to assassinate\r\nthe king and it was said that the Whiggish nobles who brought armed\r\nretainers to Parliament were planning to use force to establish\r\nCharles's illegitimate son--the duke of Monmouth--on the throne. These\r\nand similar accusations hurt the Whigs tremendously, and help explain\r\nthe violent Tory reaction which enabled Charles to rule without\r\nParliament from 1681 to his death in 1685. As had been feared, upon the\r\ndeath of Charles II, the duke of Monmouth organized a revolt, but this,\r\ntogether with a simultaneous insurrection in Scotland, was easily\r\ncrushed, and James II was securely seated on the throne.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"GLORIOUS REVOLUTION\" AND THE FINAL ESTABLISHMENT OF PARLIAMENTARY\r\nGOVERNMENT IN GREAT BRITAIN\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: James II (1685-1688): His Futile Combination of Absolutism\r\nand Roman Catholicism]\r\n\r\nIn his short reign of three years James II (1685-1688) succeeded in\r\nstirring up opposition on all sides. The Tories, the party most\r\nfavorable to the royal prerogative, upon whom he might have relied,\r\nwere shocked by his attempts to create a standing army commanded by\r\nCatholics, for such an army might prove as disastrous to their\r\nliberties as Cromwell's \"New Model\"; and the Whigs, too, were driven\r\nfrom sullenness to desperation by James's religious policy and despotic\r\ngovernment. James, like his brother, claiming the right to \"suspend\"\r\nthe laws and statutes which Parliament had enacted against Roman\r\nCatholics and Dissenters, issued a Declaration of Indulgence in 1687,\r\nwhich exempted Catholics and Dissenters from punishment for infractions\r\nof these laws. Furthermore, he appointed Roman Catholics to office in\r\nthe army and in the civil government. In spite of protests, he issued a\r\nsecond Declaration of Indulgence in 1688 and ordered it to be read in\r\nall Anglican churches, and, when seven bishops remonstrated, he accused\r\nthem of seditious libel. No jury would convict the seven bishops,\r\nhowever, for James had alienated every class, and they were acquitted.\r\nThe Tories were estranged by what seemed to be a deliberate attack on\r\nthe Anglican Church and by fear of a standing army. The arbitrary\r\ndisregard of parliamentary legislation, and the favor shown to Roman\r\nCatholics, goaded the Whigs into fury.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Glorious Revolution\" (1688): Dethronement of James II]\r\n\r\nSo long as Whigs and Tories alike could expect the accession on the\r\ndeath of James II of one of his Protestant daughters--Mary or Anne--\r\nthey continued to acquiesce in his arbitrary government. But the\r\noutlook became gloomier when on 10 June, 1688, a son was born to James\r\nII by his second wife, a Catholic. Most Protestants believed that the\r\nprince was not really James's son; politicians prophesied that he would\r\nbe educated in his father's \"popish\" and absolutist doctrines, and that\r\nthus England would continue to be ruled by papist despots. Even those\r\nwho professed to believe in the divine right of kings and had denied\r\nthe right of Parliament to alter the succession were dejected at this\r\nprospect, and many of them were willing to join with the Whigs in\r\ninviting a Protestant to take the throne. The next in line of\r\nsuccession after the infant prince was Mary, the elder of James's two\r\ndaughters, wife of William of Orange, [Footnote: See above, pp. 245,\r\n248] and an Anglican. Upon the invitation of Whig and Tory leaders,\r\nWilliam crossed over to England with an army and entered London without\r\nopposition (1688). Deserted even by his army James fled to France.\r\n[Footnote: Risings in favor of James were suppressed in Ireland and in\r\nScotland. In Ireland the famous battle of the Boyne (1 July, 1690) was\r\ndecisive.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Accession of William and Mary, 1689]\r\n[Sidenote: Constitutional Settlement: the Bill of Rights (1689) and\r\nTriumph of Parliament]\r\n[Sidenote: The Mutiny Act]\r\n\r\nA bloodless revolution was now accomplished and the crown was formally\r\npresented to William and Mary by an irregular Parliament, which also\r\ndeclared that James II, having endeavored to subvert the constitution\r\nand having fled the kingdom, had vacated the throne. In offering the\r\ncrown to William and Mary, Parliament was very careful to safeguard its\r\nown power and the Protestant religion by issuing a Declaration of\r\nRights (13 February, 1689), which was enacted as the Bill of Rights, 16\r\nDecember, 1689. This act decreed that the sovereign must henceforth\r\nbelong to the Anglican Church, thereby debarring the Catholic son of\r\nJames II. The act also denied the power of a king to \"suspend\" laws or\r\nto \"dispense\" subjects from obeying the laws, to levy money, or to\r\nmaintain an army without consent of Parliament; asserted that neither\r\nthe free election nor the free speech and proceedings of members of\r\nParliament should be interfered with; affirmed the right of subjects to\r\npetition the sovereign; and demanded impartial juries and frequent\r\nParliaments. The Bill of Rights, far more important in English history\r\nthan the Petition of Right (1628), inasmuch as Parliament was now\r\npowerful enough to maintain as well as to define its rights, was\r\nsupplemented by the practice, begun in the same year, 1689, of granting\r\ntaxes and making appropriations for the army for one year only. Unless\r\nParliament were called every year to pass a Mutiny Act (provision for\r\nthe army), the soldiers would receive no pay and in case of mutiny\r\nwould not be punishable by court martial.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Measures Favorable to Landlords]\r\n[Sidenote: Religious Toleration for Protestant Dissenters: Continued\r\nPersecution of Roman Catholics]\r\n\r\nBoth Whigs and Tories had participated in the Revolution, and both\r\nreaped rewards. The Tories were especially pleased with the army laws\r\nand with an arrangement by which farmers were given a \"bounty\" or money\r\npremium for every bushel of grain exported. [Footnote: That is, when\r\nwheat was selling for less than 6s. a bushel.] The Whigs, having played\r\na more prominent part in the deposition of James II, were able to\r\nsecure the long-coveted political supremacy of Parliament, and\r\nreligious toleration of Dissenters. The Toleration Act of 1689 did not\r\ngo as far as the Dissenters might have desired, but it gave them the\r\nlegal right to worship in public, while their enemies, the Roman\r\nCatholics, remained under the ban.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commercial Gains for England]\r\n[Sidenote: Union of England and Scotland: the Kingdom of Great Britain,\r\n1707]\r\n\r\nIn the foreign policy of the reigns of William (1689-1702) and Mary,\r\nand of Anne (1702-1714), Whiggish policies generally predominated. The\r\nmerchants and shippers who formed an important wing of the Whig party\r\nwere highly gratified by the Wars of the League of Augsburg and the\r\nSpanish Succession, [Footnote: See above, pp. 248 ff., and below, pp.\r\n306 ff.] in which England fought at once against France, her commercial\r\nand colonial rival, and against Louis XIV, the friend of the Catholic\r\nStuart pretenders to the English throne. [Footnote: Louis XIV openly\r\nsupported the pretensions of James (III), the \"Old Pretender.\"] The\r\nMethuen Treaty (1703) was also advantageous: it allowed English\r\nmerchants to sell their manufactures in Portugal without hindrance; in\r\nreturn for this concession England lowered the duties on Portuguese\r\nwines, and \"Port\" supplanted \"Burgundy\" on the tables of English\r\ngentlemen. The Act of Union of 1707 was not unfavorable either, for it\r\nestablished common trade regulations, customs, and excise in England\r\nand in Scotland. To the merely personal union between the crowns of\r\nEngland and Scotland which had been inaugurated (1603) by the first of\r\nthe Stuart monarchs of England now succeeded under the last of the\r\nStuart sovereigns a corporate union of the two monarchies under the\r\ntitle of the Kingdom of Great Britain (1707).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Accession of the Hanoverians (1714); Continued Decline of\r\nRoyal Power]\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Anne (1714), the crown passed [Footnote: In\r\naccordance with the Act of Settlement (1701).] to her cousin, the son\r\nof Sophia of Hanover, George I (1714-1727). The new king, unable even\r\nto speak the English language, much less to understand the complicated\r\ntraditions of parliamentary government, was neither able nor anxious to\r\nrule, but was content merely to reign. The business of administration,\r\ntherefore, was handed over to a group of ministers who strove not only\r\nto please their royal master but to retain the good-will of the\r\npredominant party in Parliament.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rise of the Cabinet]\r\n\r\nSince this practice, with the many customs which have grown up about\r\nit, has become a most essential part of the government of the United\r\nKingdom today, and has been copied in recent times by many other\r\ncountries, it is important to understand its early history. Even before\r\nthe accession of the Tudors, the Great Council of nobles and prelates\r\nwhich had advised and assisted early kings in matters of administration\r\nhad surrendered most of its actual functions to a score or so of \"Privy\r\nCouncilors.\" The Privy Council in turn became unwieldy, and allowed an\r\ninner circle or \"cabal\" of its most energetic members to direct the\r\nconduct of affairs. This inner circle was called a cabinet or cabinet\r\ncouncil, because it conferred with the king in a small private room\r\n(cabinet), and under the restored Stuarts it was extremely unpopular.\r\n\r\nWilliam III, more interested in getting money and troops to defend his\r\nnative Holland against Louis XIV than in governing England, allowed his\r\nministers free rein in most matters. So long as the Whigs held a\r\nmajority of the seats in the Commons, William found that the wheels of\r\ngovernment turned smoothly if all his ministers were Whigs. On the\r\nother hand, when the Tories gained a preponderance in the Commons, the\r\nWhig ministers were so distasteful to the new majority of the Commons\r\nthat it was necessary to replace them with Tories. Queen Anne, although\r\nher sincere devotion to Anglicanism inclined her to the Tories, was\r\nforced to appoint Whig ministers. Only toward the close of her reign\r\n(1710) did Anne venture to dismiss the Whigs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Era of Whig Domination, 1714-1761]\r\n[Sidenote: Robert Walpole and his Policies]\r\n\r\nUnder George I (1714-1727) it became customary for the king to absent\r\nhimself from cabinet-meetings. (It will be remembered that George could\r\nnot speak English.) This tended to make the cabinet even more\r\nindependent of the sovereign, as shown by the fact that Anne was the\r\nlast to use her prerogative to veto bills. From 1714 to 1761 was the\r\ngreat era of Whig domination. Both George I and George II naturally\r\nfavored the Whigs, because the Tories were supposed to desire a second\r\nrestoration of the Stuarts. Certainly many of the Tories had\r\nparticipated in the vain attempt of the \"Old Pretender\" in 1715 to seat\r\nhimself on the British throne as James III, and again in 1745 extreme\r\nTories took part in the insurrection in Scotland, gallantly led by the\r\nYoung Pretender, \"Prince Charlie\" the grandson of James II. Under these\r\ncircumstances practically all classes rallied to the support of the\r\nWhigs, who stood for the Protestant monarchy. Great Whig landowners\r\ncontrolled the rural districts, and the aristocracy of the towns was\r\nwon by the Whiggish policy of devotion to public credit and the\r\nprotection of commerce. The extensive and continued power of the Whigs\r\nmade it possible for Sir Robert Walpole, [Footnote: Created earl of\r\nOrford in 1742.] a great Whig leader, to hold office for twenty-one\r\nyears (1721-1742), jealously watching and maintaining his supremacy\r\nunder two sovereigns--George I (1714-1727) and George II (1727-1760).\r\nThough disclaiming the title, he was recognized by every one as the\r\n\"prime minister\"--prime in importance, prime in power. The other\r\nministers, nominally appointed by the sovereign, were in point of fact\r\ndependent upon him for office, and he, though nominally appointed by\r\nthe crown, was really dependent only upon the support of a Whig\r\nmajority in the Commons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: William Pitt, Earl of Chatham]\r\n\r\nWalpole's power was based on policy and political manipulation. His\r\npolicy was twofold, the maintenance of peace and of prosperity. We\r\nshall see elsewhere how he kept England clear of costly Continental\r\nwars. [Footnote: See above, p. 256, and below, pp. 309 ff., 324 f.] His\r\npolicy of prosperity was based on mercantilist ideas and consisted in\r\nstrict attention to business methods in public finance, [Footnote:\r\nWalpole was called the \"best master of figures of any man of his\r\ntime.\"] the removal of duties on imported raw materials, and on\r\nexported manufactures. In spite of the great prosperity of the period,\r\nthere was considerable criticism of Walpole's policy, and \"politics\"\r\nalone enabled him to persevere in it. By skillful partisan patronage,\r\nby bestowal of state offices and pensions upon members of Parliament,\r\nby open bribery, and by electioneering, he secured his ends and\r\nmaintained his majority in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nWalpole's successors,--Henry Pelham and the duke of Newcastle,--like\r\nhim represented the oligarchy of Whig nobles and millionaires, and even\r\noutdid him in corrupt methods. Another section of the Whig party under\r\nthe leadership of William Pitt the elder (the earl of Chatham) won\r\ngreat popularity by its condemnation of political \"graft.\" Pitt's fiery\r\ndemands for war first against Spain (1739-1748) and then against France\r\n(1756-1763) were echoed by patriotic squires and by the merchants who\r\nwished to ruin French commerce and to throw off the restrictions laid\r\nby Spain on American commerce. Pitt had his way until George III, a\r\nmonarch determined to destroy the power of the Whigs, appointed Tory\r\nministers, such as Lord Bute and Lord North. The attempt of George III\r\nto regain the power his great-grandfather had lost, to rule as well as\r\nto reign, was in the end a failure, and later Hanoverians might well\r\nhave joined George II in declaring that \"ministers are kings in this\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Significance of English Constitutional Development in the\r\nSeventeenth and Early Eighteenth Centuries]\r\n\r\nThis indeed is the salient fact in the evolution of constitutional\r\ngovernment in England. While in other countries late in the eighteenth\r\ncentury monarchs still ruled by divine right, in England Parliament and\r\nministers were the real rulers, and, in theory at least, they ruled by\r\nthe will of the people. That England was able to develop this form of\r\ngovernment may have been due in part to her insular position, her\r\nconstitutional traditions, and the ill-advised conduct of the Stuart\r\nkings, but most of all it was due to the great commercial and\r\nindustrial development which made her merchant class rich and powerful\r\nenough to demand and secure a share in government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Great Britain Parliamentarian but not Democratic]\r\n\r\nIn their admiration for the English government, many popular writers\r\nhave fallen into the error of confounding the struggle for\r\nparliamentary supremacy with the struggle for democracy. Nothing could\r\nbe more misleading. The \"Glorious Revolution\" of 1689 was a _coup\r\nd'état_ engineered by the upper classes, and the liberty it\r\npreserved was the liberty of nobles, squires, and merchants--not the\r\npolitical liberty of the common people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Unreformed Parliament]\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons was essentially undemocratic. Only one man in\r\nevery ten had even the nominal right to vote. It is estimated that from\r\n1760 to 1832 nearly one-half of the members owed their seats to\r\npatrons, and the reformed representatives of large towns were\r\nfrequently chosen by a handful of rich merchants. In fact, the\r\ngovernment was controlled by the upper class of society, and by only a\r\npart of that. No representatives sat for the numerous manufacturing\r\ntowns which had sprung into importance during the last few decades, and\r\nrich manufacturers everywhere complained that the country was being\r\nruined by the selfish administration of great landowners and commercial\r\naristocrats.\r\n\r\nCertain it is that the Parliament of the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies, while wonderfully earnest and successful in enriching\r\nEngland's landlords and in demolishing every obstacle to British\r\ncommerce, at the same time either willfully neglected or woefully\r\nfailed to do away with intolerance in the Church and injustice in the\r\ncourts, or to defend the great majority of the people from the greed of\r\nlandlords and the avarice of employers.\r\n\r\nDesigned as it was for the protection of selfish class interests, the\r\nEnglish government was nevertheless a step in the direction of\r\ndemocracy. The idea of representative government as expressed by\r\nParliament and cabinet was as yet very narrow, but it was capable of\r\nbeing expanded without violent revolution, slowly but inevitably, so as\r\nto include the whole people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOUSE OF STUART]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HANOVERIAN SOVEREIGNS OF GREAT BRITAIN (1714-1915)]\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL READING\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL.

But in\r\nthe seventeenth century the England of the Stuarts and the France of\r\nthe Bourbons found in colonies a refuge for their discontented or\r\nventuresome subjects, a source of profit for their merchants, a field\r\nfor the exercise of religious zeal, or gratification for national\r\npride. Everywhere were commerce and colonization growing apace, and\r\nespecially were they beginning to play a large part in the national\r\nlife of England and of France. We have already noticed how the Dutch,\r\nthemselves the despoilers of Portugal [Footnote: See above, pp. 58f] in\r\nthe first half of the seventeenth century, were in turn attacked by the\r\nEnglish in a series of commercial wars [Footnote: The Dutch Wars of\r\n1652-1654, 1665-1667, and 1672-1674. See above pp. 59, 243, 278.]\r\nduring the second half of the seventeenth century. By 1688 the period\r\nof active growth was past for the colonial empires of Holland,\r\nPortugal, and Spain; but England and France, beginning to realize the\r\npossibilities for power in North America, in India, and on the high\r\nseas, were just on the verge of a world conflict, which, after raging\r\nintermittently for more than a hundred years, was to leave Great\r\nBritain the \"mistress of the seas.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relative Position of the Rivals in 1688. In North America]\r\n\r\nBefore plunging into the struggle itself, let us review the position of\r\nthe two rivals in 1688: first, their claims and possessions in the New\r\nWorld and in the Old; secondly, their comparative resources and\r\npolicies. It will be remembered that the voyage of John Cabot (1497)\r\ngave England a claim to the mainland of North America. The Tudors\r\n(1485-1603), however, could not occupy so vast a territory, nor were\r\nthere any fences for the exclusion of intruders. Consequently the\r\nactual English settlements in North America, made wholly under the\r\nStuarts, [Footnote: However much modern Englishmen may condemn the\r\nefforts of the Stuart sovereigns to establish political absolutism at\r\nhome, they can well afford to praise these same royal Stuarts for\r\ncontributing powerfully to the foundations of England's commercial and\r\ncolonial greatness abroad.] were confined to Newfoundland, to a few fur\r\ndepots in the region of Hudson Bay, and to a strip of coastland from\r\nMaine to South Carolina; while the French not only had sent Verrazano\r\n(1524), who explored the coast of North America, and Cartier (1534-\r\n1536), who sailed up the St. Lawrence, but by virtue of voyages of\r\ndiscovery and exploration, especially that of La Salle (1682), laid\r\nclaim to the whole interior of the Continent.\r\n\r\nOf all the North American colonies, the most populous were those which\r\nlater became the United States. In the year 1688 there were ten of\r\nthese colonies. The oldest one, Virginia, had been settled in 1607 by\r\nthe London Company under a charter from King James I. Plymouth, founded\r\nin 1620 by the Pilgrims (Separatists or Independents driven from\r\nEngland by the enforcement of religious conformity to the Anglican\r\nChurch), was presently to be merged with the neighboring Puritan colony\r\nof Massachusetts. Near these first, New England settlements had grown\r\nup the colonies of Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Hampshire: Maine\r\nwas then a part of Massachusetts. Just as New England was the Puritans'\r\nrefuge, so Maryland, granted to Lord Baltimore in 1632, was a haven for\r\nthe persecuted Roman Catholics. A large tract south of Virginia, known\r\nas Carolina, had been granted to eight nobles in 1663; but it was\r\nprospering so poorly that its proprietors were willing to sell it to\r\nthe king in 1729 for a mere £50,000. The capture of the Dutch colony of\r\nNew Netherland [Footnote: Rechristened New York. It included New Jersey\r\nalso.] in 1664, and the settlement of Pennsylvania (1681) by William\r\nPenn and his fellow Quakers [Footnote: The Swedish colony on the\r\nDelaware was temporarily merged with Pennsylvania.] at last filled up\r\nthe gap between the North and the South.\r\n\r\nNumerous causes had contributed to the growth of the British colonies\r\nin America. Religious intolerance had driven Puritans to New England\r\nand Roman Catholics to Maryland; the success of the Puritan Revolution\r\nhad sent Cavaliers to Virginia; thousands of others had come merely to\r\nacquire wealth or to escape starvation. And America seemed a place\r\nwherein to mend broken fortunes. Upon the estates (plantations) of\r\nsouthern gentlemen negro slaves toiled without pay in the tobacco\r\nfields. [Footnote: Subsequently, rice and cotton became important\r\nproducts of Southern agriculture.] New England was less fertile, but\r\nshrewd Yankees found wealth in fish, lumber, and trade. No wonder,\r\nthen, that the colonies grew in wealth and in population until in 1688\r\nthere were nearly three hundred thousand English subjects in the New\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\nThe French settlers were far less numerous [Footnote: Probably not more\r\nthan 20,000 Frenchmen were residing in the New World in 1688. By 1750\r\ntheir number had increased perhaps to 60,000.] but more widespread.\r\nFrom their first posts in Acadia (1604) and Quebec (1608) they had\r\npushed on up the St. Lawrence. Jesuit and other Roman Catholic\r\nmissionaries had led the way from Montreal westward to Lake Superior\r\nand southward to the Ohio River. In 1682 the Sieur de La Salle, after\r\npaddling down the Mississippi, laid claim to the whole basin of that\r\nmighty stream, and named the region Louisiana in honor of Louis XIV of\r\nFrance. Nominally, at least, this territory was claimed by the English,\r\nfor in most of the colonial charters emanating from the English crown\r\nin the seventeenth century were clauses which granted lands \"from sea\r\nto sea\"--that is, from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The heart of \"New\r\nFrance\" remained on the St. Lawrence, but, despite English claims,\r\nFrench forts were commencing to mark the trails of French fur-traders\r\ndown into the \"Louisiana,\" and it was clear that whenever the English\r\ncolonists should cross the Appalachian Mountains to the westward they\r\nwould have to fight the French.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In West Indies]\r\n\r\nFrench and English were neighbors also in the West Indies. Martinique\r\nand Guadeloupe acknowledged French sovereignty, while Jamaica,\r\nBarbados, and the Bahamas were English.[Footnote: The following West\r\nIndies were also English: Nevis, Montserrat, Antigua, Honduras, St.\r\nLucia, Virgin Islands, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. St. Kitts was\r\ndivided between England and France; and the western part of Haiti,\r\nalready visited by French buccaneers, was definitely annexed to France\r\nin 1697. The Bermudas, lying outside the \"West Indies,\" were already\r\nEnglish.] These holdings in the West Indies were valuable not only for\r\ntheir sugar plantations, but for their convenience as stations for\r\ntrade with Mexico and South America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In Africa]\r\n\r\nIn Africa the French had made settlements in Madagascar, at Gorée, and\r\nat the mouth of the Senegal River, and the English had established\r\nthemselves in Gambia and on the Gold Coast, but as yet the African\r\nposts were mere stations for trade in gold-dust,[Footnote: Gold coins\r\nare still often called \"guineas\" in England, from the fact that a good\r\ndeal of gold used to come from the Guinea coast of Africa. ] ivory,\r\nwax, or slaves. The real struggle for Africa was not to come until the\r\nnineteenth and twentieth centuries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In India]\r\n\r\nOf far greater importance was Asiatic India, which, unlike America or\r\neven Africa, offered a field favorable for commerce rather than for\r\nconquest or for colonization. For it happened that the fertility and\r\nextent of India--its area was half as large as that of Europe--were\r\ntaxed to their uttermost to support a population of probably two\r\nhundred millions; and all, therefore, which Europeans desired was an\r\nopportunity to buy Indian products, such as cotton, indigo, Spices,\r\ndyes, drugs, silk, precious stones, and peculiar manufactures.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century India was ruled by a dynasty of Mohammedan\r\nemperors called Moguls,[Footnote: So called because racially they were\r\nfalsely supposed to be Mongols or Moguls.] who had entered the\r\npeninsula as conquerors in the previous century and had established a\r\nsplendid court in the city of Delhi on a branch of the Ganges. The bulk\r\nof the people, however, maintained their ancient \"Hindu\" religion with\r\ntheir social ranks or \"castes\" and preserved their distinctive speech\r\nand customs. Over a country like India, broken up into many sections by\r\nphysical features, climate, industries, and language, the Mohammedan\r\nconquerors,--the \"Great Mogul\" and his viceroys, called nawabs,\r\n[Footnote: More popularly \"nabobs.\"]--found it impossible to establish\r\nmore than a loose sovereignty, many of the native princes or \"rajas\"\r\nstill being allowed to rule with considerable independence, and the\r\nmillions of Hindus feeling little love or loyalty for their emperor. It\r\nwas this fatal weakness of the Great Mogul which enabled the European\r\ntraders, who in the seventeenth century besought his favor and\r\nprotection, to set themselves up in the eighteenth as his masters.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that after the voyage of Vasco da Gama the\r\nPortuguese had monopolized the trade with India and the East until they\r\nhad been attacked by the Dutch toward the close of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. This was the very time when the English were making their\r\nfirst voyages [Footnote: Actually the first English voyage to the East\r\nIndies was made between 1591 and 1594, almost a century after the first\r\nPortuguese voyage.] to the East and were taking advantage of their own\r\nwar with Philip II to attack his Portuguese possessions. The first\r\nEnglish trading stations were opened at Masulipatam (1611) and at Surat\r\n(1612). In the latter year and again in 1615 Portuguese fleets were\r\ndefeated, and in 1622 the Portuguese were driven out of the important\r\nPersian city of Ormuz. By 1688 the English had acquired three important\r\npoints in India, (1) Calcutta in the delta of the Ganges had been\r\noccupied in 1686, but it was yet uncertain whether the English could\r\nhold it against the will of the Mogul emperor. (2) At Madras, further\r\nsouth, Sir Francis Day had built Fort St. George (1640). (3) On the\r\nwestern coast, the trading station of Surat was now surpassed in value\r\nby Bombay, the dowry of Catherine of Braganza, a Portuguese princess,\r\nwho had married King Charles II (1662).\r\n\r\nThe first French Company for Eastern trade had been formed only four\r\nyears [Footnote: Charters to French companies had been granted in 1604\r\nand in 1615. The _Compagnie des Indes_ was formed in 1642, and\r\nreconstructed in 1664.] after the English East India Company, but the\r\nfirst French factory in India--at Surat--was not established until 1668\r\nand the French did not seriously compete with the English and Dutch in\r\nIndia until the close of the seventeenth century. However, their post\r\nat Chandarnagar (1672), in dangerous proximity to Calcutta, and their\r\nthriving station at Pondicherry (1674), within a hundred miles of\r\nMadras, augured ill for the future harmony of French and English in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comparative Resources of France and England]\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing brief review of the respective colonial possessions\r\nof Great Britain and France in the year 1688, it must now be clear that\r\nalthough France had entered the colonial competition tardily, she had\r\nsucceeded remarkably well in becoming a formidable rival of the\r\nEnglish. The great struggle for supremacy was to be decided,\r\nnevertheless, not by priority of settlement or validity of claim, but\r\nby the fighting power of the contestants. Strange as it may seem,\r\nFrance, a larger, more populous, and richer country than England, able\r\nthen single-handed to keep the rest of Europe at bay, was to prove the\r\nweaker of the two in the struggle for world empire.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, England's maritime power was increasing more\r\nirresistibly than that of France. Although Richelieu (1624-1642) had\r\nrecognized the need for a French navy and had given a great impetus to\r\nship-building, France had become inextricably entangled in European\r\npolitics, and the navy was half forgotten in the ambitious land wars of\r\nLouis XIV. The English, on the other hand, were predisposed to the sea\r\nby the very fact of their insularity, and since the days of the great\r\nArmada, their most patriotic boast had been of the deeds of mariners.\r\nIn the commercial wars with Holland, the first great English admiral--\r\nRobert Blake--had won glorious victories.\r\n\r\nThen, too, the Navigation Acts (1651, 1660), by excluding foreign ships\r\nfrom trade between Great Britain and the colonies, may have lessened\r\nthe volume of trade, but they resulted in undoubted prosperity for\r\nEnglish shippers. English shipbuilders, encouraged by bounties, learned\r\nto build stronger and more powerful vessels than those of other\r\nnations. Whether capturing galleons on the \"Spanish main\" or defeating\r\nPortuguese fleets in the Far East, English pirates, slavers, and\r\nmerchantmen were not to be encountered without fear or envy. English\r\ncommerce and industry, springing up under the protection and\r\nencouragement of the Tudors, had given birth, as we have seen, to a\r\nmiddle class powerful enough to secure special rights and privileges\r\nthrough Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe French, on the other hand, labored under most serious commercial\r\nhandicaps. Local tolls and internal customs-duties hindered traffic;\r\nand the medieval gild system had retained in France its power to hamper\r\nindustry with absurd regulations. The long civil and religious wars,\r\nwhich called workmen from their benches and endangered the property and\r\nlives of merchants, had resulted in reducing French commerce to a\r\nshadow before 1600. Under Henry IV prosperity revived, but the growth\r\nof royal power made it impossible for the Huguenot merchants in France\r\nto achieve political power comparable with that which the Puritans won\r\nin England. Consequently the mercantile classes were quite unable to\r\nprevent Louis XIV from ruining his country by foreign war,--they could\r\nnot vote themselves privileges and bounties as in England, nor could\r\nthey declare war on commercial rivals. True, Colbert (1662-1683), the\r\ngreat \"mercantilist\" minister, did his best to encourage new\r\nindustries, such as silk production, to make rules for the better\r\nconduct of old industries, and to lay taxes on such imported goods as\r\nmight compete with home products, but French industry could not be made\r\nto thrive like that of England. It is often said that Colbert's careful\r\nregulations did much harm by stifling the spirit of free enterprise;\r\nbut far more destructive were the wars and taxes [Footnote: In order to\r\nobtain money for his court, diplomacy, and wars, Louis XIV not only\r\nincreased taxes but debased the coinage. Particularly unfortunate,\r\neconomically, was the revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685), as a\r\nresult of which some 50,000 of the most industrious and thrifty\r\ncitizens of France fled to increase the industry of England, Holland,\r\nand Brandenburg (Prussia).] of the Grand Monarch. The only wonder is\r\nthat France bore the drain of men and money so well.\r\n\r\nThe English, then, had a more promising navy and a more prosperous\r\ntrade than the French, and were therefore able to gain control of the\r\nseas and to bear the expense of war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comparative Colonial Policies of France and England]\r\n\r\nIn general colonial policy France seemed decidedly superior. Louis XIV\r\nhad taken over the whole of \"New France\" as a royal province, and the\r\nFrench could present a united front against the divided and discordant\r\nEnglish colonies. Under Colbert the number of French colonists in\r\nAmerica increased 300 per cent in twenty years. Moreover the French,\r\nboth in India and in America, were almost uniformly successful in\r\ngaining the friendship and trust of the natives, whereas, at least with\r\nmost of the redmen, the English were constantly at war.\r\n\r\nThe English, however, had a great advantage in the number of colonists.\r\nThe population of France, held in check by wars, did not naturally\r\noverflow to America; and the Huguenots, persecuted in the mother\r\ncountry, were not allowed to emigrate to New France, lest their\r\npresence might impede the missionary labors of the Jesuits among the\r\nIndians. [Footnote: The statement is frequently made that the\r\n\"paternalism\" or fatherly care with which Richelieu and Colbert made\r\nregulations for the colonies was responsible for the paucity of\r\ncolonists and the discouragement of colonial industry. This, however,\r\nwill be taken with considerable reservation when it is remembered that\r\nEngland attempted to prevent the growth of such industries in her\r\ncolonies as might compete with those at home.] England was more\r\nfortunate in that her Puritan, Quaker, and Catholic exiles went to her\r\ncolonies rather than to foreign lands. The English colonists, less\r\nunder the direct protection of the mother country, learned to defend\r\nthemselves against the Indians, and were better able to help the mother\r\ncountry against their common foe, the French.\r\n\r\nTaken all in all, the situation was favorable to Great Britain. As long\r\nas French monarchs wasted the resources of France in Europe, they could\r\nscarcely hope to cope with the superior navy, the thriving commerce,\r\nand the more populous colonies, of their ancient enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY ENCOUNTERS, 1689-1748\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War of the League of Augsburg]\r\n\r\nColonial and commercial rivalry could hardly bring France and Great\r\nBritain to blows while the Stuart kings looked to Louis XIV for\r\nfriendly aid in the erection of absolutism and the reinstatement of\r\nCatholicism in England.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution of 1689, which we have already discussed [Footnote: See\r\nabove, pp. 286 ff.] in its political significance, was important in its\r\nbearing on foreign relations, for it placed on the English throne the\r\narch-enemy of France, William III, whose chief concern was the\r\nprotection of his ancestral possessions--the Dutch Netherlands--against\r\nthe encroachments of Louis XIV. The support given by the latter to the\r\npretensions of James II was a second cause of war. In an earlier\r\nchapter [Footnote: See above, pp. 247 ff.] we have seen how\r\ninternational relations in 1689 led to the juncture of England and\r\nHolland with the League of Augsburg, which included the emperor, the\r\nkings of Spain and Sweden, and the electors of Bavaria, Saxony, and the\r\nPalatinate; and how the resulting War of the League of Augsburg was\r\nwaged in Europe from 1689 to 1697. It was during that struggle, it will\r\nbe remembered, that King William finally defeated James II and the\r\nlatter's French and Irish allies in the battle of the Boyne (1690). It\r\nwas also during that struggle that the French navy, though successful\r\nagainst combined Dutch and English squadrons off Beachy Head (1690),\r\nwas decisively beaten by the English in a three-day battle near La\r\nHogue (1692).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: King William's War, 1689-1697]\r\n\r\nThe War of the League of Augsburg had its counterpart in the American\r\n\"King William's War,\" of which two aspects should be noted. In the\r\nfirst place, the New England colonists aided in the capture (1690) of\r\nthe French fortress of Port Royal in Acadia (Nova Scotia) and in an\r\ninconsequential attack on Quebec. In the second place, we must notice\r\nthe role of the Indians. As early as 1670, Roger Williams, a famous New\r\nEngland preacher, had declared, \"the French and Romish Jesuits, the\r\nfirebrands of the world, for their godbelly sake, are kindling at our\r\nback in this country their hellish fires with all the natives of this\r\ncountry.\" The outbreak of King William's War was a signal for the\r\nkindling of fires more to be feared than those imagined by the good\r\ndivine; the burning of Dover (N. H.), Schenectady (N. Y.), and Groton\r\n(Mass.) by the red allies of the French governor, Count Frontenac,\r\nearned the latter the lasting hatred of the \"Yankees.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treaty of Ryswick, 1697]\r\n\r\nThe contest was interrupted rather than settled by the colorless treaty\r\nof Ryswick (1697), according to which Louis XIV promised not to\r\nquestion William's right to the English throne, and all colonial\r\nconquests, including Port Royal, were restored.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War of the Spanish Succession]\r\n\r\nOnly five years later Europe was plunged into the long War of the\r\nSpanish Succession (1702-1713). King William and the Habsburg emperor\r\nwith other European princes formed a Grand Alliance to prevent Louis'\r\ngrandson Philip from inheriting the Spanish crowns. For if France and\r\nSpain were united under the Bourbon family, their armies would overawe\r\nEurope; their united colonial empires would surround and perhaps engulf\r\nthe British colonies; their combined navies might drive the British\r\nfrom the seas. Furthermore, the English were angered when Louis XIV,\r\nupon the death of James II (1701), openly recognized the Catholic son\r\nof the exiled royal Stuart as \"James III,\" king of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Queen Anne's War, 1702-1713]\r\n\r\nWhile the duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene were winning great\r\nvictories in Europe, [Footnote: See above, pp. 249 ff.] the British\r\ncolonists in America were fighting \"Queen Anne's War\" against the\r\nFrench. Again the French sent Indians to destroy New England villages,\r\nand again the English retaliated by attacking Port Royal and Quebec.\r\nAfter withstanding two unsuccessful assaults, Port Royal fell in 1710\r\nand left Acadia open to the British. In the following year a fleet of\r\nnine war vessels and sixty transports carried twelve thousand\r\nBritishers to attack Quebec, while an army of 2300 moved on Montreal by\r\nway of Lake Champlain; but both expeditions failed of their object.\r\n\r\nOn the high seas, as well as in America and in Europe, the British won\r\nfresh laurels. It was during Queen Anne's War that the British navy,\r\nsometimes with the valuable aid of the Dutch, played an important part\r\nin defeating the French fleet in the Mediterranean and driving French\r\nprivateers from the sea, in besieging and capturing Gibraltar, in\r\nseizing a rich squadron of Spanish treasure ships near Cartagena, and\r\nin terrorizing the French West Indies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treaty of Utrecht, 1713]\r\n\r\nThe main provisions of the treaty of Utrecht, which terminated this\r\nstage of the conflict, in so far as they affected the colonial of\r\nsituation, [Footnote: For the European settlement, see above, pp. 253\r\nf.] were as follows: (1) The French Bourbons, were allowed to become\r\nthe reigning family in Spain, and though the proviso was inserted that\r\nthe crowns of France and Spain should never be united, nevertheless so\r\nlong as Bourbons reigned in both countries, the colonies of Spain and\r\nFrance might almost be regarded as one immense Bourbon empire. (2)\r\nGreat Britain was confirmed in possession of Acadia, [Footnote: A\r\ndispute later arose whether, as the British claimed, \"Acadia\" included\r\nCape Breton Island.] which was rechristened Nova Scotia, and France\r\nabandoned her claims to Hudson Bay, Newfoundland, and the island of St.\r\nKitts in the West Indies. (3) Great Britain secured from Spain the\r\ncession of the island of Minorca and the rocky stronghold of Gibraltar\r\n--bulwarks of Mediterranean commerce. (4) Of more immediate value to\r\nGreat Britain was the trade concession, called the Asiento, made by\r\nSpain (1713). Prior to the Asiento, the British had been forbidden to\r\ntrade with the Spanish possessions in America, and the French had\r\nmonopolized the sale of slaves to the Spanish colonies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Asiento, 1713]\r\n\r\nThe Asiento, however, allowed Great Britain exclusive right to supply\r\nSpanish America with negro slaves, at the rate of 4800 a year, for\r\nthirty years. They were still forbidden to sell other commodities in\r\nthe domains of the Spanish king, except that once a year one British\r\nship of five hundred tons burden might visit Porto Bello on the Isthmus\r\nof Panama for purposes of general trade. For almost three decades after\r\nthe peace of Utrecht, the smoldering colonial jealousies were not\r\nallowed to break forth into the flame of open war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Interlude of Peace, 1713-1739]\r\n\r\nDuring the interval, however, British ambitions were coming more and\r\nmore obviously into conflict with the claims of Spain and France in\r\nAmerica, and with those of France in India.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French Aggressiveness in America]\r\n\r\nIn spite of her losses by the treaty of Utrecht, France still held the\r\nSt. Lawrence River, with Cape Breton Island defending its mouth; her\r\nfishermen still had special privileges on the Newfoundland banks; her\r\nislands in the West Indies flourished under greater freedom of trade\r\nthan that enjoyed by the English; and her pioneers were occupying the\r\nvast valley of the Mississippi. Moreover, in preparing for the next\r\nstage of the conflict, France displayed astonishing energy. Fort\r\nLouisburg was erected on Cape Breton Island to command the entrance to\r\nthe Gulf of St. Lawrence. A long series of fortifications was\r\nconstructed to stake out and guarantee the French claims. From Crown\r\nPoint on Lake Champlain, the line was carried westward by Fort Niagara,\r\nFort Detroit, Sault Sainte Marie, on to Lake Winnipeg and even beyond;\r\nother forts commanded the Wabash and Illinois rivers, and followed the\r\nMississippi down to the Gulf. [Footnote: By the year 1750 there were\r\nover sixty French forts between Montreal and New Orleans.] Settlements\r\nwere made at Mobile (1702) and at New Orleans (1718), and British\r\nsailors were given to understand that the Mississippi was French\r\nproperty. The governors of British colonies had ample cause for alarm.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French Aggressiveness in India: Dupleix]\r\n\r\nIn India, likewise, the French were too enterprising to be good\r\nneighbors. Under the leadership of a wonderfully able governor-general,\r\nDupleix, who was appointed in 1741, they were prospering and were\r\nextending their influence in the effete empire of the Great Mogul.\r\nDupleix exhibited a restless ambition; he began to interfere in native\r\npolitics and to assume the pompous bearing, gorgeous apparel, and proud\r\ntitles of a native prince. He conceived the idea of augmenting his\r\nslender garrisons of Europeans with \"sepoys,\" or carefully drilled\r\nnatives, and fortified his capital, Pondicherry, as if for war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Trade Disputes between Spain and Great Britain]\r\n\r\nTo the dangerous rivalry between British and French colonists and\r\ntraders in America and in India, during the thirty years which followed\r\nthe treaty of Utrecht, was added the continuous bickering which grew\r\nout of the Asiento concluded in 1713 between Great Britain and Spain.\r\nSpaniards complained of British smugglers and protested with justice\r\nthat the British outrageously abused their special privilege by keeping\r\nthe single stipulated vessel in the harbor of Porto Bello and refilling\r\nit at night from other ships. On the other hand, British merchants\r\nresented their general exclusion from Spanish markets and recited to\r\nwilling listeners at home the tale of their grievances against the\r\nSpanish authorities. Of such tales the most notorious was that of a\r\ncertain Captain Robert Jenkins, who with dramatic detail told how the\r\nbloody Spaniards had attacked his good ship, plundered it, and in the\r\nfray cut off one of his ears, and to prove his story he is said to have\r\nproduced a box containing what purported to be the ear in question. In\r\nthe face of the popular excitement aroused in England by this and\r\nsimilar incidents, Sir Robert Walpole, the peace-loving prime minister,\r\nwas unable to restrain his fellow-countrymen from declaring war against\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"War of Jenkins's Ear,\" 1739]\r\n\r\nIt was in 1739 that the commercial and colonial warfare was thus\r\nresumed,--on this occasion involving at the outset only Spain and Great\r\nBritain,--in a curious struggle commonly referred to as the War of\r\nJenkins's Ear. A British fleet captured Porto Bello, but failed to take\r\nCartagena. In North America the war was carried on fruitlessly by James\r\nOglethorpe, who had recently (1733) founded the English colony of\r\n\"Georgia\" [Footnote: So named in honor of the then reigning King George\r\nII (1727-1760)] to the south of the Carolinas, in territory claimed by\r\nthe Spanish colony of Florida.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War of the Austrian Succession. King George's War, 1744-\r\n1748]\r\n\r\nThe War of Jenkins's Ear proved but an introduction to the resumption\r\nof hostilities on a large scale between France and Great Britain. In a\r\nlater chapter [Footnote: See below, pp. 354 ff.] it is explained how in\r\n1740 the War of the Austrian Succession broke out on the continent of\r\nEurope--a war stubbornly fought for eight years, and a war in which\r\nGreat Britain entered the lists for Maria Theresa of Austria against\r\nFrance and Prussia and other states. And the European conflict was\r\nnaturally reflected in \"King George's War\" (1744-1748) in America, and\r\nin simultaneous hostilities in India.\r\n\r\nThe only remarkable incident of King George's War was the capture of\r\nLouisburg (1745) by Colonel William Pepperell of New Hampshire with a\r\nforce of British colonists, who were sorely disappointed when, in 1748,\r\nthe captured fortress was returned to France by the treaty of Aix-la-\r\nChapelle. The war in India was similarly indecisive. In 1746 a French\r\nsquadron easily captured the British post at Madras; other British\r\nposts were attacked, and Dupleix defeated the nawab of the Carnatic,\r\nwho would have punished him for violating Indian peace and neutrality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, 1748]\r\n\r\nThe tables were turned by the arrival of a British fleet in 1748, which\r\nlaid siege to Dupleix in Pondicherry. At this juncture, news arrived\r\nthat Great Britain and France had concluded the treaty of Aix-la-\r\nChapelle (1748), whereby all conquests, including Madras and Louisburg,\r\nwere to be restored. So far as Spain was concerned. Great Britain in\r\n1750 renounced the privileges of the Asiento in return for a money\r\npayment of £100,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIUMPH OF GREAT BRITAIN: THE SEVEN YEARS' WAR, 1756-1763\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Questions at Issue in 1750]\r\n[Sidenote: World-wide Extent of the Seven Years' War]\r\n\r\nUp to this point, the wars had been generally indecisive, although\r\nGreat Britain had gained Hudson Bay, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia by\r\nthe peace of Utrecht (1713). British naval power, too, was undoubtedly\r\nin the ascendancy. But two great questions were still unanswered.\r\nShould France be allowed to make good her claim to the Mississippi\r\nvalley and possibly to drive the British from their slender foothold on\r\nthe coast of America? Should Dupleix, wily diplomat as he was, be\r\nallowed to make India a French empire? To these major disputes was\r\nadded a minor quarrel over the boundary of Nova Scotia, which, it will\r\nbe remembered, had been ceded to Great Britain in 1713. Such questions\r\ncould be decided only by the crushing defeat of one nation, and that\r\ndefeat France was to suffer in the years between 1754 and 1763. Her\r\nloss was fourfold: (1) Her European armies were defeated in Germany by\r\nFrederick the Great, who was aided by English gold, in the Seven Years'\r\nWar (1756-1763). [Footnote: For an account of the European aspects of\r\nthis struggle, see below, pp. 358 ff.] (2) At the same time her naval\r\npower was almost annihilated by the British, whose war vessels and\r\nprivateers conquered most of the French West Indies and almost swept\r\nFrench commerce from the seas. (3) In India, the machinations of\r\nDupleix were foiled by the equally astute but more martial Clive. (4)\r\nIn America, the \"French and Indian War\" (1754-1763) dispelled the dream\r\nof a New France across the Atlantic. We shall first consider the war in\r\nthe New World.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The American Phase of the Seven Years' War: the \"French and\r\nIndian\" War, 1754-1763]\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause of the French and Indian War was a contest for the\r\npossession of the Ohio valley. The English had already organized an\r\nOhio Company (1749) for colonization of the valley, but they did not\r\nfully realize the pressing need of action until the French had begun\r\nthe construction of a line of forts in western Pennsylvania--Fort\r\nPresqu'Isle (Erie), Fort Le Buf (Waterford), and Fort Venango\r\n(Franklin). The most important position--the junction of the\r\nMonongahela and Allegheny rivers--being still unoccupied, the Ohio\r\nCompany, early in 1754, sent a small force to seize and fortify it. The\r\nFrench, however, were not to be so easily outwitted; they captured the\r\nnewly built fort with its handful of defenders, enlarged it, and\r\nchristened it Fort Duquesne in honor of the governor of Canada. Soon\r\nafterward a young Virginian, George Washington by name, arrived on the\r\nscene with four hundred men, too late to reënforce the English fort-\r\nbuilders, and he also was defeated on 4 July, 1754.\r\n\r\nHope was revived, however, in 1755 when the British General Braddock\r\narrived with a regular army and an ambitious plan to attack the French\r\nin three places--Crown Point (on Lake Champlain), Fort Niagara, and\r\nFort Duquesne. Against the last-named fort he himself led a mixed force\r\nof British regulars and colonial militia, and so incautiously did he\r\nadvance that presently he fell into an ambush. From behind trees and\r\nrocks the Frenchmen and redskins peppered the surprised redcoats. The\r\n\"seasoned\" veterans of European battlefields were defeated, and might\r\nhave been annihilated but for the timely aid of a few \"raw\" colonial\r\nmilitiamen, who knew how to shoot straight from behind trees. The\r\nexpedition against Niagara also failed of its object but entailed no\r\nsuch disaster. Failing to take Crown Point, the English built Forts\r\nEdward and William Henry on Lake George, while the French constructed\r\nthe famous Fort Ticonderoga. [Footnote: This same year, 1755, so\r\nunfortunate for the English, was a cruel year for the French settlers\r\nin Nova Scotia; like so many cattle, seven thousand of them were packed\r\ninto English vessels and shipped to various parts of North America. The\r\nEnglish feared their possible disloyalty.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Montcalm]\r\n\r\nThe gloom which gathered about British fortunes seemed to increase\r\nduring the years 1756 and 1757. Great Britain's most valuable ally,\r\nFrederick the Great of Prussia, was defeated in Europe; an English\r\nsquadron had been sadly defeated in the Mediterranean; the French had\r\ncaptured the island of Minorca; and a British attack on the French\r\nfortress of Louisburg had failed. To the French in America, the year\r\n1756 brought Montcalm and continued success. The Marquis de Montcalm\r\n(1712-1759) had learned the art of war on European battlefields, but he\r\nreadily adapted himself to new conditions, and proved to be an able\r\ncommander of the French and Indian forces in the New World. The English\r\nfort of Oswego on Lake Ontario, and Fort William Henry on Lake George,\r\nwere captured, and all the campaigns projected by the English were\r\nfoiled.\r\n\r\nIn 1757, however, new vigor was infused into the war on the part of the\r\nBritish, largely by reason of the entrance of William Pitt (the Elder)\r\ninto the cabinet. Pitt was determined to arouse all British subjects to\r\nfight for their country. Stirred with martial enthusiasm, colonial\r\nvolunteers now joined with British regulars to provide a force of about\r\n50,000 men for simultaneous attacks on four important French posts in\r\nAmerica--Louisburg, Ticonderoga, Niagara, and Duquesne. The success of\r\nthe attack on Louisburg (1758) was insured by the support of a strong\r\nBritish squadron; Fort Duquesne was taken and renamed Fort Pitt\r\n[Footnote: Whence the name of the modern city of Pittsburgh.] (1758);\r\nTiconderoga repulsed one expedition (1758) but surrendered on 26 July,\r\n1759, one day after the capture of Fort Niagara by the British.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wolfe]\r\n\r\nNot content with the capture of the menacing French frontier forts, the\r\nBritish next aimed at the central strongholds of the French. While one\r\narmy marched up the Hudson valley to attack Montreal, General Wolfe, in\r\ncommand of another army of 7000, and accompanied by a strong fleet,\r\nmoved up the St. Lawrence against Quebec. An inordinate thirst for\r\nmilitary glory had been Wolfe's heritage from his father, himself a\r\ngeneral. An ensign at fourteen, Wolfe had become an officer in active\r\nservice while still in his teens, had commanded a detachment in the\r\nattack on Louisburg in 1758, and now at the age of thirty-three was\r\ncharged with the capture of Quebec, a natural stronghold, defended by\r\nthe redoubtable Montcalm. The task seemed impossible; weeks were wasted\r\nin futile efforts; sickness and apparent defeat weighed heavily on the\r\nyoung commander. With the energy of despair he fastened at last upon a\r\ndaring idea. Thirty-six hundred of his men were ferried in the dead of\r\nnight to a point above the city where his soldiers might scramble\r\nthrough bushes and over rocks up a precipitous path to a high plain--\r\nthe Plains of Abraham--commanding the town.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British Victory at Quebec, 1759]\r\n\r\nWolfe's presence on the heights was revealed at daybreak on 13\r\nSeptember, 1759, and Montcalm hastened to repel the attack. For a time\r\nit seemed as if Wolfe's force would be over-powered, but a well-\r\ndirected volley and an impetuous charge threw the French lines into\r\ndisorder. In the moment of victory, General Wolfe, already twice\r\nwounded, received a musket-ball in the breast. His death was made happy\r\nby the news of success, but no such exultation filled the heart of the\r\nmortally wounded Montcalm, dying in the bitterness of defeat.\r\n\r\nQuebec surrendered a few days later. It was the beginning of the end of\r\nthe French colonial empire in America. All hope was lost when, in\r\nOctober, 1759, a great armada, ready to embark against England, was\r\ndestroyed in Quiberon Bay by Admiral Hawke. In 1760 Montreal fell and\r\nthe British completed the conquest of New France, at the very time when\r\nthe last vestiges of French power were disappearing in India.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Futile Intervention of Spain, 1762]\r\n\r\nIn his extremity, Louis XV of France secured the aid of his Bourbon\r\nkinsman, the king of Spain, against England, but Spain was a worthless\r\nally, and in 1762 British squadrons captured Cuba and the Philippine\r\nIslands as well as the French possessions in the West Indies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Phase of the Seven Years' War in India]\r\n[Sidenote: Continued Activity of Dupleix]\r\n\r\nLet us now turn back and see how the loss of New France was paralleled\r\nby French defeat in the contest for the vastly more populous and\r\nopulent empire of India. The Mogul Empire, to which reference has\r\nalready been made, had been rapidly falling to pieces throughout the\r\nfirst half of the eighteenth century. The rulers or nawabs (nabobs) of\r\nthe Deccan, of Bengal, and of Oudh had become semi-independent princes.\r\nIn a time when conspiracy and intrigue were common avenues to power,\r\nthe French governor, Dupleix, had conceived the idea of making himself\r\nthe political leader of India, and in pursuit of his goal, as we have\r\nseen, he had affected Oriental magnificence and grandiloquent titles,\r\nhad formed alliances with half the neighboring native magnates, had\r\nfortified Pondicherry, and begun the enrollment and organization of his\r\nsepoy army. In 1750 he succeeded in overthrowing the nawab of the\r\nCarnatic [Footnote: The province in India which includes Madras and\r\nPondicherry and has its capital at Arcot.] and in establishing a\r\npretender whom he could dominate more easily.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Robert Clive]\r\n[Sidenote: French Failure in the Carnatic]\r\n\r\nThe hopes of the experienced and crafty Dupleix were frustrated,\r\nhowever, by a young man of twenty-seven--Robert Clive. At the age of\r\neighteen, Clive had entered the employ of the English East India\r\nCompany as a clerk at Madras. His restless and discontented spirit\r\nfound relief, at times, in omnivorous reading; at other times he grew\r\ndespondent. More than once he planned to take his own life. During the\r\nWar of the Austrian Succession, he had resigned his civil post and\r\nentered the army. The hazards of military life were more to his liking,\r\nand he soon gave abundant evidence of ability. After the peace of 1748\r\nhe had returned to civil life, but in 1751 he came forward with a bold\r\nscheme for attacking Arcot, the capital of the Carnatic, and\r\noverthrowing the upstart nawab who was supported by Dupleix. Clive\r\ncould muster only some two hundred Europeans and three hundred sepoys,\r\nbut this slender force, infused with the daring and irresistible\r\ndetermination of the young leader, sufficed to seize and hold the\r\ncitadel of Arcot against thousands of assailants. With the aid of\r\nnative and British reënforcements, the hero of Arcot further defeated\r\nthe pretender; and, in 1754, the French had to acknowledge their\r\nfailure in the Carnatic and withdraw support from their vanquished\r\nprotégé. Dupleix was recalled to France in disgrace; and the British\r\nwere left to enjoy the favor of the nawab who owed his throne to Clive.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Plassey]\r\n[Sidenote: British Success in India]\r\n\r\nClive's next work was in Bengal. In 1756 the young nawab of Bengal,\r\nSuraj-ud-Dowlah by name, seized the English fort at Calcutta and locked\r\n146 Englishmen overnight in a stifling prison--the \"Black Hole\" of\r\nCalcutta--from which only twenty-three emerged alive the next morning.\r\nClive, hastening from Madras, chastised Suraj for this atrocity, and\r\nforced him to give up Calcutta. And since by this time Great Britain\r\nand France were openly at war, Clive did not hesitate to capture the\r\nnear-by French post of Chandarnagar. His next move was to give active\r\naid to a certain Mir Jafir, a pretender to the throne of the unfriendly\r\nSuraj-ud-Dowlah. The French naturally took sides with Suraj against\r\nClive. In 1757 Clive drew up 1100 Europeans, 2100 sepoys, and nine\r\ncannon in a grove of mango trees at Plassey, a few miles south of the\r\ncity of Murshidabad, and there attacked Suraj, who, with an army of\r\n68,000 native troops and with French artillerymen to work his fifty-\r\nthree cannon, anticipated an easy victory. The outcome was a brilliant\r\nvictory for Clive, as overwhelming as it was unexpected. The British\r\ncandidate forthwith became nawab of Bengal and as token of his\r\nindebtedness he paid over £1,500,000 to the English East India Company,\r\nand made Clive a rich man. The British were henceforth dominant in\r\nBengal. The capture of Masulipatam in 1758, the defeat of the French at\r\nWandewash, between Madras and Pondicherry, and the successful siege of\r\nPondicherry in 1761, finally established the British as masters of all\r\nthe coveted eastern coast of India.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Treaty of Paris, 1763]\r\n\r\nThe fall of Quebec (1759) and of Pondicherry (1761) practically decided\r\nthe issue of the colonial struggle, but the war dragged on until, in\r\n1763, France, Spain, and Great Britain concluded the peace of Paris. Of\r\nher American possessions France retained only two insignificant islands\r\non the Newfoundland coast, [Footnote: St. Pierre and Miquelon.] a few\r\nislands in the West Indies, [Footnote: Including Guadeloupe and\r\nMartinique.] and a foothold in Guiana in South America. Great Britain\r\nreceived from France the whole of the St. Lawrence valley and all the\r\nterritory east of the Mississippi River, together with the island of\r\nGrenada in the West Indies; and from Spain, Great Britain secured\r\nFlorida. Beyond the surrender of the sparsely settled territory of\r\nFlorida, Spain suffered no loss, for Cuba and the Philippines were\r\nrestored to her, and France gave her western Louisiana, that is, the\r\nwestern half of the Mississippi valley. The French were allowed to\r\nreturn to their old posts in India, but were not to maintain troops in\r\nBengal or to build any fort. In other words, the French returned to\r\nIndia as traders but not as empire builders. [Footnote: During the war,\r\nthe French posts in Africa had been taken, and now Gorée was returned\r\nwhile the mouth of the Senegal River was retained by the British.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Significance of the Seven Years' War to Great Britain and\r\nFrance]\r\n\r\nLet us attempt to summarize the chief results of the war. In the first\r\nplace, Great Britain preserved half of what was later to constitute the\r\nUnited States, and gained Canada and an ascendancy in India--empires\r\nwider, richer, and more diverse than those of a Cæsar or an Alexander.\r\nHenceforth Great Britain was indisputably the preëminent colonizing\r\ncountry--a nation upon whose domains the sun never set. It meant that\r\nthe English language was to spread as no other language, until to-day\r\none hundred and sixty millions of people use the tongue which in the\r\nfifteenth century was spoken by hardly five millions.\r\n\r\nSecondly, even more important than this vast land empire was the\r\ndominion of the sea which Great Britain acquired, for from the series\r\nof wars just considered, and especially from the last, dates the\r\nmaritime supremacy of England. Since then her commerce, protected and\r\nadvertised by the most powerful navy in the world, has mounted by leaps\r\nand bounds, so that now half the vessels which sail the seas bear at\r\ntheir masthead the Union Jack. From her dominions beyond the oceans and\r\nfrom her ships upon the seas Great Britain drew power and prestige;\r\nBritish merchants acquired opulence with resulting social and political\r\nimportance to themselves and to their country, and British manufactures\r\nreceived that stimulation which prepared the way for the Industrial\r\nRevolution of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the gains of Great Britain were at least the temporary ruin of\r\nher rival. Not without reluctance did France abandon her colonial\r\nambitions, but nearly a century was to elapse after the treaty of Paris\r\nbefore the French should seriously reënter the race for the upbuilding\r\nof world empire. Nor was France without a desire for revenge, which was\r\nsubsequently made manifest in her alliance with Britain's rebellious\r\nAmerican colonies in 1778. But French naval power had suffered a blow\r\nfrom which it was difficult to recover, [Footnote: Yet between 1763 and\r\n1778 the French made heroic and expensive efforts to rebuild their\r\nnavy. And as we shall presently see in studying the general war which\r\naccompanied the American revolt, France attempted in vain to reverse\r\nthe main result of the Seven Years' War.] and much of her commerce was\r\nirretrievably lost. If toward the close of the eighteenth century\r\nbankruptcy was to threaten the Bourbon court and government at\r\nVersailles, and if at the opening of the next century, British sea-\r\npower was to undermine Napoleon's empire, it was in no slight degree\r\nthe result in either case of the Seven Years' disaster.\r\n\r\nIndia and America were lost to France. Her trade in India soon dwindled\r\ninto insignificance before the powerful and wealthy British East India\r\nCompany. \"French India\" to-day consists of Pondicherry, Karikal,\r\nYanaon, Mahé, and Chandarnagar--196 square miles in all,--while the\r\nIndian Empire of Britain spreads over an area of 1,800,000 square\r\nmiles. French empire in America is now represented only by two puny\r\nislands off the coast of Newfoundland, two small islands in the West\r\nIndies, and an unimportant tract of tropical Guiana, but historic\r\ntraces of its former greatness and promise have survived alike in\r\nCanada and in Louisiana. In Canada the French population has stubbornly\r\nheld itself aloof from the British in language and in religion, and\r\neven to-day two of the seven millions of Canadians are Frenchmen, quite\r\nas intent on the preservation of their ancient nationality as upon\r\ntheir allegiance to the British rule. In the United States the French\r\nelement is less in evidence; nevertheless in New Orleans sidewalks are\r\ncalled \"banquettes,\" and embankments, \"levées\"; and still the names of\r\nSt. Louis, Des Moines, Detroit, and Lake Champlain perpetuate the\r\nmemory of a lost empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL READING\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL.

We may properly leave\r\nto American history the details of the process by which, as the\r\ncolonies became more acutely conscious of the inherent conflict between\r\ntheir economic interests and the colonial and commercial policy of\r\nGreat Britain, they grew at the same time into a self-confident and\r\ndefiant independence. Nevertheless, as an epochal event in the history\r\nof British imperialism, the American War of Independence deserves a\r\nprominent place in European history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mercantilism and the British Colonies]\r\n\r\nThe germs of disease were imbedded in the very policy to which many\r\nstatesmen of the eighteenth century ascribed England's great career,--\r\nthe mercantilist theories, whose acquaintance we made in an earlier\r\nchapter. [Footnote: See above, pp. 63 ff, and likewise pp. 239 f.] The\r\nmercantilist statesman, anxious to build up the power, and therefore\r\nthe wealth, of his country, logically conceived three main ideas about\r\ncolonies: (1) they should furnish the mother country with commodities\r\nwhich could not be produced at home; (2) they should not injure the\r\nmother country by competing with her industries or by enriching her\r\ncommercial rivals; and (3) they should help bear the burdens of the\r\ngovernment, army, and navy. Each one of these ideas was reflected in\r\nthe actual policy which the British government in the eighteenth\r\ncentury adopted and enforced in respect of the American colonies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Regulation of Colonial Industry. Bounties]\r\n\r\n(1) Various expedients were employed to encourage the production of\r\nparticular colonial commodities which the British Parliament thought\r\ndesirable. The commodity might be exempted from customs duties, or\r\nParliament might forbid the importation into Great Britain of similar\r\nproducts from foreign countries, or might even bestow outright upon the\r\ncolonial producer \"bounties,\" or sums of money, as an incentive to\r\npersevere in the industry. Thus the cultivation of indigo in Carolina,\r\nof coffee in Jamaica, of tobacco in Virginia, was encouraged, so that\r\nthe British would not have to buy these desirable commodities from\r\nSpain. Similarly, bounties were given for tar, pitch, hemp, masts, and\r\nspars imported from America rather than from Sweden.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Restrictions on Colonial Industry]\r\n\r\n(2) The chief concern of the mercantilist was the framing of such\r\ngovernmental regulations of trade as would deter colonial commerce or\r\nindustry from taking a turn which conceivably might lessen the\r\nprosperity of the British manufacturers or shippers, on whom Parliament\r\ndepended for taxes. Of the colonial industries which were discouraged\r\nfor this reason, two or three are particularly noteworthy. Thus the hat\r\nmanufacturers in America, though they could make hats cheaply, because\r\nof the plentiful supply of fur in the New World, were forbidden to\r\nmanufacture any for export, lest they should ruin the hatters of\r\nLondon. The weaving of cloth was likewise discouraged by a law of 1699\r\nwhich prohibited the export of woolen fabrics from one colony to\r\nanother. Again, it was thought necessary to protect British iron-\r\nmasters by forbidding (1750) the colonists to manufacture wrought iron\r\nor its finished products. Such restrictions on manufacture were\r\nimposed, not so much for fear of actual competition in the English\r\nmarket, as to keep the colonial markets for English manufacturers. They\r\ncaused a good deal of rancor, but they were too ill enforced to bear\r\nheavily upon the colonies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Restrictions on Colonial Trade]\r\n\r\nMore irksome were the restrictions on commerce. As far back as 1651,\r\nwhen Dutch traders were bringing spices from the East and sugar from\r\nthe West to sell in London at a handsome profit, Parliament had passed\r\nthe first famous Navigation Act, [Footnote: See above, pp. 277 f., 304\r\nf.] which had been successful in its general design--to destroy the\r\nDutch carrying trade and to stimulate British ship-building. In the\r\neighteenth century a similar policy was applied to the colonies. For it\r\nwas claimed that the New England traders who sold their fish and lumber\r\nfor sugar, molasses, and rum in the French West Indies were enriching\r\nFrench planters rather than English. Consequently, a heavy tariff was\r\nlaid on French sugar-products. Moreover, inasmuch as it was deemed most\r\nessential for a naval power to have many and skilled ship-builders, the\r\nNavigation Acts [Footnote: Subsequent to the Act of 1651, important\r\nNavigation Acts were passed in 1660, 1663, 1672, and 1696.] were so\r\ndeveloped and expanded as to include the following prescriptions: (1)\r\nIn general all import and export trade must be conducted in ships built\r\nin England, in Ireland, or in the colonies, manned and commanded by\r\nBritish subjects. Thus, if a French or Dutch merchantman appeared in\r\nMassachusetts Bay, offering to sell at a great bargain his cargo of\r\nspices or silks, the shrewd merchants of Boston were legally bound not\r\nto buy of him. (2) Certain \"enumerated\" articles, such as sugar,\r\ntobacco, cotton, indigo, and, later, rice and furs, could be exported\r\nonly to England. A Virginia planter, wishing to send tobacco to a\r\nFrench snuff-maker, would have to ship it to London in an English ship,\r\npay duties on it there, and then have it reshipped to Havre. (3) All\r\ngoods imported into the American colonies from Europe must come by way\r\nof England and must pay duties there. Silks might be more expensive\r\nafter they had paid customs duties in London and had followed a\r\nroundabout route to Virginia, but the proud colonial dame was supposed\r\nto pay dearly and to rejoice that English ships and English sailors\r\nwere employed in transporting her finery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reasons for Early Colonial Toleration of Restrictions on the\r\nIndustry and Trade]\r\n\r\nIt would seem as if such restrictive measures would not have been\r\ntolerated in the colonies, even when imposed by the mother country.\r\nThere were, however, several very good reasons why the trade\r\nrestrictions were long tolerated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Leniency of Enforcement]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, for many years they had been very poorly enforced.\r\nDuring his long ministry, from 1721 to 1742, Sir Robert Walpole had\r\nwinked at infractions of the law and had allowed the colonies to\r\ndevelop as best they might under his policy of \"salutary neglect.\"\r\nThen, during the colonial wars, it had been inexpedient and impossible\r\nto insist upon the Navigation Acts; and smuggling had become so common\r\nthat respectable merchants made no effort to conceal their traffic in\r\ngoods which had been imported contrary to provisions of the law.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fear of the French]\r\n\r\nMoreover, the colonies would gladly endure a good deal of economic\r\nhardship in order to have the help of the mother country against the\r\nFrench. So long as Count de Frontenac and his successors were sending\r\ntheir Indians southward and eastward to burn New England villages, it\r\nwas very comforting to think that the mother country would send armies\r\nof redcoats to conquer the savages and defeat the French.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Weakness and Disunion of the Thirteen Colonies]\r\n\r\nBut even had there been every motive for armed resistance to Great\r\nBritain, the American colonies could hardly have attempted it until\r\nafter the conclusion of the French and Indian War. Until the second\r\nhalf of the eighteenth century the British colonies were both weak and\r\ndivided. They had no navy and very few fortifications to defend their\r\ncoastline. They had no army except raw and unreliable militia. Even in\r\n1750 their inhabitants numbered but a paltry 1,300,000 as compared with\r\na population in Great Britain of more than 10,000,000; and in wealth\r\nand resources they could not dream of rivaling the mother country.\r\n\r\nThe lack of union among the colonies sprang from fundamental\r\nindustrial, social, and religious differences. The southern provinces--\r\nGeorgia, the Carolinas, and Virginia--were agricultural, and their\r\nproducts were plantation-grown rice, indigo, and tobacco. New York and\r\nPennsylvania produced corn and timber. In New England, although there\r\nwere many small farmers, the growing interest was in trade and\r\nmanufacture. The social distinctions were equally marked. The northern\r\ncolonists were middle-class traders and small farmers, with democratic\r\ntown governments, and with an intense pride in education. In the South,\r\ngentlemen of good old English families lived like feudal lords among\r\ntheir slaves and cultivated manners quite as assiduously as morals. Of\r\nforms of the Christian religion, the Atlantic coast presented a bizarre\r\nmixture. In the main, New England was emphatically Calvinistic and\r\nsternly Puritanical; Virginia, proudly Episcopalian (Anglican); and\r\nMaryland, partly Roman Catholic. Plain-spoken Quakers in Pennsylvania,\r\nPresbyterians and Baptists in New Jersey, and German Lutherans in\r\nCarolina added to the confusion.\r\n\r\nBetween colonies so radically different in religion, manners, and\r\nindustries, there could be at the outset little harmony or cooperation.\r\nIt would be hard to arouse them to concerted action, and even harder to\r\nconduct a war. Financial cooperation was impeded by the fact that the\r\npaper money issued by any one colony was not worth much in the others.\r\nMilitary cooperation was difficult because while each colony might call\r\non its farmers temporarily to join the militia in order to repel an\r\nIndian raid, the militia-men were always anxious to get back to their\r\ncrops and would obey a strange commander with ill grace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Altered Situation in the Thirteen Colonies after 1763]\r\n\r\nWith the conclusion of the French and Indian War, however, conditions\r\nwere materially changed, (1) The fear of the French was no longer\r\npresent to bind the colonies to the mother country. (2) During the wars\r\nthe colonies had grown not only more populous (they numbered about\r\n2,000,000 inhabitants in 1763) and more wealthy, but also more self-\r\nconfident. Recruits from the northern colonies had captured Louisburg\r\nin 1745 and had helped to conquer Canada in the last French war.\r\nVirginia volunteers had seen how helpless were General Braddock's\r\nredcoats in forest-warfare. Experiences like these gave the provincial\r\nriflemen pride and confidence. Important also was the Albany Congress\r\nof 1754, in which delegates from seven colonies came together and\r\ndiscussed Benjamin Franklin's scheme for federating the thirteen\r\ncolonies. Although the plan was not adopted, it set men to thinking\r\nabout the advantages of confederation and so prepared the way for\r\nsubsequent union.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: More Rigorous Attitude of Great Britain toward the Colonies\r\nafter Accession of George III, 1760]\r\n\r\nNot only were the colonists in a more independent frame of mind, but\r\nthe British government became more oppressive. During two reigns--those\r\nof George I and George II--ministers had been the power behind the\r\nthrone, but in 1760 George III had come to the throne as an\r\ninexperienced and poorly educated youth of twenty-two, full of ambition\r\nto be the power behind the ministers. Not without justice have\r\nhistorians accused George III of prejudice, stubbornness, and\r\nstupidity. Nevertheless, he had many friends. The fact that he, the\r\nfirst really English king since the Revolution of 1688, should manifest\r\na great personal interest and industry in affairs of state, endeared\r\nhim to many who already respected his irreproachable private morality\r\nand admired his flawless and unfailing courtesy. Under the inspiration\r\nof Lord Bute, [Footnote: The earl of Bute (1713-1792) became prime\r\nminister in 1762, after the resignations of Pitt, who had been the real\r\nhead of the cabinet, and the duke of Newcastle, who had been the\r\nnominal premier. Bute in turn was succeeded by George Grenville (1712-\r\n1770).] the \"king's friends\" became a political party, avowedly intent\r\non breaking the power of the great Whig noblemen who had so long\r\ndominated corrupt Parliaments and unscrupulous ministries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Grenville, Prime Minister, 1763-1765, Executor of the\r\nColonial Policies of George III]\r\n\r\nGeorge III attempted at the outset to gain control of Parliament by\r\nwholesale bribery of its members, but, since even this questionable\r\nexpedient did not give him a majority, he tried dividing the forces of\r\nhis Whig opponents. This was somewhat less difficult since Pitt, the\r\nmost prominent Whig, the eloquent Chauvinist [Footnote: Chauvin, a\r\nsoldier in Napoleon's army, was so enthusiastic for the glory of the\r\ngreat general that his name has since been used as an adjective\r\ndenoting excessive patriotism and fondness for war.] minister, \"friend\r\nof the colonies,\" and idol of the cities, had lost control of the\r\nministry. England, too, felt the burdensome expense of war, and the\r\npublic debt had mounted to what was then the enormous sum of\r\n£140,000,000. George III, therefore, chose for prime minister (1763-\r\n1765) George Grenville, a representative of a faction of Whig\r\naristocrats, who, alarmed by the growth of the public debt, and jealous\r\nof Pitt's power, were quite willing to favor the king's colonial\r\npolicies. Great Britain, they argued, had undergone a costly war to\r\ndefend the colonists on the Atlantic coast from French aggression. The\r\ncolonies were obviously too weak and too divided to garrison and police\r\nthe great Mississippi and St. Lawrence valleys; and yet, in order to\r\nprevent renewed danger from French, Spaniards, or Indians, at least ten\r\nthousand regular soldiers would be needed at an annual expense of\r\n£300,000. What could be more natural than that the colonists, to whose\r\nbenefit the war had redounded, and to whose safety the army would add,\r\nshould pay at least a part of the expense? This idea, put forward by\r\ncertain Whig statesmen, that the colonists should bear part of the\r\nfinancial burden of imperial defense, was eagerly seized upon by George\r\nIII and utilized as the cornerstone of his colonial policy. To such a\r\npolicy the Tories, as ardent upholders of the monarchy, lent their\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sugar Act, 1764]\r\n\r\nGrenville, the new minister, accordingly proposed that the colonists\r\nshould pay about £150,000 a year,--roughly a half of the estimated\r\ntotal amount,--and for raising the money, he championed two special\r\nfinance acts in the British Parliament. The first was the Sugar Act of\r\n1764. Grenville recognized that a very high tariff on the importation\r\nof foreign sugar-products into the colonies invited smuggling on a\r\nlarge scale, was therefore generally evaded, and yielded little revenue\r\nto the government. As a matter of fact, in the previous year,\r\nMassachusetts merchants had smuggled 15,000 hogsheads of molasses\r\n[Footnote: Large quantities of molasses were used in New England for\r\nthe manufacture of rum.] from the French West Indies. Now, in\r\naccordance with the new enactment, the duty was actually halved, but a\r\nserious attempt was made to collect what remained. For the purpose of\r\nthe efficient collection of the sugar tax, the Navigation Acts were\r\nrevived and enforced; British naval officers were ordered to put a\r\nperemptory stop to smuggling; and magistrates were empowered to issue\r\n\"writs of assistance\" enabling customs collectors to search private\r\nhouses for smuggled goods. The Sugar Act was expected to yield one-\r\nthird of the amount demanded by the British ministry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Stamp Act, 1765]\r\n[Sidenote: Opposition in the Colonies]\r\n\r\nThe other two-thirds of the £150,000 was to be raised under the Stamp\r\nAct of 1765. Bills of lading, official documents, deeds, wills,\r\nmortgages, notes, newspapers, and pamphlets were to be written or\r\nprinted only on special stamped paper, on which the tax had been paid.\r\nPlaying cards paid a stamp tax of a shilling; dice paid ten shillings;\r\nand on a college diploma the tax amounted to £2. The Stamp Act bore\r\nheavily on just the most dangerous classes of the population--\r\nnewspaper-publishers, pamphleteers, lawyers, bankers, and merchants.\r\nNaturally the newspapers protested and the lawyers argued that the\r\nStamp Act was unconstitutional, that Parliament had no right to levy\r\ntaxes on the colonies. The very battle-cry, \"Taxation without\r\nRepresentation is Tyranny,\" was the phrase of a Boston lawyer, James\r\nOtis.\r\n\r\nAt once the claim was made that the colonists were true British\r\nsubjects and that taxation without representation was a flagrant\r\nviolation of the \"immemorial rights of Englishmen.\" Now the colonists\r\nhad come to believe that their only true representatives were those for\r\nwhom they voted personally, the members of the provincial assemblies.\r\nEach colony had its representative assembly; and these assemblies, like\r\nthe parent Parliament in Great Britain, had become very important by\r\nacquiring the function of voting taxes. The colonists, therefore,\r\nclaimed that taxes could be voted only by their own assemblies, while\r\nthe British government replied, with some pertinency, that Parliament,\r\nalthough elected by a very small minority of the population, was\r\nconsidered to be generally representative of all British subjects.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Stamp Act Congress, 1765]\r\n\r\nMany colonists, less learned than the lawyers, were unacquainted with\r\nthe subtleties of the argument, but they were quite willing to be\r\npersuaded that in refusing to pay British taxes they were contending\r\nfor a great principle of liberty and self-government. Opposition to the\r\nstamp tax spread like wildfire and culminated in a congress at New York\r\nin October, 1765, comprising delegates from nine colonies. The \"Stamp\r\nAct Congress,\" for so it was called, issued a declaration of rights--\r\nthe rights of trial by jury [Footnote: The right of trial by jury had\r\nbeen violated by British officials in punishing smugglers.] and of\r\nself-taxation--and formally protested against the Stamp Act.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Repeal of the Stamp Act, 1776]\r\n\r\nParliament might have disregarded the declaration of the Congress, but\r\nnot the tidings of popular excitement, of mob violence, of stamp-\r\ncollectors burned in effigy. Moreover, colonial boycotts against\r\nBritish goods--\"nonimportation agreements\"--were effective in creating\r\nsentiment in England in favor of conciliation. Taking advantage of\r\nGrenville's resignation, a new ministry under the marquess of\r\nRockingham, [Footnote: Rockingham retired in July, 1766] a liberal\r\nWhig, procured the repeal of the obnoxious Stamp Act in March, 1766.\r\nWhile the particular tax was abandoned, a Declaratory Act was issued,\r\naffirming the constitutional right of Parliament to bind the colonies\r\nin all cases.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Townshend Acts, 1767]\r\n\r\nThat right was asserted again in 1767 by a brilliant but reckless\r\nchancellor of the exchequer, Charles Townshend, who, without the\r\nconsent of the other ministers, put through Parliament the series of\r\nacts which bear his name. His intention was to raise a regular colonial\r\nrevenue for the support of colonial governors, judges, and other\r\nofficers as well as for the defense of the colonies. For these\r\npurposes, import duties were laid on glass, lead, painters' colors,\r\npaper, and tea; the duties were to be collected by English\r\ncommissioners resident in the American ports; and infractions of the\r\nlaw in America were to be tried in courts without juries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The Boston Massacre\"]\r\n\r\nThe Townshend Acts brought forth immediate and indignant protests.\r\nColonial merchants renewed and extended their nonimportation\r\nagreements. Within a year the imports Boston from Great Britain fell\r\noff by more than £700,000. The customs officers were unable or afraid\r\nto collect the duties strictly, and it is said that in three years the\r\ntotal revenue from them amounted only to £16,000. Troops were\r\ndispatched to overawe Boston, but the angry Bostonians hooted and\r\nhissed the \"lobsterbacks,\" as the redcoats were derisively styled, and\r\nin 1770 provoked them to actual bloodshed--the so-called \"Boston\r\nMassacre.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord North, Prime Minister, 1770]\r\n\r\nAt this crucial moment, King George III chose a new prime minister,\r\nLord North, a gentleman of wit, ability, and affability, unfailingly\r\nhumorous, and unswervingly faithful to the king. Among his first\r\nmeasures was the repeal (1770) of the hated Townshend duties. Merely a\r\ntax of threepence a pound on tea was retained, in order that the\r\ncolonies might not think that Parliament had surrendered its right to\r\ntax them. Lord North even made an arrangement with the East India\r\nCompany whereby tea was sold so cheaply that it would not pay to\r\nsmuggle tea from the Dutch.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The Boston Tea Party,\" 1773]\r\n\r\nBut the colonists would not now yield even the principle of\r\nParliamentary taxation. [Footnote: Despite the fact that the colonists\r\nhad regularly been paying import duties on molasses and on foreign\r\nwine.] They insisted that were they to pay this tax, trifling as it\r\nmight be, Parliament would assert that they had acknowledged its right\r\nto tax them, and would soon lay heavier taxes upon them. They,\r\ntherefore, refused to buy the tea, and on a cold December night in 1773\r\na number of Boston citizens dressed up like Indians, boarded a British\r\ntea ship, and emptied 342 chests of tea into the harbor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Five \"Intolerable Acts,\" 1774]\r\n\r\nBoston's \"Tea-Party\" brought punishment swift and sure in the famous\r\nfive \"intolerable acts\" (1774). Boston harbor was closed; Massachusetts\r\nwas practically deprived of self-government; royal officers who\r\ncommitted capital offenses were to be tried in England or in other\r\ncolonies; royal troops were quartered on the colonists; and the\r\nprovince of Quebec was extended south to the Ohio, cutting off vast\r\nterritories claimed by Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia. This\r\nlast act, by recognizing and establishing the Roman Catholic Church in\r\nFrench-speaking Quebec, excited the liveliest fear and apprehension on\r\nthe part of Protestants in the English-speaking colonies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First Continental Congress, 1774]\r\n\r\nAgitators in the other colonies feared that their turn would come next,\r\nand rallied to the aid of Massachusetts. The first Continental Congress\r\nof delegations from all the colonies [Footnote: Except Georgia.] met in\r\n1774 in Philadelphia \"to deliberate and determine upon wise and proper\r\nmeasures, to be by them recommended to all the colonies, for the\r\nrecovery and establishment of their just rights and liberties, civil\r\nand religious, and the restoration of union and harmony between Great\r\nBritain and the colonies.\" The Congress dispatched a petition to the\r\nking and urged the colonists to be faithful to the \"American\r\nAssociation\" for the non-importation of British goods.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WAR OF AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE, 1775-1783\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolt of the Thirteen Colonies]\r\n\r\nNeither king nor colonies would yield a single point. William Pitt, now\r\nearl of Chatham, in vain proposed conciliatory measures. The colonies\r\nfast drifted into actual revolt. In May, 1775, the second Continental\r\nCongress met at Philadelphia, but already blood had been shed at\r\nLexington (Massachusetts), 19 April, 1775, and New England was a hotbed\r\nof rebellion. The Congress accepted facts as they were, declared war,\r\nappointed George Washington commander-in-chief, sent agents to France\r\nand other foreign countries, and addressed a final petition to the\r\nking.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Declaration of Independence, 1776]\r\n\r\nBut it was too late for reconciliation, and events marched rapidly\r\nuntil on 4 July, 1776, the colonies declared themselves \"free and\r\nindependent states.\" [Footnote: The colonies on the recommendation of\r\nCongress set up independent governments and these state governments\r\nwere formally federated in accordance with \"articles of Confederation\r\nand perpetual Union,\" drawn up in Congress in 1777 and finally ratified\r\nin 1781.] The Declaration of Independence was remarkable for two\r\nthings, its philosophy and its effects. The philosophy was that held by\r\nmany radical thinkers of the time--\"that all men are endowed by their\r\nCreator with certain unalienable rights\"; that among such rights are\r\nlife, liberty, and the exclusive right to tax themselves; and that any\r\npeople may rightfully depose a tyrannical ruler. We shall find a\r\nsimilar philosophy applied more boldly in the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nIn America the Declaration was denounced by \"Tories\" as treason, but\r\nwas welcomed by \"patriots\" as an inspiration and a stimulus. To show\r\ntheir joy, the people of New York City pulled down the leaden statue of\r\nKing George and molded it into bullets. Instead of rebellious subjects,\r\nthe English-speaking Americans now claimed to be a belligerent nation,\r\nand on the basis of this claim they sought recognition and aid from\r\nother nations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difficulties and Early Successes of the British]\r\n\r\nFor over three years, however, the war was carried on simply between\r\nrebellious colonies and the mother country. Had the grave nature of the\r\nrevolt been thoroughly understood in England from the outset, the\r\ncolonists might possibly have been crushed within a short time, for\r\nmany of the richest colonists were opposed to the war; and even had the\r\n\"people of the United States\" supported the struggle unanimously, they\r\nwere no match for Great Britain in wealth, population, or naval power.\r\nAs it was, Great Britain allowed the revolution to get under full\r\nheadway before making a serious effort to suppress it. In 1776,\r\nhowever, a force of about 30,000 men, many of whom were mercenary\r\nGerman soldiers, commonly called \"Hessians,\" was sent to occupy New\r\nYork. Thenceforward, the British pursued aggressive tactics, and\r\ninasmuch as their armies were generally superior to those of the\r\ncolonists in numbers, discipline, and equipment, and besides were\r\nsupported by powerful fleets, they were able to possess themselves of\r\nthe important colonial ports of New York, Philadelphia, and\r\nCharlestown, [Footnote: Name changed to Charleston in 1783.] and to win\r\nmany victories. On the other hand, the region to be conquered was\r\nextensive and the rebel armies stubborn and elusive. Moreover, the\r\ncolonists possessed a skillful leader in the person of the aristocratic\r\nVirginian planter who has already been mentioned as taking a part in\r\nthe French and Indian War. At first, George Washington was criticized\r\nfor bringing the gravity of a judge and the dignified bearing of a\r\ncourtier to the battlefield, but he soon proved his ability. He was\r\nwise enough to retreat before superior forces, always keeping just out\r\nof harm's way, and occasionally catching his incautious pursuer\r\nunawares, as at Princeton or Trenton.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British Reverse at Saratoga, 1777]\r\n\r\nOne of the crucial events of the war was the surrender of the British\r\nGeneral Burgoyne with some six thousand men at Saratoga, on 17 October,\r\n1777, after an unsuccessful invasion of northern New York. At that very\r\ntime, Benjamin Franklin, the public-spirited Philadelphia publisher,\r\nwas in Paris attempting to persuade France to ally herself with the\r\nUnited States. Franklin's charming personality, his \"republican\r\nplainness,\" his shrewd common sense, as well as his knowledge of\r\nphilosophy and science, made him welcome at the brilliant French court;\r\nbut France, although still smarting under the humiliating treaty of\r\n1763, would not yield to his persuasion until the American victory at\r\nSaratoga seemed to indicate that the time had come to strike. An\r\nalliance with the United States was concluded, and in 1778 war was\r\ndeclared against Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Entrance into the War of France (1778), Spain (1779),\r\nHolland (1780)]\r\n[Sidenote: Isolation of Great Britain]\r\n\r\nThe war now took on a larger aspect, and in its scale of operations and\r\nin its immediate significance the fighting in the colonies was dwarfed\r\ninto comparative insignificance. In the attack upon Great Britain,\r\nFrance was dutifully joined by Spain (1779). Holland, indignant at the\r\nway in which Great Britain had tried to exclude Dutch traders from\r\ncommerce with America, joined the Bourbons (1780) against their common\r\nfoe. Other nations, too, had become alarmed at the rapid growth and\r\ndomineering maritime policy of Great Britain. Since the outbreak of\r\nhostilities, British captains and admirals had claimed the right to\r\nsearch and seize neutral vessels trading with America or bearing\r\ncontraband of war. Against this dangerous practice, Catherine II of\r\nRussia protested vigorously, and in 1780 formed the \"armed neutrality\r\nof the North\" with Sweden and Denmark to uphold the protest with force,\r\nif necessary. Prussia, Portugal, the Two Sicilies, and the Holy Roman\r\nEmpire subsequently pronounced their adherence to the Armed Neutrality,\r\nand Great Britain was confronted by a unanimously hostile Europe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The War in Europe]\r\n\r\nIn the actual operations only three nations figured--France, Spain, and\r\nHolland; and of the three the last named gave little trouble except in\r\nthe North Sea. More to be feared were France and Spain, for by them the\r\nBritish Empire was attacked in all its parts. For a while in 1779 even\r\nthe home country was threatened by a Franco-Spanish fleet of sixty-six\r\nsail, convoying an army of 60,000 men; but the plan came to naught.\r\nPowerful Spanish and French forces, launched against Great Britain's\r\nMediterranean possessions, succeeded in taking Minorca, but were\r\nrepulsed by the British garrison of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The War in America]\r\n\r\nOn the continent of North America the insurgent colonists, aided by\r\nFrench fleets and French soldiers, gained a signal victory. An American\r\nand French army under Washington and Lafayette and a French fleet under\r\nDe Grasse suddenly closed in upon the British general, Lord Cornwallis,\r\nin Yorktown, Virginia, and compelled him to surrender on 19 October,\r\n1781, with over 7000 men. The capitulation of Cornwallis practically\r\ndecided the struggle in America, for all the reserve forces of Great\r\nBritain were required in Europe, in the West Indies, and in Asia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The War in the West Indies]\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Saints, 1782]\r\n\r\nMatters were going badly for Great Britain until a naval victory in the\r\nCaribbean Sea partially redeemed the day. For three winters an\r\nindecisive war had been carried on in the West Indies, but in 1782\r\nthirty-six British ships, under the gallant Rodney, met the French\r\nCount de Grasse with thirty-three sail of the line near the group of\r\nislands known as \"the Saints,\" and a great battle ensued--the \"battle\r\nof Saints\"--on 12 April, 1782. During the fight the wind suddenly\r\nveered around, making a great gap in the line of French ships, and into\r\nthis gap sailed the British admiral, breaking up the French fleet, and,\r\nin the confusion, capturing six vessels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The War in India]\r\n\r\nWhile the battle of Saints saved the British power in the West Indies,\r\nthe outlook in the East became less favorable. At first the British had\r\nbeen successful in seizing the French forts in India (1778) and in\r\ndefeating (1781) the native ally of the French, Hyder Ali, the sultan\r\nof Mysore. But in 1782 the tide was turned by the appearance of the\r\nFrench admiral De Suffren, whose brilliant victories over a superior\r\nBritish fleet gave the French temporary control of the Bay of Bengal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defeat but not Ruin of Great Britain]\r\n[Sidenote: Treaties of Paris and Versailles, 1783]\r\n\r\nUnsuccessful in America, inglorious in India, expelled from Minorca,\r\nunable to control Ireland, [Footnote: The Protestants in Ireland had\r\narmed and organized volunteer forces, and threatened rebellion unless\r\nGreat Britain granted \"home rule\" to them. Great Britain yielded and in\r\n1782 granted legislative autonomy to the Irish Parliament. See below,\r\np. 431.] and weary with war, England was very ready for peace, but not\r\nentirely humbled, for was she not still secure in the British Channel,\r\nvictorious over the Dutch, triumphant in the Caribbean, unshaken in\r\nIndia, and unmoved on Gibraltar? Defeat, but not humiliation, was the\r\nkeynote of the treaties (1783) which Great Britain concluded, one at\r\nParis with the United States, and one at Versailles with France and\r\nSpain. Let us consider the provisions of these treaties in order, as\r\nthey affected the United States, France, and Spain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The United States of America]\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of Paris (3 September, 1783), the former thirteen\r\ncolonies were recognized as the sovereign and independent United States\r\nof America,--bounded on the north by Canada and the Great Lakes, on the\r\neast by the Atlantic, on the west by the Mississippi, and on the south\r\nby Florida. Important fishing rights on the Newfoundland Banks and the\r\nprivilege of navigation on the Mississippi were extended to the new\r\nnation. When the treaty of Paris was signed, the United States were\r\nstill held loosely together by the articles of Confederation, but after\r\nseveral years of political confusion, a new and stronger federal\r\nconstitution was drawn up in 1787, and in 1789 George Washington became\r\nfirst president of the republic. The republic thus created was the\r\nfirst important embodiment of the political theories of Montesquieu and\r\nother French philosophers, who, while condemning titled nobility and\r\nabsolute monarchy, distrusted the ignorant classes of the people, and\r\nbelieved in placing political control chiefly in the hands of\r\nintelligent men of property and position.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Results to France]\r\n\r\nHad it not been for the disastrous battle of Saints, France might have\r\ndictated very favorable terms in the treaty of Versailles, [Footnote:\r\nIn 1786 a supplementary Anglo-French treaty restored regular commerce\r\nbetween the two nations, and recognized that Great Britain had no right\r\nto seize traders flying a neutral flag, except for contraband of war,\r\n_i.e._, guns, powder, and provisions of war.] but, as it was, she\r\nmerely regained Tobago in the West Indies and Senegal in Africa, which\r\nshe had lost in 1763. [Footnote: See above, p. 317.] The equipment of\r\nnavies and armies had exhausted the finances of the French government,\r\nand was largely responsible for the bankruptcy which was soon to\r\noccasion the fall of absolutism in France. Moreover, French \"radicals,\"\r\nhaving seen the Americans revolt against a king, were, themselves, the\r\nmore ready to enter upon a revolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Results to Spain]\r\n\r\nBetter than France fared Spain. By the treaty of Versailles she\r\nreceived the island of Minorca and the territory of Florida, which then\r\nincluded the southern portions of what later became the American states\r\nof Alabama and Mississippi. [Footnote: The Louisiana territory, which\r\nhad come into Spanish possession in 1763, was re-ceded to France in\r\n1800 and sold by France to the United States in 1803. Eighteen years\r\nlater (1821) all of Florida was formally transferred to the United\r\nStates. And see below, p. 532.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Settlement between Great Britain and Holland, 1784]\r\n\r\nHolland, the least important participant in the war, was not a party to\r\nthe treaty of Versailles, but was left to conclude a separate peace\r\nwith Great Britain in the following year (1784). The Dutch not only\r\nlost some of their East Indian possessions, [Footnote: Including\r\nstations on the Malabar and Coromandel coasts of India.]  but, what was\r\nmore essential, they were forced to throw open to British merchants the\r\nvaluable trade of the Malay Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REFORMATION OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New Conciliatory Colonial Policy]\r\n\r\nThe War of American Independence not only had cost Great Britain the\r\nthirteen colonies, hitherto the most important, [Footnote: The thirteen\r\ncolonies were not actually then so profitable, however, as the fertile\r\nWest Indies, nor did they fit in so well with the mercantilist theory\r\nof Colonialism.] oldest, and strongest of her possessions, and likewise\r\nSenegal, Florida, Tobago, and Minorca, but it had necessitated a\r\nterrible expenditure of men, money, and ships. More bitter than the\r\ndisastrous results of the war, however, was the reflection that\r\npossibly all might have been avoided by a policy of conciliation and\r\nconcession. Still it was not too late to learn, and in its treatment of\r\nthe remaining colonies, the British government showed that the lesson\r\nhad not been lost.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Quebec Act, 1774]\r\n[Sidenote: Board of Control in India, 1784]\r\n[Sidenote: Separate Parliament for Ireland, 1782]\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the revolt of the English-speaking colonies in America, a\r\nwise measure of toleration was accorded to the French inhabitants of\r\nCanada by the Quebec Act of 1774, which allowed them freely to profess\r\ntheir Roman Catholic religion, and to enjoy the continuance of the\r\nFrench civil law. To these advantages was added in 1791 the privilege\r\nof a representative assembly. India, too, felt the influence of the new\r\npolicy, when in 1784 Parliament created a Board of Control to see that\r\nthe East India Company did not abuse its political functions. Even\r\nIreland, which was practically a colony, was accorded in 1782 the right\r\nto make its own local laws, a measure of self-government enjoyed till 1\r\nJanuary, 1801. [Footnote: See below, p. 431.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decline and Gradual Abandonment of Mercantilism]\r\n\r\nBritish commercial policy, too, underwent a change, for the Navigation\r\nActs, which had angered the American colonies, could not now be applied\r\nto the free nation of the United States. Moreover, the mercantilist\r\ntheory, having in this case produced such unfortunate results,\r\nhenceforth began to lose ground, and it is not without interest that\r\nAdam Smith's _Wealth of Nations_, the classic expression of the\r\nnew political economy of free trade,--of _laisser-faire_, as the\r\nFrench styled it,--which was destined to supplant mercantilism, was\r\npublished in 1776, the very year of the declaration of American\r\nindependence. Of course Great Britain's mercantilist trade regulations\r\nwere not at once abandoned, but they had received a death-blow, and\r\nBritish commerce seemed none the worse for it. The southern American\r\nstates began to grow cotton [Footnote: During the war, cotton was\r\nintroduced into Georgia and Carolina from the Bahamas, and soon became\r\nan important product. In 1794, 1,600,000 pounds were shipped to Great\r\nBritain.] for the busy looms of British manufacturers, and of their own\r\nfree will the citizens of the United States bought the British\r\nmanufactures which previously they had boycotted as aggrieved\r\ncolonists. In this particular, at least, the loss of the colonies was\r\nhardly a loss at all.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extent of the British Empire at Close of Eighteenth Century]\r\n\r\nEven for those ardent British patriots who wished to see their flag\r\nwaving over half the world and who were deeply chagrined by the\r\nuntoward political schism that had rent kindred English-speaking\r\npeoples asunder, there was still some consolation and there was about\r\nto be some compensation. In the New World, Canada, Bermuda, the\r\nBahamas, Jamaica, and smaller islands of the West Indies, and a part of\r\nHonduras, made no mean empire; and in the Old World the British flag\r\nflew over the forts at Gibraltar, Gambia, and the Gold Coast, while\r\nIndia offered almost limitless scope for ambition and even for greed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extension of the British Empire in India]\r\n[Sidenote: Warren Hastings]\r\n\r\nTo the extension and solidification of her empire in the East, Great\r\nBritain now devoted herself, and with encouraging results. It will be\r\nremembered that British predominance in India had already been assured\r\nby the brilliant and daring Clive, who had defeated the French, set up\r\na puppet nawab in Bengal, and attempted to eliminate corruption from\r\nthe administration, Clive's work was continued by a man no less famous,\r\nWarren Hastings (1732-1818), whose term as governor-general of India\r\n(1774-1785) covered the whole period of the American revolt. At the age\r\nof seven-teen, Hastings had first entered the employ of the British\r\nEast India Company, and an apprenticeship of over twenty years in India\r\nhad browned his face and inured his lean body to the peculiarities of\r\nthe climate, as well as giving him a thorough insight into the native\r\ncharacter. When at last, in 1774, he became head of the Indian\r\nadministration, Hastings inaugurated a policy which he pursued with\r\ntireless attention to details--a policy involving the transference of\r\nBritish headquarters to Calcutta, and a thorough reform of the police,\r\nmilitary, and financial systems. In his wars and intrigues with native\r\nprinces and in many of his financial transactions, a Parliament, which\r\nwas inclined to censure, found occasion to attack his honor, and the\r\nfamous Edmund Burke, with all the force of oratory and hatred,\r\nattempted to convict the great governor of \"high crimes and\r\nmisdemeanors.\" But the tirades of Burke were powerless against the man\r\nwho had so potently strengthened the foundations of the British empire\r\nin India.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cornwallis]\r\n\r\nIn 1785 Hastings was succeeded by Lord Cornwallis--the same who had\r\nsurrendered to Washington at Yorktown. Cornwallis was as successful in\r\nIndia as he had been unfortunate in America. His organization of the\r\ntax system proved him a wise administrator, and his reputation as a\r\ngeneral was enhanced by the defeat of the rebellious sultan of Mysore.\r\n\r\nThe work begun so well by Clive, Hastings, and Cornwallis, was ably\r\ncarried on by subsequent administrators, [Footnote: For details\r\nconcerning British rule in India between 1785 and 1858, see Vol. II,\r\npp. 662 ff.] until in 1858 the crown finally took over the empire of\r\nthe East India Company, an empire stretching northward to the\r\nHimalayas, westward to the Indus River, and eastward to the\r\nBrahmaputra.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Straits Settlements]\r\n[Sidenote: Australia]\r\n\r\nIn the years immediately following the War of American Independence\r\noccurred two other important extensions of British power. One was the\r\noccupation of the \"Straits Settlements\" which gave Great Britain\r\ncontrol of the Malay peninsula and of the Straits of Malacca through\r\nwhich the spice ships passed. But more valuable as a future home for\r\nEnglish-speaking Europeans, and, therefore, as partial compensation for\r\nthe loss of the United States, was the vast island-continent of\r\nAustralia, which had been almost unknown until the famous voyage of\r\nCaptain Cook to Botany Bay in 1770. For many years Great Britain\r\nregarded Australia as a kind of open-air prison for her criminals, and\r\nthe first British settlers at Port Jackson (1788) were exiled convicts.\r\nThe introduction of sheep-raising and the discovery of gold made the\r\nisland a more attractive home for colonists, and thenceforth its\r\ndevelopment was rapid. To-day, with an area of almost 3,000,000 square\r\nmiles, and a population of some 4,800,000 English-speaking people,\r\nAustralia is a commonwealth more populous than and three times as large\r\nas were the thirteen colonies with which Great Britain so unwillingly\r\nparted in 1783.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL READING\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH COLONIAL POLICY.

[Footnote: See above, pp. 10\r\nff.] Outwardly, little change was observable in the eighteenth. The\r\nHoly Roman Empire still existed as a nominal bond of union for a loose\r\nassemblage of varied states. There was still a Habsburg emperor. There\r\nwere still electors--the number had been increased from seven to nine\r\n[Footnote: Bavaria became an electorate in 1623 and Hanover in 1708; in\r\n1778 Bavaria and the Palatinate were joined, again making eight.]--with\r\nsome influence and considerable honor. There was still a Diet, composed\r\nof representatives of the princes and of the free cities, meeting\r\nregularly at Ratisbon. [Footnote: Ratisbon or Regensburg--in the\r\nBavarian Palatinate. The Diet met there regularly after 1663.] But the\r\nempire was clearly in decline. The wave of national enthusiasm which\r\nMartin Luther evoked had spent itself in religious wrangling and\r\ndissension, and in the inglorious conflicts of the Thirty Years' War.\r\nThe Germans had become so many pawns that might be moved back and forth\r\nupon the international chessboard by Habsburg and Bourbon gamesters.\r\nSwitzerland had been lost to the empire; both France and Sweden had\r\ndeliberately dismembered other valuable districts. [Footnote: For the\r\nprovisions of the treaties of Westphalia, see above, pp. 228 f.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Deplorable Results of the Thirty Years' War]\r\n\r\nIt seemed as though slight foundation remained on which a substantial\r\npolitical structure could be reared, for the social conditions in the\r\nGermanies were deplorable. It is not an exaggeration to say that during\r\nthe Thirty Years' War Germany lost at least half of its population and\r\nmore than two-thirds of its movable property. In the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century, at about the time Louis XIV succeeded to a fairly\r\nprosperous France, German towns and villages were in ashes, and vast\r\ndistricts turned into deserts. Churches and schools were closed by\r\nhundreds, and religious and intellectual torpor prevailed. Industry and\r\ntrade were so completely paralyzed that by 1635 the Hanseatic League\r\nwas virtually abandoned, because the free commercial cities, formerly\r\nso wealthy, could not meet the necessary expenses. Economic expansion\r\nand colonial enterprise, together with the consequent upbuilding of a\r\nwell-to-do middle class, were resigned to Spain, Portugal, Holland,\r\nFrance, or England, without a protest from what had once been a proud\r\nburgher class in Germany. This elimination of an influential\r\nbourgeoisie was accompanied by a sorry impoverishment and oppression of\r\nthe peasantry. These native sons of the German soil had fondly hoped\r\nfor better things from the religious revolution and agrarian\r\ninsurrections of the sixteenth century; but they were doomed to failure\r\nand disappointment. The peasantry were in a worse plight in the\r\neighteenth century in Germany than in any other country of western or\r\ncentral Europe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The German Princes]\r\n\r\nThe princes alone knew how to profit by the national prostration.\r\nEnriched by the confiscation of ecclesiastical property in the\r\nsixteenth century and relieved of meddlesome interference on the part\r\nof the emperor or the Diet, they utilized the decline of the middle\r\nclass and the dismal serfdom of the peasantry to exalt their personal\r\npolitical power. They got rid of the local assemblies or greatly\r\ncurtailed their privileges, and gradually established petty tyrannies.\r\nAfter the Thirty Years' War, it became fashionable for the heirs of\r\nGerman principalities to travel and especially to spend some time at\r\nthe court of France. Here they imbibed the political ideas of the Grand\r\nMonarch, and in a short time nearly every petty court in the Germanics\r\nwas a small-sized reproduction of the court of Versailles. In a silly\r\nand ridiculous way the princes aped their great French neighbor: they\r\ntoo maintained armies, palaces, and swarms of household officials,\r\nwhich, though a crushing burden upon the people, were yet so\r\ninsignificant in comparison with the real pomp of France, that they\r\nwere in many instances the laughingstock of Europe. Beneath an external\r\ngloss of refinement, these princes were, as a class, coarse and\r\nselfish, and devoid of any compensating virtues. Neither the common\r\npeople, whom they had impoverished, nor the Church, which they had\r\nrobbed, was now strong enough to resist the growing absolutism and\r\nselfishness of the princes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HABSBURG DOMINIONS\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles VI and his Hereditary Dominions]\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the eighteenth century, the largest and most\r\nimportant states of the Holy Roman Empire were those which owned the\r\ndirect sovereignty of the Austrian Habsburgs. Charles VI (1711-1740),\r\nwho as the Archduke Charles had vainly struggled against Louis XIV to\r\nsecure the whole Spanish inheritance in the War of the Spanish\r\nSuccession (1702-1713), reigned over extensive and scattered dominions.\r\nAround Vienna, his capital city, were gathered his hereditary\r\npossessions: (1) Lower Austria, or Austria proper, on the Danube; (2)\r\nInner Austria, which comprised Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola; (3)\r\nFurther Austria, consisting of the mountainous regions about Innsbruck,\r\ncommonly designated the Tyrol; and (4) Upper Austria, embracing\r\nBreisgau on the upper Rhine near the Black Forest. To this nucleus of\r\nlands, in the greater part of which the German language was spoken\r\nuniversally, had been added in course of time the Czech or Slavic\r\nkingdom of Bohemia with its German dependency of Silesia and its Slavic\r\ndependency of Moravia, and a portion of the Magyar kingdom of Hungary,\r\nwith its Slavic dependencies of Croatia and Slavonia and its Rumanian\r\ndependency of Transylvania. Charles VI, like so many of his Habsburg\r\nancestors, was also emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and was thereby\r\naccounted the foremost of German princes. But neither Bohemia nor\r\nHungary was predominantly German in language or feeling, and Hungary\r\nwas not even a part of the Holy Roman Empire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conquests of Charles VI]\r\n\r\nWhat additions were made to the Habsburg dominions by Charles VI were\r\nall of non-German peoples. The treaty of Utrecht had given him the\r\nFlemish- and French-speaking Belgian Netherlands and the Italian-\r\nspeaking duchy of Milan and kingdom of the Two Sicilies. [Footnote: See\r\nabove, p. 253, footnote.] A series of wars with the Ottoman Turks had\r\nenabled his family to press the Hungarian boundaries south as far as\r\nBosnia and Serbia and to incorporate as a dependency of Hungary the\r\nRumanian-speaking principality of Transylvania. [Footnote: Definitely\r\nceded by Turkey by the treaty of Karlowitz (1699).] Of course all these\r\nnewer states of the Habsburgs remained outside of the Holy Roman\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diversity of Habsburg Dominions]\r\n\r\nBetween the various peoples who were thus brought under the Habsburg\r\nsway, the bond was of loosest description. They spoke a dozen different\r\nlanguages and presented an even greater diversity of interests. They\r\ndid not constitute a compact, strongly centralized, national state like\r\nFrance. Charles VI ruled his territories by manifold titles: he was\r\narchduke of Austria, king of Bohemia, king of Hungary, duke of Milan,\r\nand prince of the Netherlands; and the administration of each of these\r\nfive major groups was independent of the others. The single bond of\r\nunion was the common allegiance to the Habsburg monarch.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Check upon Habsburg Ambitions in the Germanies]\r\n\r\nTo adopt and pursue a policy which would suit all these lands and\r\npeoples would hardly be possible for any mortal: it certainly surpassed\r\nthe wit of the Habsburgs. They had made an attempt in the seventeenth\r\ncentury to develop a vigorous German policy, to unify the empire and to\r\nstrengthen their hold upon it, but they had failed dismally. The\r\ndisasters of the Thirty Years' War, the jealousies and ambitions of the\r\nother German princes, the interested intervention of foreign powers,\r\nnotably Sweden and France, made it brutally clear that Habsburg\r\ninfluence in the Germanies had already reached its highest pitch and\r\nthat henceforth it would tend gradually to wane.\r\n\r\nBlocked in the Germanies, the Austrian Habsburgs looked elsewhere to\r\nsatisfy their aspirations. But almost equal difficulties confronted\r\nthem. Extension to the southeast in the direction of the Balkan\r\npeninsula involved almost incessant warfare with the Turks. Increase of\r\nterritory in Italy incited Spain, France, and Sardinia to armed\r\nresistance. Development of the trade of the Belgian Netherlands aroused\r\nthe hostility of the influential commercial classes in England,\r\nHolland, and France. The time and toil spent upon these non-German\r\nprojects obviously could not be devoted to the internal affairs of the\r\nHoly Roman Empire. Thus, not only were the Germanies a source of\r\nweakness to the Habsburgs, but the Habsburgs were a source of weakness\r\nto the Germanies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Continued Prestige of the Habsburgs]\r\n\r\nDespite these drawbacks, the Habsburg family was still powerful. The\r\nnatural resources and native wealth of many of the regions, the large,\r\nif rather cosmopolitan, armies which might be raised, the intricate\r\nmarriage relationships with most of the sovereign families of Europe,\r\nthe championship of the Catholic Church, the absolutist principles and\r\npractices of the reigning prince, all contributed to cloak the\r\nweaknesses, under a proud name and pretentious fame, of the imperial\r\nAustrian line.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Question of the Habsburg Inheritance]\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Pragmatic Sanction\" of Charles VI]\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century a particularly unkind fate seemed to attend\r\nthe Habsburgs. We have already noticed how the extinction of the male\r\nline in the Spanish branch precipitated a great international war of\r\nsuccession, with the result that the Spanish inheritance was divided\r\nand the greater part passed to the rival Bourbon family. Now Charles VI\r\nwas obliged to face a similar danger in the Austrian inheritance. He\r\nhimself had neither sons nor brothers, but only a daughter, Maria\r\nTheresa. Spurred on by the fate of his Spanish kinsman, Charles VI\r\ndirected his energies toward securing a settlement of his possessions\r\nprior to his death. Early in his reign he promulgated a so-called\r\nPragmatic Sanction which declared that the Habsburg dominions were\r\nindivisible and that, contrary to long custom, they might be inherited\r\nby female heirs in default of male. Then he subordinated his whole\r\nforeign policy to securing general European recognition of the right of\r\nMaria Theresa to succeed to all his territories. One after another of\r\nhis manifold principalities swore to observe the Pragmatic Sanction.\r\nOne after another of the foreign powers--Prussia, Russia, Great\r\nBritain, Holland, the Empire, Poland, France, Spain, and Sardinia,--to\r\nwhom liberal concessions were made--pledged their word and their honor\r\nmost sacredly to preserve the Pragmatic Sanction. When Charles VI died\r\nin 1740, he left his daughter a disorganized state, a bankrupt\r\ntreasury, and a small ill-disciplined army, but he bequeathed her an\r\nample number of parchment guarantees. The cynical Prussian king\r\nremarked that 200,000 fighting men would have been a more useful\r\nlegacy, and, as events proved, he was right.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF PRUSSIA. THE HOHENZOLLERNS\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Hohenzollern Family]\r\n\r\nNext to the Habsburgs, the most influential German family in the\r\neighteenth century was the Hohenzollern. As far back as the tenth\r\ncentury, a line of counts was ruling over a castle on the hill of\r\nZollern just north of what is now Switzerland. These counts slowly\r\nextended their lands and their power through the fortunes of feudal\r\nwarfare and by means of a kindly interest on the part of the Holy Roman\r\nEmperors, until at length, in the twelfth century, a representative of\r\nthe Hohenzollerns became by marriage burgrave of the important city of\r\nNuremberg.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Brandenburg]\r\n\r\nSo far the Hohenzollerns had been fortunate, but as yet they were no\r\nmore conspicuous than hundreds of petty potentates throughout the\r\nempire. It was not until they were invested by the Habsburg emperor\r\nwith the electorate of Brandenburg in 1415 that they became prominent.\r\nBrandenburg was a district of northern Germany, centering in the town\r\nof Berlin and lying along the Oder River. As a mark, or frontier\r\nprovince, it was the northern and eastern outpost of the German\r\nlanguage and German culture, and the exigencies of almost perpetual\r\nwarfare with the neighboring Slavic peoples had given Brandenburg a\r\ngood deal of military experience and prestige. As an electorate,\r\nmoreover, it possessed considerable influence in the internal affairs\r\nof the Holy Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century, the acceptance of Lutheranism by the\r\nHohenzollern electors of Brandenburg enabled them, like many other\r\nprinces of northern Germany, to seize valuable properties of the\r\nCatholic Church and to rid themselves of a foreign power which had\r\ncurtailed their political and social sway. Brandenburg subsequently\r\nbecame the chief Protestant state of Germany, just as to Austria was\r\nconceded the leadership of the Catholic states.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Hohenzollerns and the Thirty Years' War]\r\n\r\nThe period of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) was as auspicious to\r\nthe Hohenzollerns as it was unlucky for the Habsburgs. On the eve of\r\nthe contest, propitious marriage alliances bestowed two important\r\nlegacies upon the family--the duchy of Cleves [Footnote: Though the\r\nalliance between Brandenburg and Cleves dated from 1614, the\r\nHohenzollerns did not reign over Cleves until 1666. With Cleves went\r\nits dependencies of Mark and Ravensberg.] on the lower Rhine, and the\r\nduchy of East Prussia, [Footnote: Prussia was then an almost purely\r\nSlavic state. It had been formed and governed from the thirteenth to\r\nthe sixteenth century by the Teutonic Knights, a military, crusading\r\norder of German Catholics, who aided in converting the Slavs to\r\nChristianity. In the sixteenth century the Grand Master of the Teutonic\r\nKnights professed the Lutheran faith and transformed Prussia into an\r\nhereditary duchy in his own family. In a series of wars West Prussia\r\nwas incorporated into Poland, while East Prussia became a fief of that\r\nkingdom. It was to East Prussia only that the Hohenzollern elector of\r\nBrandenburg succeeded in 1618.] on the Baltic north of Poland.\r\nHenceforth the head of the Hohenzollern family could sign himself\r\nmargrave and elector of Brandenburg, duke of Cleves, and duke of\r\nPrussia. In the last-named role, he was a vassal of the king of Poland;\r\nin the others, of the Holy Roman Emperor. In the course of the Thirty\r\nYears' War, the Hohenzollerns helped materially to lessen imperial\r\ncontrol, and at the close of the struggle secured the wealthy\r\nbishoprics of Halberstadt, Minden, and Magdeburg, [Footnote: The right\r\nof accession to Magdeburg was accorded the Hohenzollerns in 1648; they\r\ndid not formally possess it until 1680.] and the eastern half of the\r\nduchy of Pomerania.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Great Elector]\r\n\r\nThe international reputation of the Hohenzollerns was established by\r\nFrederick William, commonly styled the Great Elector (1640-1688). When\r\nhe ascended the throne, the Thirty Years' War had reduced his scattered\r\ndominions to utmost misery: he was resolved to restore prosperity, to\r\nunify his various possessions, and to make his realm a factor in\r\ngeneral European politics. By diplomacy more than by military prowess,\r\nhe obtained the new territories by the peace of Westphalia. Then,\r\ntaking advantage of a war between Sweden and Poland, he made himself so\r\ninvaluable to both sides, now helping one, now deserting to the other,\r\nthat by cunning and sometimes by unscrupulous intrigue, he induced the\r\nking of Poland to renounce suzerainty over East Prussia and to give him\r\nthat duchy in full sovereignty. In the Dutch War of Louis XIV (1672-\r\n1678) he completely defeated the Swedes, who were in alliance with\r\nFrance, and, although he was not allowed by the provisions of the peace\r\nto keep what he had conquered, nevertheless the fame of his army was\r\nestablished and Brandenburg-Prussia took rank as the chief competitor\r\nof Sweden's hegemony in the Baltic.\r\n\r\nIn matters of government, the Great Elector was, like his contemporary\r\nLouis XIV, a firm believer in absolutism. At the commencement of his\r\nreign, each one of the three parts of his lands--Brandenburg, Cleves,\r\nand East Prussia--was organized as a separate, petty state, with its\r\nown Diet or form of representative government, its own army, and its\r\nown independent administration. After a hard constitutional struggle,\r\nFrederick William deprived the several Diets of their significant\r\nfunctions, centered financial control in his own person, declared the\r\nlocal armies national, and merged the three separate administrations\r\ninto one, strictly subservient to his royal council at Berlin. Thus,\r\nthe three states were amalgamated into one; and, to all intents and\r\npurposes, they constituted a united monarchy.\r\n\r\nThe Great Elector was a tireless worker. He encouraged industry and\r\nagriculture, drained marshes, and built the Frederick William Canal,\r\njoining the Oder with the Elbe. When the revocation of the Edict of\r\nNantes caused so many Huguenots to leave France, the Great Elector's\r\nwarm invitation attracted to Brandenburg some 20,000, who were settled\r\naround Berlin and who gave French genius as well as French names to\r\ntheir adopted country. The capital city, which at the Great Elector's\r\naccession numbered barely 8000, counted at his death a population of\r\nover 20,000.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Brandenburg-Prussia a \"Kingdom,\" 1701]\r\n\r\nBrandenburg-Prussia was already an important monarchy, but its ruler\r\nwas not recognized as \"king\" until 1701, when the Emperor Leopold\r\nconferred upon him that title in order to enlist his support in the War\r\nof the Spanish Succession. In 1713, by the treaty of Utrecht, the other\r\nEuropean powers acknowledged the title. It was Prussia, rather than\r\nBrandenburg, which gave its name to the new kingdom, because the former\r\nwas an entirely independent state, while the latter was a member of the\r\nHoly Roman Empire. Thereafter the \"kingdom of Prussia\" [Footnote: At\r\nfirst the Hohenzollern monarch assumed the title of king _in_\r\nPrussia, because West Prussia was still a province of the kingdom of\r\nPoland. Gradually, however, under Frederick William I (1713-1740), the\r\npopular appellation of \"king of Prussia\" prevailed over the formal\r\n\"king in Prussia.\" West Prussia was definitely acquired in 1772 (see\r\nbelow, p. 387).] designated the combined territories of the\r\nHohenzollern family.\r\n\r\nPrussia rose rapidly in the eighteenth century. She shared with Austria\r\nthe leadership of the Germanies and secured a position in Europe as a\r\nfirst-rate power. This rise was the result largely of the efforts of\r\nFrederick William I (1713-1740).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: King Frederick William I, 1713-1740]\r\n\r\nKing Frederick William was a curious reversion to the type of his\r\ngrandfather: he was the Great Elector over again with all his practical\r\ngood sense if without his taste for diplomacy. His own ideal of\r\nkingship was a paternal despotism, and his ambition, to use most\r\nadvantageously the limited resources of his country in order to render\r\nPrussia feared and respected abroad. He felt that absolutism was the\r\nonly kind of government consonant with the character of his varied and\r\nscattered dominions, and he understood in a canny way the need of an\r\neffective army and of the closest economy which would permit a\r\nrelatively small kingdom to support a relatively large army. Under\r\nFrederick William I, money, military might, and divine-right monarchy\r\nbecame the indispensable props of the Hohenzollern rule in Prussia.\r\n\r\nBy a close thrift that often bordered on miserliness King Frederick\r\nWilliam I managed to increase his standing army from 38,000 to 80,000\r\nmen, bringing it up in numbers so as to rank with the regular armies of\r\nsuch first-rate states as France or Austria. In efficiency, it probably\r\nsurpassed the others. An iron discipline molded the Prussian troops\r\ninto the most precise military engine then to be found in Europe, and a\r\nstaff of officers, who were not allowed to buy their commissions, as in\r\nmany European states, but who were appointed on a merit basis,\r\ncommanded the army with truly professional skill and devoted loyalty.\r\n\r\nIn civil administration, the king persevered in the work of\r\ncentralizing the various departments. A \"general directory\" was\r\nintrusted with the businesslike conduct of the finances and gradually\r\nevolved an elaborate civil service--the famous Prussian bureaucracy,\r\nwhich, in spite of inevitable \"red tape,\" is notable to this day for\r\nits efficiency and devotion to duty. The king endeavored to encourage\r\nindustry and trade by enforcing up-to-date mercantilist regulations,\r\nand, although he repeatedly expressed contempt for current culture\r\nbecause of what he thought were its weakening tendencies, he\r\nnevertheless prescribed compulsory elementary education for his people.\r\n\r\nKing Frederick William, who did so much for Prussia, had many personal\r\neccentricities that highly amused Europe. Imbued with patriarchal\r\ninstincts, he had his eye on everybody and everything. He treated his\r\nkingdom as a schoolroom, and, like a zealous schoolmaster, flogged his\r\nnaughty subjects unmercifully. If he suspected a man of possessing\r\nadequate means, he might command him to erect a fine residence so as to\r\nimprove the appearance of the capital. If he met an idler in the\r\nstreets, he would belabor him with his cane and probably put him in the\r\narmy. And a funny craze for tall soldiers led to the creation of the\r\nfamous Potsdam Guard of Giants, a special company whose members must\r\nmeasure at least six feet in height, and for whose service he attracted\r\nmany foreigners by liberal financial offers: it was the only luxury\r\nwhich the parsimonious king allowed himself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Accession of Frederick the Great, 1740]\r\n\r\nDuring a portion of his reign the crabbed old king feared that all his\r\nlabors and savings would go for naught, for he was supremely\r\ndisappointed in his son, the crown-prince Frederick. The stern father\r\nhad no sympathy for the literary, musical, artistic tastes of his son,\r\nwhom he thought effeminate, and whom he abused roundly with a quick and\r\nviolent temper. When Prince Frederick tried to run away, the king\r\narrested him and for punishment put him through such an arduous, slave-\r\nlike training in the civil and military administration, from the lowest\r\ngrades upward, as perhaps no other royal personage ever received. It\r\nwas this despised and misunderstood prince who as Frederick II\r\nsucceeded his father on the throne of Prussia in 1740 and is known in\r\nhistory as Frederick the Great.\r\n\r\nThe year 1740 marked the accession of Frederick the Great in the\r\nHohenzollern possessions and of Maria Theresa in the Habsburg\r\nterritories. [Footnote: Below are discussed the foreign achievements\r\n(pp. 354 ff.) of these two rival sovereigns, and in Chapter XIV (pp.\r\n440 ff.) their internal policies.] It also marked the outbreak of a\r\nprotracted struggle within the Holy Roman Empire between the two\r\nforemost German states--Austria and Prussia.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MINOR GERMAN STATES\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: German States Other than Austria and Prussia]\r\n\r\nOf the three hundred other states which composed the empire, few were\r\nsufficiently large or important to exert any considerable influence on\r\nthe issue of the contest. A few, however, which took sides, deserve\r\nmention not only because in the eighteenth century they preserved a\r\nkind of balance of power between the rivals but also because they have\r\nbeen more or less conspicuous factors in the progress of recent times.\r\nSuch are Bavaria, Saxony, and Hanover.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bavaria]\r\n\r\nBavaria lay on the upper Danube to the west of Austria and in the\r\nextreme southeastern corner of what is now the German Empire. For\r\ncenturies it was ruled by the Wittelsbach family, whose remarkable\r\nprince, Maximilian I (1597-1651), had headed the Catholic League and\r\nloyally supported the Habsburgs in the Thirty Years' War, and by the\r\npeace of Westphalia had gained a part of the Palatinate [Footnote: The\r\nother part of the Palatinate, under another branch of the Wittelsbachs,\r\nwas reunited with Bavaria in 1779.] together with the title of\r\n\"elector.\" His successor had labored with much credit in the second\r\nhalf of the seventeenth century to repair the wounds caused by the war,\r\nencouraging agriculture and industries, building or restoring numerous\r\nchurches and monasteries. But the Bavarian electors in the first half\r\nof the eighteenth century sacrificed a sound, vigorous policy of\r\ninternal reform to a far-reaching ambition in international politics.\r\nDespite the bond of a common religion which united them to Austria,\r\nthey felt that their proximity to their powerful neighbor made the\r\nHabsburgs their natural enemies. In the War of the Spanish Succession,\r\ntherefore, Bavaria took the side of France against Austria, and when\r\nMaria Theresa ascended the throne in 1740, the elector of Bavaria, who\r\nhad married a Habsburg princess disbarred by the Pragmatic Sanction of\r\nCharles VI, immediately allied himself with Frederick of Prussia and\r\nwith France in order to dismember the Austrian dominions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Saxony]\r\n\r\nThe Saxony of the eighteenth century was but a very small fraction of\r\nthe vast Saxon duchy which once comprised all northwestern Germany and\r\nwhose people in early times had emigrated to England or had been\r\nsubjugated by Charlemagne. Saxony had been restricted since the\r\nthirteenth century to a district on the upper Elbe, wedged in between\r\nHabsburg Bohemia and Hohenzollern Brandenburg. Here, however, several\r\nelements combined to give it an importance far beyond its extent or\r\npopulation. It was the geographical center of the Germanies. It\r\noccupied a strategic position between Prussia and Austria. Its ruling\r\nfamily--the Wettins--were electors of the empire. It had been,\r\nmoreover, after the championship of Martin Luther by one of its most\r\nnotable electors, [footnote:  Frederick the Wise( 1486-1525)] a leader\r\nof the Lutheran cause, and the reformer's celebrated translation of the\r\nBible had fixed the Saxon dialect as the literary language of Germany.\r\nAt one time it seemed as if Saxony, rather than Brandenburg-Prussia,\r\nmight become the dominant state among the Germanies. But the trend of\r\nevents determined otherwise. A number of amiable but weak electors in\r\nthe seventeenth century repeatedly allied themselves with Austria\r\nagainst the Hohenzollerns and thereby practically conceded to\r\nBrandenburg the leadership of the Protestant states of northern\r\nGermany.[Footnote: Another source of weakness in Saxony was the custom\r\nin the Wettin family of dividing the inheritance among members of the\r\nfamily. Such was the origin of the present infinitesimal states of\r\nSaxe-Weimar, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Saxe-Meiningen, and Saxe-Altenburg.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Personal Union of Saxony and Poland]\r\n\r\nThen, too, toward the close of the century, the elector separated\r\nhimself from his people by becoming a Roman Catholic, and, in order\r\nthat he might establish himself as king of Poland, he burdened the\r\nstate with continued Austrian alliance, with war, and with heavy taxes.\r\nThe unnatural union of Saxony and Poland was maintained throughout the\r\ngreater part of the eighteenth century: it was singularly disastrous\r\nfor both parties.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hanover, and its Personal Union with Great Britain]\r\n\r\nA part of the original ancient territory of the Saxons in north western\r\nGermany was included in the eighteenth century in the state of Hanover,\r\nextending between the Elbe and the Weser and reaching from Brandenburg\r\ndown to the North Sea. Hanover was recognized as an electorate during\r\nthe War of the Spanish Succession, [Footnote: The emperor had given the\r\ntitle of elector to Ernest Augustus in 1692; the Powers recognized\r\nGeorge I as elector in 1708.] but its real importance rested on the\r\nfact that its first elector, through his mother's family, became in\r\n1714 George I of Great Britain, the founder of the Hanoverian dynasty\r\nin that country. This personal union between the British kingdom and\r\nthe electorate of Hanover continued for over a century, and was not\r\nwithout vital significance in international negotiations. Both George I\r\nand George II preferred Hanover to England as a place of residence and\r\ndirected their primary efforts towards the protection of their German\r\nlands from Habsburg or Hohenzollern encroachments.\r\n\r\nEnough has now been said to give some idea of the distracted condition\r\nof the Germanies in the eighteenth century and to explain why the Holy\r\nRoman Empire was an unimportant bond of union. Austria, traditionally\r\nthe chief of the Germanies, was increasingly absorbed in her non-German\r\npossessions in Hungary, Italy, and the Netherlands. Prussia, the rising\r\nkingdom of the North, comprised a population in which Slavs constituted\r\na large minority. Saxony was linked with Poland; Hanover, with Great\r\nBritain. Bavaria was a chronic ally of France. Add to this situation,\r\nthe political domination of France or Sweden over a number of the petty\r\nstates of the empire, the selfishness and jealousies of all the German\r\nrulers, the looming bitter rivalry between Prussia and Austria, and the\r\nsum-total is political chaos, bloodshed, and oppression.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE BETWEEN HOHENZOLLERNS AND HABSBURGS\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Frederick the Great and Maria Theresa]\r\n\r\nIn the struggle between Prussia and Austria--between Hohenzollerns and\r\nHabsburgs--centered the European diplomacy and wars of the mid-\r\neighteenth century. On one side was the young king Frederick II (1740-\r\n1786); on the other, the young queen Maria Theresa (1740-1780). Both\r\nhad ability and sincere devotion to their respective states and\r\npeoples,--a high sense of royal responsibilities. Maria Theresa was\r\nbeautiful, emotional, and proud; the Great Frederick was domineering,\r\ncynical, and always rational. The Austrian princess was a firm believer\r\nin Catholic Christianity; the Prussian king was a friend of Voltaire\r\nand a devotee of skepticism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Coalition against Maria Theresa]\r\n\r\nFrederick inherited from his father a fairly compact monarchy and a\r\nsplendidly trained and equipped army of 80,000 men. He smiled at the\r\ndisorganized troops, the disordered finances, the conflicting interests\r\nin the hodge-podge of territories which his rival had inherited from\r\nher father. He also smiled at the solemn promise which Prussia had made\r\nto respect the Austrian dominions. No sooner was the Emperor Charles VI\r\ndead and Maria Theresa proclaimed at Vienna than Frederick II entered\r\ninto engagements with Bavaria and France to dismember her realm. The\r\nelector of Bavaria was to be made Holy Roman Emperor as Charles VII and\r\nPrussia was to appropriate Silesia. France was suspected of designs\r\nupon the Austrian Netherlands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Frederick's Designs on Silesia]\r\n\r\nSilesia thus became the bone of contention between Frederick II and\r\nMaria Theresa. Silesia covered the fertile valley of the upper Oder,\r\nseparating the Slavic Czechs of Frederick's Bohemia on the west from\r\nthe Slavic Poles on the east. Its population, which was largely German,\r\nwas as numerous as that of the whole kingdom of Prussia, and if annexed\r\nto the Hohenzollern possessions would make them overwhelmingly German.\r\nOn the other hand, the loss of Silesia would give Austria less direct\r\ninfluence in strictly German affairs and would deprive her of a\r\nconvenient point of attack against Berlin and the heart of Prussia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Outbreak of the War of the Austrian Succession, 1740]\r\n\r\nTrumping up an ancient family claim to the duchy, Frederick immediately\r\nmarched his army into Silesia and occupied Breslau, its capital. To the\r\nwest, a combined Bavarian and French army prepared to invade Austria\r\nand Bohemia. Maria Theresa, pressed on all sides, fled to Hungary and\r\nbegged the Magyars to help her. The effect was electrical. Hungarians,\r\nAustrians, and Bohemians rallied to the support of the Habsburg throne;\r\nrecruits were drilled and hurried to the front; the War of the Austrian\r\nSuccession (1740-1748) was soon in full swing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Entrance of Great Britain and Spain]\r\n\r\nA trade war had broken out between Great Britain and Spain in 1739,\r\n[Footnote: Commonly called the War of Jenkins's Ear. See above, p. 311]\r\nwhich speedily became merged with the continental struggle. Great\r\nBritain was bent on maintaining liberal trading privileges in the\r\nBelgian Netherlands and always opposed the incorporation of those\r\nprovinces into the rival and powerful monarchy of France, preferring\r\nthat they should remain in the hands of some distant and less-feared,\r\nless commercial power, such as Austria. Great Britain, moreover, had\r\nfully recognized the Pragmatic Sanction and now determined that it was\r\nin accordance with her own best interests to supply Maria Theresa with\r\nmoney and to dispatch armies to the Continent to defend the Netherlands\r\nagainst France and to protect Hanover against Prussia. On the other\r\nside, the royal family of Spain sympathized with their Bourbon kinsmen\r\nin France and hoped to recover from Austria all the Italian possessions\r\nof which Spain had been deprived by the treaty of Utrecht (1713).\r\n\r\nThe main parties to the War of the Austrian Succession were, therefore,\r\non the one hand, Prussia, France, Spain, and Bavaria, and, on the\r\nother, Austria and Great Britain. With the former at first joined the\r\nelector of Saxony, who wished to play off Prussia against Austria for\r\nthe benefit of his Saxon and Polish lands, and the king of Sardinia,\r\nwho was ever balancing in Italy between Habsburg and Bourbon\r\npretensions. With Austria and Great Britain was united Holland, because\r\nof her desire to protect herself from possible French aggression.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Course of the War]\r\n\r\nThe war was not so terrible or bloody as its duration and the number of\r\ncontestants would seem to indicate. Saxony, which inclined more\r\nnaturally to Austrian than to Prussian friendship, was easily persuaded\r\nby bribes to desert her allies and to make peace with Maria Theresa.\r\nSpain would fight only in Italy; and Sardinia, alarmed by the prospect\r\nof substantial Bourbon gains in that peninsula, went over to the side\r\nof Austria. The Dutch were content to defend their own territories.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Success of Frederick]\r\n\r\nDespite the greatest exertions, Maria Theresa was unable to expel\r\nFrederick from Silesia. Her generals suffered repeated reverses at his\r\nhands, and three times she was forced to recognize his occupation in\r\norder that she might employ all her forces against her western enemies.\r\nBy the third treaty between the two German sovereigns, concluded at\r\nDresden in 1745, Silesia [Footnote: Except a very small district, which\r\nthereafter was known as \"Austrian Silesia.\"] was definitely ceded by\r\nAustria to Prussia. Frederick had gained his ends: he coolly deserted\r\nhis allies and withdrew from the war.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Austrian arms had elsewhere been more successful. The\r\nFrench and Bavarians, after winning a few trifling victories in\r\nBohemia, had been forced back to the upper Danube. Munich was occupied\r\nby the troops of Maria Theresa at the very time when the elector was\r\nbeing crowned at Frankfort as Holy Roman Emperor. The whole of Bavaria\r\nwas soon in Austrian possession, and the French were in retreat across\r\nthe Rhine. Gradually, also, the combined forces of Austria and Sardinia\r\nmade headway in Italy against the Bourbon armies of France and Spain.\r\n\r\nIn the last years of the war, the French managed to protect Alsace and\r\nLorraine from Austrian invasion, and, under the command of the gifted\r\nMarshal Saxe, they actually succeeded in subjugating the greater part\r\nof the Austrian Netherlands and in carrying the struggle into Holland.\r\nOn the high seas and in the colonies, the conflict raged between France\r\nand Great Britain as \"King George's War,\" which has already been\r\nseparately noted. [Footnote: See above, pp. 311 f.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treaties of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748): Indecisive Character of\r\nStruggle between Prussia and Austria]\r\n\r\nThe treaties which ended the War of the Austrian Succession were signed\r\nat Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. They guaranteed the acquisition of Silesia\r\nby Frederick II of Prussia and restored everything else to the\r\nsituation at the opening of the conflict. The Wittelsbach family was\r\nreinstated in Bavaria and in the Palatinate, and the husband of Maria\r\nTheresa, Francis of Lorraine, succeeded Charles VII as Holy Roman\r\nEmperor. France, for all her expenditures and sacrifices, gained\r\nnothing. The War of the Austrian Succession was but a preliminary\r\nencounter in the great duel for German leadership between Prussia and\r\nAustria. It was similarly only an indecisive round in the prolonged\r\nbattle between France and Great Britain for the mastery of the colonial\r\nand commercial world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Coalition against Frederick the Great]\r\n\r\nIn the war just closed, Austria had been the chief loser, and the\r\nresolute Maria Theresa set herself at once to the difficult task of\r\nrecovering her prestige and her ceded territory. Her first efforts were\r\ndirected toward internal reform--consolidating the administrations of\r\nher various dominions by the creation of a strong central council at\r\nVienna, encouraging agriculture, equalizing and augmenting the taxes,\r\nand increasing the army. Her next step was to form a great league of\r\nrulers that would find a common interest with her in dismembering the\r\nkingdom of Frederick. She knew she could count on Saxony. She easily\r\nsecured an ally in the Tsarina Elizabeth of Russia, who had been deeply\r\noffended by the caustic wit of the Prussian king. She was already\r\nunited by friendly agreements with Great Britain and Holland. She had\r\nonly France to win to her side, and in this policy she had the services\r\nof an invaluable agent, Count Kaunitz, the greatest diplomat of the\r\nage. Kaunitz held out to France, as the price for the abandonment of\r\nthe Prussian alliance and the acceptance of that of Austria, the\r\ntempting bait of Frederick's Rhenish provinces. But Louis XV at first\r\nrefused an Austrian alliance: it would be a departure from the\r\ntraditional French policy of opposing the Habsburgs. Kaunitz then\r\nappealed to the king's mistress, the ambitious Madame de Pompadour,\r\nwho, like the Tsarina Elizabeth, had had plenty of occasions for taking\r\noffense at the witty verses of the Prussian monarch: the favor of the\r\nPompadour was won, and France entered the league against Prussia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Diplomatic Revolution\"]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, Great Britain had entered into a special agreement\r\nwith Frederick with the object of guaranteeing the integrity of Hanover\r\nand the general peace of the Germanies. When, therefore, the colonial\r\nwar between Great Britain and France was renewed in 1754, it was quite\r\nnatural that the former should contract a definite alliance with\r\nPrussia. Thus it befell that, whereas in the indecisive War of the\r\nAustrian Succession Prussia and France were pitted against Austria and\r\nGreat Britain, in the determinant Seven Years' War, which ensued,\r\nAustria and France were in arms against Prussia and Great Britain. This\r\noverturn of traditional alliances has been commonly designated the\r\n\"Diplomatic Revolution.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Seven Years' War, 1756-1763]\r\n\r\nThe Seven Years' War lasted in Europe from 1756 to 1763, and, as\r\nregards both the number of combatants and the brilliant generalship\r\ndisplayed, deserves to rank with the War of the Spanish Succession as\r\nthe greatest war which the modern world had so far witnessed. The story\r\nhas already been told of its maritime and colonial counterpart, which\r\nembraced the French and Indian War in America (1754-1763) and the\r\ntriumphant campaigns of Clive in India, and which decisively\r\nestablished the supremacy of Great Britain on the seas, in the Far\r\nEast, and in the New World. [Footnote: See above, pp. 312 ff.] There\r\nremains to sketch its course on the European continent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Frederick's Victory at Rossbach, 1757]\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for a formal declaration of hostilities, Frederick\r\nseized Saxony, from which he exacted large indemnities and drafted\r\nnumerous recruits, and, with his well-trained veteran troops, crossed\r\nthe mountains into Bohemia. He was obliged by superior Austrian forces\r\nto raise the siege of Prague and to fall back on his own kingdom.\r\nThence converged from all sides the allied armies of his enemies.\r\nRussians moved into East Prussia, Swedes from Pomerania into northern\r\nBrandenburg, Austrians into Silesia, while the French were advancing\r\nfrom the west. Here it was that Frederick displayed those qualities\r\nwhich entitle him to rank as one of the greatest military commanders of\r\nall time and to justify his title of \"the Great.\" Inferior in numbers\r\nto any one of his opponents, he dashed with lightning rapidity into\r\ncentral Germany and at Rossbach (1757) inflicted an overwhelming defeat\r\nupon the French, whose general wrote to Louis XV, \"The rout of our army\r\nis complete: I cannot tell you how many of our officers have been\r\nkilled, captured, or lost.\" No sooner was he relieved of danger in the\r\nwest than he was back in Silesia. He flung himself upon the Austrians\r\nat Leuthen, took captive a third of their army, and put the rest to\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nThe victories of Frederick, however, decimated his army. He still had\r\nmoney, thanks to the subsidies which Pitt poured in from Great Britain,\r\nbut he found it very difficult to procure men: he gathered recruits\r\nfrom hostile countries; he granted amnesty to deserters; he even\r\nenrolled prisoners of war. He was no longer sufficiently sure of his\r\nsoldiers to take the offensive, and for five years he was reduced to\r\ndefensive campaigns in Silesia. The Russians occupied East Prussia and\r\npenetrated into Brandenburg; in 1759 they captured Berlin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French Reverses. The \"Family Compact\"]\r\n\r\nThe French, after suffering defeat at Rossbach, directed their energies\r\nagainst Hanover but encountered unexpected resistance at the hands of\r\nan army collected by Pitt's gold and commanded by a Prussian general,\r\nthe prince of Brunswick. Brunswick defeated them and gradually drove\r\nthem out of Germany. This series of reverses, coupled with disasters\r\nthat attended French armies in America and in India, caused the French\r\nking to call upon his cousin, the king of Spain, for assistance. The\r\nresult was the formation of the defensive alliance (1761) between the\r\nBourbon states of France, Spain, and the Two Sicilies, and the entrance\r\nof Spain into the war (1762).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Withdrawal of Russia]\r\n\r\nWhat really saved Frederick the Great was the death of the Tsarina\r\nElizabeth (1762) and the accession to the Russian throne of Peter III,\r\na dangerous madman but a warm admirer of the military prowess of the\r\nPrussian king. Peter in brusque style transferred the Russian forces\r\nfrom the standard of Maria Theresa to that of Frederick and restored to\r\nPrussia the conquests of his predecessor. [Footnote: Peter III was\r\ndethroned in the same year; his wife, Catherine II, who succeeded him,\r\nrefused to give active military support to either side.] Spain entered\r\nthe war too late to affect its fortunes materially. She was unable to\r\nregain what France had lost, and in fact the Bourbon states were\r\nutterly exhausted. The Austrians, after frantic but vain attempts to\r\nwrest Silesia from Frederick, finally despaired of their cause.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treaty of Hubertusburg (1763): Humiliation of the Habsburgs\r\nand Triumph of the Hohenzollerns]\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Hubertusburg (1763) put an end to the Seven Years' War in\r\nEurope. Maria Theresa finally, though reluctantly, surrendered all\r\nclaims to Silesia. Prussia had clearly humiliated Austria and become a\r\nfirst-rate power. The Hohenzollerns were henceforth the acknowledged\r\npeers of the Habsburgs. The almost synchronous treaty of Paris closed\r\nthe war between Great Britain, on the one hand, and France and Spain on\r\nthe other, by ceding the bulk of the French colonial empire to the\r\nBritish. Thereafter, Great Britain was practically undisputed mistress\r\nof the seas and chief colonial power of the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Frederick the Great and the Partition of Poland]\r\n\r\nFrederick the Great devoted the last years of his life to the\r\nconsolidation of his monarchy [Footnote: For the internal reforms of\r\nFrederick, see below, pp. 440 ff.] and to enlarging its sphere of\r\ninfluence rather by diplomacy than by war. Frederick felt that the best\r\nsafeguard against further attempts of Austria to recover Silesia was a\r\nfirm alliance between Prussia and Russia. And it was an outcome of that\r\nalliance that in 1772 he joined with the Tsarina Catherine in making\r\nthe first partition of Poland. Catherine appropriated the country east\r\nof the Düna and the Dnieper rivers. Frederick annexed West Prussia,\r\nexcept the towns of Danzig and Thorn, thereby linking up Prussia and\r\nBrandenburg by a continuous line of territory. Maria Theresa, moved by\r\nthe loss of Silesia and by fear of the undue preponderance which the\r\npartition of Poland would give to her northern rivals, thought to\r\nadjust the balance of power by sharing in the shameful transaction: she\r\noccupied Galicia, including the important city of Cracow. Maria Theresa\r\nrepeatedly expressed her abhorrence of the whole business, but, as the\r\nscoffing Frederick said, \"She wept, but she kept on taking.\"\r\n\r\nThe partition of Poland was more favorable to Prussia than to Austria.\r\nIn the former case, the land annexed lay along the Baltic and served to\r\nrender East Prussia, Brandenburg, and Silesia a geographical and\r\npolitical unit. On the other hand, Austria to some extent was\r\npositively weakened by the acquisition of territory outside her natural\r\nfrontiers, and the addition of a turbulent Polish people further\r\nincreased the diversity of races and the clash of interests within the\r\nHabsburg dominions.\r\n\r\nWhen, a few years later, the succession to the electorate of Bavaria\r\nwas in some doubt and Austria laid claims to the greater part of that\r\nstate (1777-1779), Frederick again stepped in, and now by intrigue and\r\nnow by threats of armed force again prevented any considerable\r\nextension of Habsburg control. His last important act was the formation\r\nof a league of princes to champion the lesser German states against\r\nAustrian aggression.\r\n\r\nBy hard work, by military might, by force of will, unhampered by any\r\nmoral code, Frederick the Great perfected the policies of the Great\r\nElector and of Frederick William I and raised Prussia to the rank of\r\npartner with Austria in German leadership and to an eminent position in\r\nthe international affairs of Europe. Had Frederick lived, however, but\r\na score of years longer, he would have witnessed the total extinction\r\nof the Holy Roman Empire, the apparent ruin of the Germanies, and the\r\ndegradation of his own country as well as that of Austria. [Footnote:\r\nSee below, Chapter XVI.] He might even have perceived that a personal\r\ndespotism, built by bloodshed and unblushing deceit, was hardly proof\r\nagainst a nation stirred by idealism and by a consciousness of its own\r\nrights and power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOHENZOLLERN FAMILY (1415-1915): ELECTORS OF\r\nBRANDENBURG, KINGS OF PRUSSIA, AND GERMAN EMPERORS]\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL READING\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL.

It was not until the\r\neighteenth century that Russia came into close contact with the\r\ncommerce and culture of western Christendom; not until then did she\r\nbecome a great power in the European family of nations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russian Expansion]\r\n\r\nSeveral occurrences during the two centuries which separated the reign\r\nof the Tsar Ivan the Great from that of Peter the Great paved the way\r\nfor the subsequent, almost startling rise of the powerful empire of\r\nnorthern and eastern Europe. The first in importance was the expansion\r\nof the Russian race and dominion. Throughout the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries the farming folk of the region about Moscow were\r\nemigrating south and east and establishing themselves in the fertile\r\nplains of the Don, the Volga, and the Irtysh. [Footnote: Armies of the\r\ntsar backed up the colonists: they occupied Kazan in 1552 and\r\nAstrakhan, near the Caspian Sea, in 1554.] A glance at the map of\r\nRussia will show how the network of rivers combined with the level\r\ncharacter of the country to facilitate this process of racial\r\nexpansion. The gentle southerly flowing Dnieper, Don, and Volga,\r\nradiating from the same central region, and connected by way of the\r\nKama with the headwaters of the Dwina, which empties into the White Sea\r\nin the extreme north, became chief channels of trade and migration, and\r\ncontributed much more to the elaboration of national unity than any\r\npolitical institutions. Boats could be conveyed over flat and easy\r\nportages from one river-basin to another, and these portages with a\r\nrelatively small amount of labor were gradually changed into navigable\r\nchannels, so that even now the canals are more important than many of\r\nthe railways as arteries of commerce.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Cossacks]\r\n\r\nAs the emigrants threaded their way along the river courses and over\r\nthe broad plains they had to be constantly on the alert against attacks\r\nof troublesome natives, and they accordingly organized themselves in\r\nsemi-military fashion. Those in the vanguard of territorial expansion\r\nconstituted a peculiar class known as Cossacks, who, like frontiersmen\r\nof other times and places, for example, like those that gained for the\r\nUnited States its vast western domain, lived a wild life in which\r\nagricultural and pastoral pursuits were intermingled with hunting and\r\nfighting. In the basins of the southern rivers, the Cossacks formed\r\nsemi-independent military communities: those of the Volga and the Don\r\nprofessed allegiance to the tsar of Muscovy, while those of the Dnieper\r\nusually recognized the sovereignty of the king of Poland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Eastword Expansion into Asia]\r\n\r\nNor was the migration of the Russian race restricted to Europe. The\r\ndivision between Europe and Asia is largely imaginary, as another\r\nglance at the map will prove,--the low-lying Urals are a barrier only\r\ntoward the north, while southward the plains of Russia stretch on\r\ninterminably above the Caspian until they are merged in the steppes of\r\nSiberia. Across these plains moved a steady stream of Cossacks and\r\npeasants and adventurers, carrying with them the habits and traditions\r\nof their Russian homes. Ever eastward wended the emigrants. They\r\nfounded Tobolsk in 1587 and Tomsk in 1604; they established Yakutsk on\r\nthe Lena River in 1632, and Irkutsk on Lake Baikal in 1652; in 1638\r\nthey reached the Sea of Okhotsk, and, by the close of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, they occupied the peninsula of Kamchatka and looked upon the\r\nbroad Pacific. Thus at the time when the Spaniards were extending their\r\nspeech and laws throughout South America and the English were laying\r\nthe foundations for the predominance of their institutions in North\r\nAmerica, the Russians were appropriating northern Asia and\r\ndemonstrating that, with them at least, the course of empire takes its\r\nway eastward.\r\n\r\nIvan the Great had already been described in church service as \"the\r\nruler and autocrat of all Russia, the new Tsar Constantine [Footnote:\r\nThe last Cæsar of the Græco-Roman Empire, Constantine XI, had perished\r\nin 1453 in vain defense of Constantinople against the Turks. It was a\r\nsignificant fact that the Russian rulers, who owed their Christianity\r\nand their nation's culture to the Greeks, should now revive the title\r\nof Caesar (Russian form, tsar or czar).] in the new city of\r\nConstantine, Moscow.\" His successors invariably had themselves crowned\r\nas tsars and autocrats of all Russia. By military might they maintained\r\ntheir control over the ever-widening territories of the Russian people;\r\nwith racial pride and religious fervor, the distant emigrants regarded\r\ntheir royal family at Moscow. The power of the tsars kept pace with the\r\nexpansion of the state.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oriental Characteristics of Russia]\r\n\r\nYet this greater Russia remained essentially Oriental. Its form of\r\nChristianity was derived from the East rather than from the West. Its\r\nsocial customs savored more of Asia than of Europe. Its nobles and even\r\nits tsars were rated by western Christendom as little better than\r\nbarbarians. In fact, the Russian state was looked upon in the\r\nseventeenth century in much the same way as China was regarded in the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for this relative backwardness are not hard to ascertain.\r\nIn the first place, the religion of the state was a direct heritage of\r\nthe expiring Eastern Empire and was different from either the\r\nCatholicism or the Protestantism of western Europe. Secondly, long and\r\nclose contact with the conquering Mongols or Tatars of Asia had\r\nsaturated the Russian people with Oriental customs and\r\nhabits.[Footnote: See above, pp. 21 f.] Thirdly, the nature of the\r\ncountry tended to exalt agriculture and to discourage industry and\r\nforeign commerce, and at the same time to turn emigration and expansion\r\neastward rather than westward. Finally, so long as the neighboring\r\nwestern states of Sweden, Poland, and Turkey remained powerful and\r\nretained the entire coast of the Baltic and Black seas, Russia was\r\ndeprived of seaports that would enable her to engage in traffic with\r\nwestern Europe and thus to partake of the common culture of\r\nChristendom.\r\n\r\nNot until Russia was modernized and westernized, and had made\r\nconsiderable headway against one or all of her western neighbors, could\r\nshe hope to become a European Power. Not until the accession of the\r\nRomanov dynasty did she enter seriously upon this twofold policy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Troublous Times\"]\r\n\r\nThe direct line of Ivan the Great had died out at the close of the\r\nsixteenth century, and there ensued what in Russian history are known\r\nas \"the troublous times.\" Disputes over the succession led to a series\r\nof civil wars, and the consequent anarchy invited foreign intervention.\r\nFor a time the Poles harassed the country and even occupied the\r\nKremlin, or citadel, of Moscow. The Swedes, also, took advantage of the\r\ntroublous times in Russia to enlarge their conquests on the eastern\r\nshore of the Baltic and to seize the important trading center of\r\nNovgorod. In the south, the Turks warred with the Cossacks and brought\r\nmany of the Crimean principalities under their control.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Accession of the Romanovs, 1613]\r\n\r\nUnder these discouraging circumstances a great national assembly met at\r\nMoscow in 1613 to elect a tsar, and their choice fell upon one of their\r\nown number, a certain Michael Romanov, whose family had been connected\r\nby marriage ties with the ancient royal line. It is an interesting fact\r\nthat the present autocrat of Russia is a lineal descendant of the\r\nRomanov who was thus popularly elected to supreme authority in 1613.\r\n\r\nMichael Romanov proved an excellent choice. Accepted by all classes, he\r\nreestablished order and security throughout the country and\r\nsuccessfully resisted foreign encroachments. He founded several\r\nfortified towns in the south against the Tatars and the Turks. He\r\nrecovered Novgorod from the Swedes. During the reign of his son, Polish\r\ndepredations were stopped and the Dnieper River was fixed upon\r\n[Footnote: Treaty of Andrussovo (1667), in accordance with which Poland\r\nceded to Russia Kiev, Smolensk, and eastern Ukraine.] as the general\r\ndividing line between Poland and Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETER THE GREAT\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His Accession and Early Travels]\r\n\r\nThe grandson of Michael Romanov was the celebrated Peter the Great, who\r\nmay rightfully be designated as the father of modern Russia. His older\r\nbrothers, with whom during his youth he was nominally associated in the\r\ngovernment, died in turn without leaving direct heirs, and Peter became\r\nsole ruler in 1696. From the outset he showed an insatiable curiosity\r\nabout the arts and sciences of western Europe, the authority of its\r\nkings and the organization of its armies and fleets. To an intense\r\ncuriosity, Peter added an indomitable will. He was resolved to satisfy\r\nhis every curiosity and to utilize whatever he learned or found.\r\n\r\nFrom childhood, Peter had displayed an aptitude for mechanical tools\r\nand inventions and especially for boat-making. Shipbuilding and ship-\r\nsailing became his favorite pastimes. When he was barely twenty-one, he\r\nlaunched at Archangel, on the ice-bound White Sea, a ship which he had\r\nbuilt with his own hands. Now in 1696, being sole tsar at the age of\r\ntwenty-four, he fitted out a fleet which defeated the Turks on the\r\nBlack Sea and allowed him to capture the valuable port of Azov. No\r\nother successes were gained, however, in this Turkish War; and the\r\nyoung tsar began to perceive that if he were to succeed in his\r\ncherished project he would have to obtain Western aid. In 1697,\r\ntherefore, a special commission left Moscow for the purpose of\r\nsoliciting the cooperation of the principal Powers against Turkey, and\r\nto this commission the young tsar attached himself as a volunteer\r\nsailor, \"Peter Mikhailov,\" in order that he might incidentally learn\r\nmuch about ship-building and other technical sciences.\r\n\r\nIn its primary purpose, the Russian commission failed signally. Western\r\nEurope was on the eve of the War of the Spanish Succession, and all the\r\nEuropean sovereigns seemed to be engrossed in the distractions of\r\ndynastic politics. No help against the Turks was forthcoming. But\r\npersonally Peter learned many useful things. In Holland he studied\r\nship-building as well as anatomy and engraving. In England he\r\ninvestigated industry and commerce. He closely scrutinized the military\r\nestablishment of Prussia. In all places which he visited he collected\r\nartisans, sailors, engineers, or other workmen, whom he sent back to\r\nRussia to instruct his people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Suppression of the Streltsi]\r\n\r\nWhile he was on his way from Vienna to Venice, news reached him that\r\nthe royal bodyguard, called the _streltsi_, had taken advantage of\r\nhis absence of a year and a half and had mutinied at Moscow. In hot\r\nhaste he hurried home and wreaked dire vengeance upon the mutineers.\r\nTwo thousand were hung or broken on the wheel, five thousand were\r\nbeheaded, and Peter for many days amused himself and edified his court\r\nby the wonderful dexterity he displayed in slicing off the heads of\r\n_streltsi_ with his own royal arm.\r\n\r\nThe severe punishment of the rebellious _streltsi_ and the\r\nimmediate abolition of their military organization was clear evidence\r\nthat Peter was fully determined both to break with the past traditions\r\nof his country and to compel all the Russian people to do likewise.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Military Reform]\r\n\r\nHis first care was the reconstruction of the army on the Prussian\r\nmodel. Officered and disciplined by foreigners dependent entirely upon\r\nthe tsar, the new army replaced the _streltsi_ and proved a potent\r\nfactor in furthering the domestic and foreign policies of Peter the\r\nGreat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Introduction of Occidental Customs]\r\n\r\nThe young reformer next turned his attention to the customs of his\r\npeople--their clothing and manners--which he would transform from\r\nOriental to Occidental. Edict followed edict with amazing rapidity. The\r\nchief potentates of the empire were solemnly assembled so that Peter\r\nwith his own hand might deliberately clip off their long beards and\r\nflowing mustaches. A heavy tax was imposed on such as persisted in\r\nwearing beards. French or German clothes were to be substituted, under\r\npenalty of large fines, for the traditional Russian costume. The use of\r\ntobacco was made compulsory. The Oriental semi-seclusion of women was\r\nprohibited. Both sexes were to mingle freely in the festivities of the\r\ncourt. These innovations were largely superficial: they partially\r\npermeated the nobility and clergy, but made little impression on the\r\nmass of the population. Peter had begun a work, however, which was\r\ncertain of great results in the future.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Development of Autocracy]\r\n\r\nThe reign of Peter the Great is notable for the removal of serious\r\nchecks upon the power of the tsar and the definitive establishment of\r\nthat form of absolutism which in Russia is called \"autocracy.\" By sheer\r\nability and will-power, the tsar was qualified to play the role of\r\ndivine-right monarch, and his observation of the centralized government\r\nof Louis XIV, as well as the appreciation of his country's needs,\r\nconvinced him that that kind of government was the most suitable for\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Subordination of the Orthodox Church to the Russian State]\r\n[Sidenote: The Holy Synod]\r\n\r\nWe have already observed how Peter replaced the independent, turbulent\r\n_streltsi_ with a thoroughly devoted and orderly standing army.\r\nThat was one important step in the direction of autocracy. The next was\r\nthe subordination of the Church to the state. The tsar understood the\r\nvery great influence which the Holy Orthodox Church exerted over the\r\nRussian people and the danger to his policies that ecclesiastical\r\nopposition might create. He was naturally anxious that the Church\r\nshould become the ally, not the enemy, of autocracy. He, therefore,\r\ntook such steps as would exalt the Church in the opinion of his\r\ncountrymen and at the same time would render it a serviceable agent of\r\nthe government. Professing the warmest faith in its religious tenets,\r\nhe deprived the patriarch [Footnote: Until late in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, the metropolitan of Moscow was in theory under the authority\r\nof the patriarch of Constantinople; thereafter, through Boris Godunov,\r\nhe became independent with full consent and approval of the whole Greek\r\nOrthodox Church and was styled the patriarch of Moscow.] of Moscow of\r\nhis privilege of controlling the ecclesiastical organization and vested\r\nall powers of church government in a body, called the Holy Synod, whose\r\nmembers were bishops and whose chief was a layman, all chosen by the\r\ntsar himself. No appointment to ecclesiastical office could henceforth\r\nbe made without the approval of the Holy Synod; no sermon could be\r\npreached and no book could be published unless it had received the\r\nsanction of that august body. The authority which the tsar thereby\r\nobtained over the Russian Church was as complete and far-reaching as\r\nthat which Henry VIII had acquired, two centuries earlier, over the\r\nAnglican Church. The results have been in keeping with Peter's fondest\r\nexpectations, for the Orthodox Church in Russia has been from his time\r\nto the present the right-hand support of absolutism. The tsars have\r\nexalted the Church as the fountain of order and holiness; as a\r\nveritable ark of the covenant have the clergy magnified and extolled\r\nthe autocracy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Secular Power of the Tsar]\r\n\r\nA remodeling of the secular government of Russia along autocratic lines\r\nwas another achievement of Peter the Great which long endured. At the\r\nhead of the state was the tsar or emperor, possessing absolute,\r\nunlimited powers. An ancient assembly, or Duma, of nobles, which had\r\nformerly exercised vague legislative rights, was practically abolished,\r\nits place being taken by an advisory Council of State whose members,\r\nusually noblemen, were selected by the tsar. All traces of local self-\r\ngovernment were similarly swept away, and the country was henceforth\r\nadministered by the tsar's personal agents. To enforce his autocratic\r\nwill, a system of police was organized on a militia basis, its chiefs\r\nbeing made dependent on the central authority. In these, as in all his\r\nother reforms, the tsar encountered a good deal of opposition, and for\r\na while was obliged to rely largely on foreigners to carry them out. As\r\nsoon as possible, however, Peter employed natives, for it was a\r\ncardinal point in his policy that the Russians themselves must manage\r\ntheir own state without foreign interference or help.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attempted Social Reforms of Peter the Great]\r\n\r\nLike his contemporaries in western Europe, Peter gave considerable\r\nattention to the economic condition of the monarchy. He strove, though\r\noften in a bungling manner, to promote agriculture and to improve the\r\nlot of the peasantry, who still constituted the overwhelming bulk of\r\nforms of the population. He certainly deprived the nobles of many of\r\ntheir former privileges and sought to rest political power and social\r\nposition on ability rather than on birth. He understood that Russia\r\ngrievously lacked a numerous and prosperous middle class, and he aimed\r\nto create one by encouraging trade and industries. His almost constant\r\nparticipation in wars, however, prevented him from bringing many of his\r\neconomic and social plans to fruition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ambitious Foreign Policy of Peter the Great]\r\n\r\nInternal reforms were but one-half of Peter's ambitious program. To him\r\nRussia owes not only the abolition of the _streltsi_, the loss of\r\nthe independence of the Church, the Europeanization of manners and\r\ncustoms, and the firm establishment of autocracy, but also the\r\npronouncement and enforcement of an elaborate scheme of foreign\r\naggrandizement. On one hand, the tsar showed a lively interest in the\r\nexploration and colonization of Siberia and in the extension of Russian\r\ndominion around the Caspian Sea and towards the Persian Empire. On the\r\nother hand,--and this, for our purposes, is far more important,--he was\r\nresolved to make the cultural and commercial connection between Russia\r\nand Europe strong and intimate, to open a way to the west by gaining\r\noutlets on both the Black and Baltic seas--\"windows\" to the west, as he\r\ntermed them.\r\n\r\nOn the Baltic Sea, Sweden blocked him; toward the Black Sea, the\r\nOttoman power hemmed him in. It was, therefore, against Sweden and\r\nTurkey that Peter the Great waged war. It seemed to him a matter of\r\ndire necessity for the preservation of European civilization in Russia\r\nthat he should defeat one or both of these states. Against the Turks,\r\nas events proved, he made little headway; against the Swedes he fared\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nIn order that we may understand the nature of the momentous conflict\r\nbetween Russia and Sweden in the first quarter of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, it will be necessary at this point to notice the parallel\r\ndevelopment of Sweden.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEDEN AND THE CAREER OF CHARLES XII\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sweden a Great Power in the Seventeenth Century]\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that a century before Peter the Great, the\r\nremarkable Gustavus Adolphus had aimed to make the Baltic a Swedish\r\nlake. To his own kingdom, lying along the western shore of that sea,\r\nand to the dependency of Finland, he had added by conquest the eastern\r\nprovinces of Karelia, Ingria, Esthonia, and Livonia [Footnote: Livonia,\r\noccupied by Gustavus Adolphus during the Polish War of 1621-1629, was\r\nnot formally relinquished by Poland until 1660. Esthonia had been\r\nconquered by the Swedes in 1561, but Russia did not renounce her\r\npretensions to this province until 1617.], and his successful\r\ninterference in the Thirty Years' War had given Sweden possession of\r\nwestern Pomerania and the mouths of the Elbe, Oder, and Weser rivers\r\nand a considerable influence in German affairs. For many years after\r\nthe death of Gustavus Adolphus, Sweden was the recognized leader of\r\ncontinental Protestantism, and her trade on the Baltic grew and\r\nthrived. The exports of Russia and Poland found a convenient outlet\r\nthrough the Swedish port of Riga, and those of the northern Germanics\r\nwere frequently dispatched on Swedish vessels from Stettin or\r\nStralsund.\r\n\r\nRepeated efforts were made by Denmark, Poland, and Brandenburg to break\r\nthe commercial monopoly which Sweden enjoyed upon the Baltic and to\r\ndeprive her of her conquests, but for a long time in vain. Victory\r\ncontinued to attend Swedish arms and a general treaty in 1660 confirmed\r\nher dominion. At that time Sweden was not only a military power of the\r\nfirst magnitude but also one of the largest states of Europe,\r\npossessing about twice as much area as present-day Sweden. Her area\r\nembraced a land-surface 7000 square miles larger than the modern German\r\nEmpire. All the islands and the greater part of the coast of the Baltic\r\nbelonged to her. Stockholm, the capital, lay in the very center of the\r\nempire, whose second city was Riga, on the other side of the sea. In\r\npolitics, in religion, and in trade, Sweden was feared and respected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Elements of Weakness in Sweden's Position]\r\n\r\nYet the greatness of Sweden in the seventeenth century was more\r\napparent than real. Her commerce provoked the jealousy of all her\r\nneighbors. Her dependencies across the Baltic were difficult to hold:\r\npeopled by Finns, Russians, Poles, Germans, and Danes, their bond with\r\nSweden was essentially artificial, and they usually sympathized,\r\nnaturally enough, with their sovereign's enemies. They, therefore,\r\nimposed on the mother country the duty of remaining a military\r\nmonarchy, armed from head to foot for every possible emergency. For\r\nsuch a tremendous destiny Sweden was quite unfitted. Her wide territory\r\nwas very sparsely populated, and her peasantry were very poor. Only the\r\nFrench alliance gave her solid backing in the Germanies, and, with the\r\ndecline of the fortunes of Louis XIV and the rise of Prussia and\r\nRussia, she was bound to lose her leadership in the North.\r\n\r\nTo the fate of Sweden, her rulers in the seventeenth century\r\ncontributed no small share. Nearly all of them were born fighters and\r\nnearly all of them were neglectful of home interests and of the works\r\nof peace. The military instincts of the Swedish kings not only\r\nsacrificed thousands of lives that were urgently needed in building up\r\ntheir country and cost the kingdom enormous sums of money but likewise\r\nimpaired commerce, surrounded the empire with a broad belt of desolated\r\nterritory, and implanted an ineradicable hatred in every adjacent\r\nstate. Then, too, the extravagance and negligence of the sovereigns led\r\nto chaos in domestic government. Taxes were heavy and badly\r\napportioned. The nobles recovered many of their political privileges.\r\nThe royal power steadily dwindled away at the very time when it was\r\nmost needed; and a selfish, grasping aristocracy hastened their\r\ncountry's ruin. [Footnote: A reaction appeared under the capable\r\nCharles XI (1660-1697), but its fruits were completely lost by his son\r\nand successor, Charles XII.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Coalition against Charles XII]\r\n\r\nAt length, in 1697, when Charles XII, a boy of fifteen years, ascended\r\nthe throne of Sweden, the neighboring Powers thought the time had\r\narrived to partition his territories among themselves. Tsar Peter,\r\nwhile returning home the following year from his travels abroad, had\r\ndiscussed with Augustus II, elector of Saxony and king of Poland, a\r\nplan which the latter had formed for the dismemberment of the Swedish\r\nEmpire: Poland was to recover Livonia and annex Esthonia; Russia was to\r\nobtain Ingria and Karelia and thereby a port on the Baltic; Brandenburg\r\nwas to occupy western Pomerania; and Denmark was to take possession of\r\nHolstein and the mouths of the Elbe and Weser. Charles XII was to\r\nretain only his kingdom in the Scandinavian peninsula and the grand\r\nduchy of Finland. At the last moment Brandenburg balked, but Saxony,\r\nDenmark, and Russia signed the nefarious alliance in 1699. The allies\r\nexpected quick and decisive victory. All western and southern Europe\r\nwas on the verge of a great struggle for the Spanish inheritance and\r\nwould clearly be unable to prevent them from despoiling Sweden.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Military Exploits of Charles XII]\r\n\r\nBut the allies grossly underrated their foe. Charles XII was a mere\r\nboy, but precocious, gloomy, and sensitive, and endowed with all the\r\nmartial determination and heroism of his ancestors. He desired nothing\r\nbetter than to fight against overwhelming odds, and the fury of the\r\nyouthful commander soon earned him the sobriquet of the \"madman of the\r\nNorth.\" The alliance of 1699 precipitated the Great Northern War which\r\nwas to last until 1721 and slowly, but no less inevitably, lower Sweden\r\nto the position of a third-rate power. It was amid the most spectacular\r\nexploits of the boy-king that the ruin of Sweden was accomplished. It\r\nwas a grander but more tragic fate than in the same period befell\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nCharles XII did not give the allies time to unite. Hurriedly crossing\r\nthe straits, he invaded Denmark, whose terrified king promptly signed a\r\ntreaty with him (1700), paying a large indemnity and engaging to keep\r\nthe peace in future.\r\n\r\nThence Charles hastened across the Baltic to Esthonia in order to deal\r\nwith the invading Russians. At Narva he met and annihilated their army.\r\nThen he turned southward, clearing Livonia and Lithuania of Poles,\r\nSaxons, and Russians.\r\n\r\nInto the very heart of Poland he carried the war, possessing himself of\r\nboth Warsaw and Cracow. He obliged the Polish Diet to dethrone Augustus\r\nand to accept a king of his own choice in the person of a certain\r\nStanislaus Leszczynski (1704).\r\n\r\nAll these things had been done by a young man between the age of\r\nseventeen and twenty--two. It was quite natural that he should be\r\npuffed up with pride in his ability and successes. It was almost as\r\nnatural that, hardened at an early age to the horrors of war, he should\r\nbecome increasingly callous and cruel. Many instructions the impulsive\r\nyouth sent out over conquered districts in Russia, Poland, and Saxony\r\n\"to slay, burn, and destroy.\" \"Better that the innocent suffer than\r\nthat the guilty escape\" was his favorite adage.\r\n\r\nSmall wonder, then, that neither Peter the Great nor the Elector\r\nAugustus would abandon the struggle. While Charles was overrunning\r\nPoland, Peter was reorganizing his army and occupying Karelia and\r\nIngria; and when the Swedish king returned to engage the Russians,\r\nAugustus drove out Stanislaus and regained the crown of Poland. Yet\r\nCharles, with an unreasoning stubbornness, would not perceive that the\r\ntime had arrived for terminating the conflict with a few concessions.\r\nRussia at that time asked only a port on the Gulf of Finland as the\r\nprice of an alliance against Poland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Poltava (1709): Defeat of Charles XII]\r\n\r\nTo all entreaties for peace, Charles XII turned a deaf ear, and pressed\r\nthe war in Russia. Unable to take Moscow, he turned southward in order\r\nto effect a juncture with some rebellious Cossacks, but met the army of\r\nPeter the Great at Poltava (1709). Poltava marks the decisive triumph\r\nof Russia over Sweden. The Swedish army was destroyed, only a small\r\nnumber being able to accompany the flight of their king across the\r\nsouthern Russian frontier into Turkish territory.\r\n\r\nThen Charles stirred up the Turks to attack the tsar, but from the new\r\ncontest he was himself unable to profit. Peter bought peace with the\r\nOttoman government by re-ceding the town of Azov, and the latter\r\ngradually tired of their guest's continual and frantic clamor for war.\r\nAfter a sojourn of over five years in Ottoman lands, Charles suddenly\r\nand unexpectedly appeared, with but a single attendant, at Stralsund,\r\nwhich by that time was all that remained to him outside of Sweden and\r\nFinland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Obstinacy and Death of Charles XII]\r\n\r\nStill, however, the war dragged on. The allies grew in numbers and in\r\ndemands. Peter the Great and Augustus were again joined by the Danish\r\nking. Great Britain, Hanover, and Prussia, all covetous of Swedish\r\ntrade or Swedish territory, were now members of the coalition. Charles\r\nXII stood like adamant: he would retain all or he would lose all. So he\r\nstood until the last. It was while he was directing an invasion of\r\nNorway that the brilliant but ill-balanced Charles lost his life\r\n(1718), being then but thirty-six years of age.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decline of Sweden]\r\n\r\nPeace which had been impossible during the lifetime of Charles, became\r\na reality soon after his death. It certainly came none too soon for the\r\nexhausted and enfeebled condition of Sweden. By the treaties of\r\nStockholm (1719 and 1720), Sweden resigned all her German holdings\r\nexcept a small district of western Pomerania including the town of\r\nStralsund. Denmark received Holstein and a money indemnity. Hanover\r\ngained the mouths of the Elbe and Weser; Prussia, the mouth of the Oder\r\nand the important city of Stettin. Augustus was restored to the Polish\r\nthrone, though without territorial gain. Great Britain, Denmark, and\r\nPrussia became the principal commercial heirs of Sweden.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treaty of Nystad (1721): Russia on the Baltic]\r\n[Sidenote: Petrograd]\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Nystad (1721) was the turning point for Russia, for\r\nthereby she acquired from Sweden full sovereignty over not only Karelia\r\nand Ingria but the important Baltic provinces of Esthonia and Livonia\r\nand a narrow strip of southern Finland including the strong fortress of\r\nViborg. Peter the Great had realized his ambition of affording his\r\ncountry a \"window to the west.\" On the waste marshes of the Neva he\r\nsucceeded with enormous effort and sacrifice of life in building a\r\ngreat city which might be a center of commerce and a bond of connection\r\nbetween Russia and the western world. He named his new city St.\r\nPetersburg [Footnote: Known generally in the Teutonic form \"St.\r\nPetersburg\" from its foundation until the War of the Nations in 1914,\r\nwhen the Slavic form of \"Petrograd\" was substituted.] and to it he\r\ntransferred his government from Moscow. Russia supplanted Sweden in the\r\nleadership of the Baltic and assumed a place among the Powers of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nPeter the Great did not realize his other ambition of securing a\r\nRussian port on the Black Sea. Although he captured and held Azov for a\r\ntime, he was obliged to relinquish it, as we have seen, in order to\r\nprevent the Turks from joining hands with Charles XII.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Peter the Great]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when Peter died in 1725, he left his empire a compact\r\nstate, well-organized, and well-administered, westernized at least\r\nsuperficially, and ready to play a conspicuous role in the\r\ninternational politics of Europe. The man who succeeded in doing all\r\nthese things has been variously estimated. By some he has been\r\nrepresented as a monster of cruelty and a murderer, [Footnote: Peter\r\nhad his son and heir, the Grand Duke Alexius, put to death because he\r\ndid not sympathize with his reforms. The tsar's other punishments often\r\nassumed a most revolting and disgusting character.] by others as a\r\ndemon of the grossest sensuality, by still others as a great national\r\nhero. Probably he merited all such opinions. But, above all, he was a\r\ngenius of fierce energy and will, who toiled always for what he\r\nconsidered to be the welfare of his country.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATHERINE THE GREAT: THE DEFEAT OF TURKEY AND THE DISMEMBERMENT OF\r\nPOLAND\r\n\r\nIt is hardly possible to feel much respect for the character of the\r\nRussian rulers who succeeded Peter the Great in the eighteenth century.\r\nMost of them were women with loose morals and ugly manners. But they\r\nhad little to fear from Sweden, which, utterly exhausted, was now on a\r\nsteady decline; and domestic difficulties both in Poland and in Turkey\r\nremoved any apprehension of attacks from those countries. In policies\r\nof internal government, Peter had blazed a trail so clear and\r\nunmistakable that one would have difficulty in losing it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of the Tsarina Catherine II]\r\n\r\nOf those female sovereigns of the Russian Empire, the most notable was\r\nCatherine II, usually called Catherine the Great (1762-1796). By birth\r\nshe was not even a Russian, but a princess of Protestant Germany, whom\r\ndynastic considerations made the wife of the heir to the Russian crown.\r\n[Footnote: The marriage was arranged by Frederick the Great in order to\r\nminimize Austrian influence at Petrograd.]\r\n\r\nNo sooner was she in her adopted country than she set to work to\r\ningratiate herself with its people. She learned the Russian language.\r\nShe outwardly conformed to the Orthodox Church. She slighted her German\r\nrelatives and surrounded herself with Russians. She established a\r\nreputation for quick wit and lofty patriotism. So great was her success\r\nthat when her half-insane husband ascended the throne as Peter III in\r\n1762, the people looked to her rather than to him as the real ruler,\r\nand before the year was over she had managed to make away with him and\r\nto become sovereign in name as well as in fact. For thirty-four years\r\nCatherine was tsarina of Russia. Immoral to the last, without\r\nconscience or scruple, she ruled the country with a firm hand and\r\nconsummated the work of Peter the Great.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Her Administration]\r\n\r\nIn the administrative system Catherine introduced the \"governments\" and\r\n\"districts,\" divisions and subdivisions of Russia, over which were\r\nplaced respectively governors and vice-governors, all appointed by the\r\ncentral authority. To the ecclesiastical alterations of Peter, she\r\nadded the secularization of church property, thereby making the clergy\r\ndistinctly dependent upon her bounty and strengthening the autocracy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Her Patronage of Learning]\r\n\r\nThe tsarina had some personal interest in the literary and scientific\r\nprogress of the eighteenth century and was determined to make Russia\r\nappear cultured in the eyes of western Europe. She corresponded with\r\nVoltaire and many other philosophers and learned men of the time. She\r\npensioned Diderot, the author of the great Encyclopædia, and invited\r\nscholars to her court. She posed as the friend of higher education.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Her Foreign Policy]\r\n\r\nOf the three foreign countries which in the eighteenth century blocked\r\nthe western expansion of Russia, Sweden had been humbled by Peter in\r\nthe Great Northern War and the treaty of Nystad. Poland and Turkey\r\nremained to be dealt with by Catherine the Great. Let us see what had\r\nlately transpired to render this task comparatively easy for the\r\ntsarina.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Poland in the Eighteenth Century]\r\n\r\nPoland in the first half of the eighteenth century was geographically a\r\nlarge state, but a variety of circumstances contributed to render it\r\nweak and unstable. In the first place, it was without natural\r\nboundaries or adequate means of defense. To the west it was separated\r\nfrom Prussia and Austria by an artificial line drawn through level\r\nplains or over low-lying hills. To the south a fluctuating frontier,\r\nfixed usually along the Dniester River, set it off from the Ottoman\r\nEmpire. The fertile valleys of the Dnieper, to the east, and of the\r\nDona, to the north, were shared by Russia and Poland. No chains of\r\nmountains and no strongly fortified places protected the Polish people\r\nfrom Germans, Turks, or Russians.\r\n\r\nNor was this wide, but indefensible, territory inhabited by a single\r\nhomogeneous people. The Poles themselves, centering in the western\r\ncities of Warsaw and Cracow, constituted a majority of the population,\r\nbut the Lithuanians, a kindred Slavic folk, covered the east-central\r\npart of the kingdom and a large number of Cossacks and \"Little\r\nRussians\" [Footnote: Ruthenians.] lived in the extreme east, while\r\nalong the northern and western borders were settlements of Germans and\r\nSwedes. Between the Poles and the Lithuanians existed a long-standing\r\nfeud, and the Germans regarded all the Slavs with ill-disguised\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\nReligion added its share to the dissension created by race and language\r\nwithin Poland. The Poles and most of the Lithuanians were stanch Roman\r\nCatholics. Other Lithuanians--especially the great nobles--together\r\nwith the Russians and Cossacks adhered to the Greek Orthodox faith,\r\nwhile Lutheran Protestantism was upheld by the western settlements of\r\nSwedes and Germans. The Dissenters, as the Orthodox and Protestants\r\nwere called, demanded from the Catholic majority a toleration and a\r\nfreedom of worship which at that time existed in no other country of\r\nEurope. When it was not forthcoming, they appealed to foreign Powers--\r\nthe Lutherans to Prussia, the Orthodox to Russia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wretched Social Conditions in Poland]\r\n\r\nWorst of all were the social conditions in Poland. By the eighteenth\r\ncentury, the towns had sunk into relative insignificance, leaving\r\nPoland without a numerous or wealthy middle class. Of the other\r\nclasses, the great nobles or magnates owned the land, lived in luxury,\r\nselfishly looked out for their own interests, and jealously played\r\npolitics, while the mass of the nation were degraded into a state of\r\nserfdom and wretchedness that would be difficult to parallel elsewhere\r\nin Europe. With a grasping, haughty nobility on one hand, and an\r\noppressed, ignorant peasantry on the other, social solidarity, the best\r\nguarantee of political independence, was entirely lacking.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Weakness of Polish Political Institutions]\r\n\r\nAn enlightened progressive government might have done something to\r\nremedy the social ills, but of all governments that the world has ever\r\nseen, the most ineffectual and pernicious was the Polish. Since the\r\nsixteenth century, the monarchy had been elective, with the result that\r\nthe reign of every sovereign was disfigured by foreign intrigues and\r\ndomestic squabbles over the choice of his successor, and also that the\r\nnoble electors were able not only to secure liberal bribes but to wring\r\nfrom the elect such concessions as gradually reduced the kingship to an\r\nornamental figurehead. Most of the later kings were foreigners who used\r\nwhat little power was left to them in furtherance of their native\r\ninterests rather than of the welfare of Poland. Thus the kings in the\r\nfirst half of the eighteenth century were German electors of Saxony,\r\nwho owed their new position to the interested friendship of Austria,\r\nPrussia, or Russia, and to the large sums of money which they lavished\r\nupon the Polish magnates; these same Saxon rulers cheerfully applied\r\nthe Polish resources to their German policies.\r\n\r\nAnother absurdity of the Polish constitution was the famous \"_liberum\r\nveto_,\" a kind of gentlemen's agreement among the magnates, whereby\r\nno law whatsoever could be enacted by the Diet if a single member felt\r\nit was prejudicial to his interests, and objected. In the course of the\r\nseventeenth century the principle of the _liberum veto_ had been\r\nso far extended as to recognize the lawful right of any one of the ten\r\nthousand noblemen of Poland to refuse to obey a law which he had not\r\napproved. This amounted to anarchism. And anarchism, however beautiful\r\nit might appear as an ideal, was hardly a trustworthy weapon with which\r\nto oppose the greedy, hard-hearted, despotic monarchs who governed all\r\nthe surrounding countries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Steady Decline of Ottoman Power during Seventeenth Century]\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Empire was not in such sore straits as Poland, but its\r\npower and prestige were obviously waning. In another place we have\r\nreviewed the achievements of the Turks in the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies--how they overran the Balkan peninsula, captured\r\nConstantinople, put an end to the ancient Græco-Roman Empire and under\r\nSuleiman the Magnificent extended their conquests along the northern\r\ncoast of Africa and in Europe across the Danube into the very heart of\r\nHungary. Although the sea-power of the Turks suffered a serious reverse\r\nat Lepanto (1571), their continued land advances provoked in\r\nChristendom the liveliest apprehension throughout the seventeenth\r\ncentury. After a twenty-five-years conflict they took Crete from\r\nVenice. They subjugated to their dominion the Tatars and Russians\r\nimmediately north of the Black Sea. They exacted homage from the\r\nprinces of Rumania and Transylvania. They annexed Hungary. For a time\r\nthey received tribute from the king of Poland. In 1683 they laid siege\r\nto the city of Vienna and would have taken it had not the patriotic\r\nPolish monarch, John Sobieski, brought timely aid to the beleaguered\r\nAustrians. That was the high-water mark of the Mohammedan advance in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThenceforth the Turkish boundaries gradually receded. An alliance of\r\nVenice, Poland, the pope, and Austria waged long and arduous warfare\r\nwith the Ottomans, and the resulting treaty of Karlowitz, signed at the\r\nvery close of the seventeenth century, gave the greater part of\r\nHungary, including Transylvania, to the Austrian Habsburgs, extended\r\nthe southern boundary of Poland to the Dniester River, and surrendered\r\nimportant trading centers on the Dalmatian and Greek coasts to the\r\nVenetians. Two subsequent wars between the sultan and the Habsburgs\r\ndefinitely freed the whole of Hungary from the Ottoman yoke.  The\r\nreasons for the wane of Turkey's power are scarcely to be sought in the\r\ninherent strength of her neighbors, for, with the possible exception of\r\nAustria and Russia, they were notoriously weak and had seldom been able\r\nor willing to work together in behalf of any common cause. The real\r\nreasons lay rather in the character and nature of the Turkish power\r\nitself. Domestic, not foreign, difficulties prepared the way for future\r\ndisasters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nature of the Turkish Conquests]\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that the Turks never constituted a majority\r\nof the population of their European possessions. They were a mere body\r\nof conquerors, who in frenzies of religious or martial enthusiasm,\r\ninspired with the idea that Divine Providence was using them as agents\r\nfor the spread of Mohammedanism, had fought valiantly with the sword or\r\ncunningly taken advantage of their enemies' quarrels to plant over wide\r\nareas the crescent in place of the cross. In the conquered regions, the\r\nnative Christian peoples were reduced to serfdom, and the Turkish\r\nconquerors became great landholders and the official class. To extend,\r\neven to maintain, such an artificial order of things, the Turks would\r\nbe obliged to keep their military organization always at the highest\r\npitch of excellence and to preserve their government from weakness and\r\ncorruption. In neither of these respects did the Turks ultimately\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Corruption In the Turkish Government]\r\n\r\nThe sultans of the eighteenth century were not of the stuff of which a\r\nSuleiman the Magnificent had been made. To the grim risks of battle\r\nthey preferred the cushioned ease of the palace, and all their powers\r\nof administration and government were quite consumed in the management\r\nof the household and the harem. Actual authority was gradually\r\ntransferred to the Divan, or board of ministers, whose appointments or\r\ndismissals were the results of palace intrigues, sometimes petty but\r\nmore often bloody. Corruption ate its way through the entire office-\r\nholding element of the Ottoman state: positions were bought and sold\r\nfrom the Divan down to the obscure village, and office was held to\r\nexist primarily for financial profit and secondarily as a means of\r\noppressing the subject people.\r\n\r\nThe army, on which so much in the Turkish state depended, naturally\r\nreflected the demoralized condition of the government. While Peter the\r\nGreat was organizing a powerful army in Russia, and Frederick the Great\r\nwas perfecting the Prussian military machine, the Ottoman army steadily\r\ndeclined. It failed to keep pace with the development of tactics and of\r\nfirearms in western Europe, and fell behind the times. The all-\r\nprevalent corruption ruined its discipline, and its regularly organized\r\nportion--the \"janissaries\"--became the masters rather than the servants\r\nof the sultans and of the whole Turkish government.\r\n\r\nIt was the fortune of the Russian tsarina--Catherine the Great--to\r\nappreciate the real weakness of both Turkey and Poland and to turn her\r\nneighbors' distress to the profit of her own country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Catherine's Interference in Poland]\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Catherine secured the Russian crown and by her inactivity\r\npermitted Frederick the Great to bring the Seven Years' War to a\r\nsuccessful issue, than the death of Augustus III, elector of Saxony and\r\nking of Poland, gave her an opportunity to interfere in Polish affairs.\r\nShe was not content with the Saxon line which was more or less under\r\nAustrian influence, and, with the astute aid of Frederick, she induced\r\nthe Polish nobles to elect one of her own courtiers and favorites,\r\nStanislaus Poniatowski, who thus in 1764 became the last king of an\r\nindependent Poland.\r\n\r\nWith the accession of Stanislaus, the predominance of Russia was fully\r\nestablished in Poland. Russia entered into an execrable agreement with\r\nPrussia and Austria to uphold the anarchical constitution of the\r\nunhappy and victimized country. When patriotic Poles made efforts--as\r\nthey now frequently did--to reform their government, to abolish the\r\n_liberum veto_, and to strengthen the state, they found their\r\nattempts thwarted by the allies either by force of arms or by bribes of\r\nmoney. The racial animosities and the religious differences within\r\nPoland afforded sufficient pretexts for the intervention of the\r\nneighboring Powers, especially Prussia and Russia.\r\n\r\nA popular insurrection of Polish Catholics against the intolerable\r\nmeddling of foreigners was crushed by the troops of Catherine, with the\r\nsingle result that the Russians, in pursuing some fleeing insurgents\r\nacross the southern frontier, violated Turkish territory and\r\nprecipitated a war between the Ottoman Empire and Russia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Catherine's War with the Turks, 1768-1774]\r\n\r\nThis Turkish War lasted from 1768 to 1774. The Ottoman government was\r\nprofoundly alarmed by the Russian foreign policy, believing that the\r\nintrigues in Poland would end in the annexation of that state to Russia\r\nand the consequent upsetting of the balance of power in the East, and\r\nthat, Poland once being disposed of, the turn of Turkey would come\r\nnext. The Turks, moreover, were egged on by the French government,\r\nwhich, anxious also to preserve the balance of power and to defend the\r\nliberties of Poland, was too financially embarrassed itself to\r\nundertake a great war against Prussia and Russia.\r\n\r\nThis war between Russia and Turkey fully confirmed the belief that the\r\npower of the latter was waning. The Ottoman troops, badly armed and\r\nbadly led, suffered a series of reverses. The Russians again occupied\r\nAzov, which Peter the Great had been compelled to relinquish; they\r\noverran Moldavia and Wallachia; they seized Bucharest; and they seemed\r\nlikely to cross the Danube. Catherine went so far as to fan a revolt\r\namong the Greek subjects of the sultan.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treaty of Kuchuk Kainarji (1774): Russia on the Black Sea]\r\n\r\nAt length, in 1774, the treaty of Kuchuk Kainarji was concluded between\r\nthe belligerents. It was most important in marking the southern\r\nextension of Russia. By its provisions, (1) Turkey formally ceded Azov\r\nand adjacent territory to Russia and renounced sovereignty over all\r\nland north of the Black Sea; (2) Turkey recovered Wallachia, Moldavia,\r\nand Greece, on condition that they should be better governed; (3)\r\nRussia obtained the right of free navigation for her merchant ships in\r\nTurkish waters; and (4) Russia was recognized as the protector of\r\ncertain churches in the city of Constantinople.\r\n\r\nWithin a few years after the signature of the treaty of Kuchuk\r\nKainarji, Catherine established Russian control over the various Tatar\r\nprincipalities north of the Black Sea, whose sovereignty Turkey had\r\nrenounced, and by a supplementary agreement in 1792, the Dniester River\r\nwas fixed upon as the boundary between the Russian and Ottoman empires.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish policy of Catherine the Great bore three significant\r\nresults. In the first place, Russia acquired a natural boundary in\r\nsouthern Europe, and became the chief Power on the Black Sea, whence\r\nher ships might pass freely through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles\r\nout into the Mediterranean to trade with western Europe. Russia's\r\nsecond \"window to the west\" was gained. Then, in the second place,\r\nRussia was henceforth looked upon as the natural ally and friend of\r\noppressed nationalities within the Turkish Empire. Finally, the special\r\nclause conferring on Russia the protectorate of certain churches in\r\nConstantinople afforded her a pretext for a later claim to protect\r\nChristians throughout the Ottoman state and consequently to interfere\r\nincessantly in Turkish affairs. Since the treaty of Kuchuk Kainarji,\r\nTurkey has declined with ever-increasing rapidity, and Russia has\r\nbecome an eager candidate for a liberal share of the spoils.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Catherine and the Partition of Poland]\r\n[Sidenote: First Partition, 1772]\r\n\r\nEven while the Turkish War was in progress, Catherine the Great had not\r\nlost sight of her Polish policy. Frederick of Prussia had doubtless\r\nhoped that she would, in order that he might have a free rein to direct\r\na distribution of territory entirely satisfactory to himself and to\r\nPrussia But the wily tsarina was never so immersed in other matters\r\nthat she neglected Russian interests in Poland. In 1772, therefore, she\r\njoined with Frederick and with Maria Theresa of Austria in making the\r\nfirst partition of Poland. Russia took all the country which lay east\r\nof the Dona and Dnieper rivers. Prussia took West Prussia except the\r\ntown of Danzig. Austria took Galicia and the city of Cracow. In all,\r\nPoland was deprived of about a fourth of her territory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Second Partition, 1793]\r\n[Sidenote: Third and Last Partition, 1795]\r\n\r\nThe partition of 1772 sobered the Polish people and brought them to a\r\nfull realizing sense of the necessity of radical political reform. But\r\nthe shameful and hypocritical attitude of the neighboring sovereigns\r\ncontinued to render their every effort abortive. For another twenty-one\r\nyears the wretched country struggled on, a victim of selfish foreign\r\ntutelage. Although both Frederick and Maria Theresa died in the\r\ninterval, their successors proved themselves quite as willing to\r\ncoöperate with the implacable tsarina. In 1793 Russia and Prussia\r\neffected the second partition of Poland, and in 1795, following a last\r\ndesperate attempt of the Poles to establish a new government, they\r\nadmitted Austria to a share in the final dismemberment of the unhappy\r\ncountry. Desperately did the brave Kosciuszko try to stem the tide of\r\ninvasion which poured in from all sides. His few forces, in spite of\r\ngreat valor, were no match for the veteran allies, and the defense was\r\nvain. \"Freedom shrieked when Kosciuszko fell.\" King Stanislaus\r\nPoniatowski resigned his crown and betook himself to Petrograd. Poland\r\nceased to exist as an independent state.\r\n\r\nBy the partitions of 1793 and 1795, Austria obtained the upper valley\r\nof the Vistula, and Prussia the lower, including the city of Warsaw,\r\nwhile the rest--the major share--went to Russia. Little Russia\r\n(Ruthenia) and approximately all of Lithuania thus passed into the\r\nhands of the tsarina. Russia thenceforth bordered immediately on\r\nPrussia and Austria and became geographically a vital member of the\r\nEuropean family of nations.\r\n\r\nCatherine the Great survived the third and final partition of Poland\r\nbut a year, dying in 1796. If it can be said of Peter that he made\r\nRussia a European Power, it can be affirmed with equal truth that\r\nCatherine made Russia a Great Power. The eighteenth century had\r\nwitnessed a marvelous growth of Russia in Europe. She had acquired\r\nterritory and a capital on the Baltic. She had secured valuable ports\r\non the Black Sea. She had pushed her boundaries westward into the very\r\ncenter of the Continent.\r\n\r\nThe rise of Russia was at the expense of her neighbors. Sweden had\r\nsurrendered her eastern provinces and lost her control of the Baltic.\r\nTurkey had abandoned her monopoly of the shores and trade of the Black\r\nSea. Poland had disappeared from the map.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ROMANOV FAMILY: RUSSIAN SOVEREIGNS (1613-1915)]\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL READING\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF RUSSIA. Elementary sketches: J. H.

We\r\nhave sat with red-robed cardinals in council to exalt the monarch of\r\nFrance; we have witnessed the worldwide wars by which Great Britain won\r\nand lost vast imperial domains; we have followed the thundering march\r\nof Frederick's armies through the Germanies, wasted with war; but we\r\nhave been blind indeed if the glare of bright helmets and the glamour\r\nof courtly diplomacy have hidden from our eyes a phenomenon more\r\nmomentous than even the growth of Russia or the conquest of New France.\r\nIt is the rise of the bourgeoisie.\r\n\r\nDriven on by insatiable ambition, not content to be lords of the world\r\nof business, with ships and warehouses for castles and with clerks for\r\nretainers, the bourgeoisie have placed their lawyers in the royal\r\nservice, their learned men in the academies, their economists at the\r\nking's elbow, and with restless energy they push on to shape state and\r\nsociety to their own ends. In England they have already helped to\r\ndethrone kings and have secured some hold on Parliament, but on the\r\nContinent their power and place is less advanced.\r\n\r\nFor the eighteenth century is still the grand age of monarchs, who take\r\nLouis XIV as the pattern of princely power and pomp. \"Benevolent\r\ndespots\" they are, these monarchs meaning well to govern their people\r\nwith fatherly kindness. But their plans go wrong and their reforms fall\r\nflat, while the bourgeoisie become self-conscious and self-reliant, and\r\nrise up against the throne of the sixteenth Louis in France. It is the\r\nbourgeoisie that start the revolutionary cry of \"Liberty, Equality,\r\nFraternity,\" and it is this cry in the throats of the masses which\r\nsends terror to the hearts of nobles and kings. Desperately the old\r\norder--the old régime--defends itself. First France, then all Europe,\r\nis affected. Revolutionary wars convulse the Continent. Never had the\r\nworld witnessed wars so disastrous, so bloody.\r\n\r\nYet the triumph of the bourgeoisie is not assured. The Revolution has\r\nbeen but one battle in the long war between the rival aristocracies of\r\nbirth and of business--a war in which peasants and artisans now give\r\ntheir lives for illusory dreams of \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,\" now\r\nfight their feudal lords, and now turn on their pretended liberators,\r\nthe bourgeoisie. For already it begins to dawn on the dull masses that\r\n\"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\" are chiefly for their masters.\r\n\r\nThe old regime, its decay, the rise of the bourgeoisie, the\r\ndisappointment of the common people,--these are the bold landmarks on\r\nwhich the student must fix his attention, while in the following\r\nchapters we sketch the condition of Europe in the eighteenth century,\r\nand trace the course of the French Revolution, the career of Napoleon,\r\nand the restoration of \"law and order\" under Metternich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN SOCIETY IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Backwardness]\r\n\r\nIf some \"Rip Van Winkle\" of the sixteenth century could have slept for\r\ntwo centuries to awake in 1750, he would have found far less to marvel\r\nat in the common life of the people than would one of us. Much of the\r\nfarming, even of the weaving, buying, and selling, was done just as it\r\nhad been done centuries before; and the great changes that were to\r\nrevolutionize the life and work of the people were as yet hardly\r\ndreamed of. In fact, there was so much in common between the sixteenth\r\nand eighteenth centuries, that the reader who has already made himself\r\nfamiliar with the manor and the gild, as described in Chapter II, will\r\nfind himself quite at home in the \"old regime,\" as the order of things\r\nin the eighteenth century is now termed.\r\n\r\nOne might still see the countless little agricultural villages and\r\nmanor houses nestling among the hills or dotting the plains, surrounded\r\nby green fields and fringed with forest or wasteland. The simple\r\nvillagers still cultivated their strips in the common fields in the\r\ntime-honored way, working hard for meager returns. A third of the land\r\nstood idle every year; it often took a whole day merely to scratch the\r\nsurface of a single acre with the rude wooden plow then in use; cattle\r\nwere killed off in the autumn for want of good hay; fertilizers were\r\nonly crudely applied, if at all; many a humble peasant was content if\r\nhis bushel of seed brought him three bushels of grain, and was proud if\r\nhis fatted ox weighed over four hundred pounds, though a modern farmer\r\nwould grumble at results three or four times as good.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Gentlemen Farmers\" and \"Husbandry\"]\r\n[Sidenote: \"Rotation of Crops\"]\r\n\r\nThere were some enterprising and prosperous landowners who used newer\r\nand better methods, and even wrote books about \"husbandry,\" as\r\nagriculture was called. The Dutch, especially, learned to cultivate\r\ntheir narrow territory carefully, and from them English farmers\r\nlearned many secrets of tillage. They grew clover and \"artificial\r\ngrasses\"--such as rye--for their cattle, cultivated turnips for winter\r\nfodder, tilled the soil more thoroughly, used fertilizers more\r\ndiligently, and even learned how to shift their crops from field to\r\nfield according to a regular plan, so that the soil would not lose its\r\nfertility and would not have to be left idle or \"fallow\" every third\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Survival of Primitive Methods]\r\n\r\nThese new methods were all very fine for \"gentlemen farmers,\" but for\r\nthe average peasant the old \"open-field\" system was an effective\r\nbarrier to progress. He could not plant new crops on his strips in the\r\ngrain fields, for custom forbade it; he could not breed his cows\r\nscientifically, while they ran in with the rest of the village cattle.\r\nAt best he could only work hard and pray that his cows would not catch\r\ncontagion from the rest, and that the weeds from his neighbor's wheat-\r\npatch might not spread into his own, for between such patches there was\r\nneither wall nor fence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Survival of Serfdom]\r\n[Sidenote: Sorry Condition of the Peasantry]\r\n\r\nPrimitive methods were not the only survivals of manorial life. Actual\r\nserfdom still prevailed in most of the countries of Europe except\r\nFrance [Footnote: Even in France, some serfdom still survived.] and\r\nEngland, and even in these countries nominal freedom lifted the\r\npeasantry but little above the common lot. It is true, indeed, that\r\ncountless differences in the degree and conditions of servitude existed\r\nbetween Russians and Frenchmen, and even between peasants in the same\r\ncountry or village. The English or French plowman, perhaps, might not\r\nbe sold to fight for other countries like the Hessians, nor could he be\r\ncommanded to marry an undesired bride, as were of the tenants of a\r\nRussian nobleman. But in a general way we may say that all the peasants\r\nof Europe suffered from much the same causes. With no voice in making\r\nthe laws, they were liable to heavy fines or capital punishment for\r\nbreaking the laws. Their advice was not asked when taxes were levied or\r\napportioned, but upon them fell the heaviest burdens of the state.\r\n\r\nIt was vexatious to pay outrageous fees for the use of a lord's mill,\r\nbridge, oven, or wine-press, to be haled to court for an imaginary\r\noffense, or to be called from one's fields to war, or to work on the\r\nroads without pay. It was hard for the hungry serf to see the fat deer\r\nventuring into his very dooryard, and to remember that the master of\r\nthe mansion house was so fond of the chase that he would not allow his\r\ngame to be killed for food for vulgar plowmen.\r\n\r\nBut these and similar vexations sank into insignificance in comparison\r\nwith the burdens of the taxes paid to lord, to church, and to king. In\r\nevery country of Europe the peasants were taxed, directly or\r\nindirectly, for the support of the three pillars of the \"old regime.\"\r\nThe form of such taxation in England differed widely from that in\r\nHungary; in Sweden, from that in Spain. But beneath discrepancies of\r\nform, the system was essentially the same. Some idea of the triple\r\ntaxation that everywhere bore so heavily upon the peasantry may be\r\nobtained from a brief resume of the financial obligations of an\r\nordinary French peasant to his king, his Church, and his lord.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peasant Obligations to Landlord]\r\n\r\nTo the lord the serf owed often three days' labor a week, in addition\r\nto stated portions of grain and poultry. In place of servile work the\r\nfreeman paid a \"quit-rent,\" that is, a sum of money instead of the\r\nservices which were considered to accompany the occupation of land.\r\nDouble rent was paid on the death of the peasant, and, if the farm was\r\nsold, one-fifth of the price went to the lord. Sometimes, however, a\r\nfreeman held his land without quit-rent, but still had numerous\r\nobligations which had survived from medieval times, such as the annual\r\nsum paid for a \"military protection\" which he neither demanded nor\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peasant Obligation to Church]\r\n\r\nThe second obligation was to the church--the tithe or tenth, which\r\nusually amounted every year to a twelfth or a fifteenth of the gross\r\nproduce of the peasant's land.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peasant Obligations to King and State]\r\n\r\nHeaviest of all were the taxes levied by the king. The _taille_,\r\nor land tax, was the most important. The amount was not fixed, but was\r\nsupposed to be proportional to the value of the peasant's land and\r\ndwelling. In practice the tax-collectors often took as much as they\r\ncould get. and a shrewd peasant would let his house go to pieces and\r\npretend to be utterly destitute in order that the assessors might not\r\nincrease the valuation of his property.\r\n\r\nThe other direct taxes were the poll tax, _i.e._, a certain sum\r\nwhich everybody alike must pay, and the income tax, usually a twentieth\r\npart of the income. Finally, there were indirect taxes, such as the\r\nsalt _gabelle_. Thus, in certain provinces every person had to buy\r\nseven pounds of salt a year from the government salt-works at a price\r\nten times its real value. Road-making, too, was the duty of the\r\npeasant, and the _corvée_, or labor on roads, often took several\r\nweeks in a year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Burden of Taxation on Peasants]\r\n\r\nAll these burdens--dues to the lord, tithes to the church, taxes to the\r\nking--left the peasant but little for himself. It is so difficult to\r\nget exact figures that we can put no trust in the estimate of a famous\r\nwriter that dues, tithes, and taxes absorbed over four-fifths of the\r\nFrench peasant's produce: nevertheless, we may be sure that the burden\r\nwas very great. In a few favored districts of France and England\r\nfarmers were able to pay their taxes and still live comfortably. But\r\nelsewhere the misery of the people was such as can hardly be imagined.\r\nWith the best of harvests they could barely provide for their families,\r\nand a dry summer or long winter would bring them to want. There was\r\nonly the coarsest of bread--and little of that; meat was a luxury; and\r\ndelicacies were for the rich. We read how starving peasants in France\r\ntried to appease their hunger with roots and herbs, and in hard times\r\nsuccumbed by thousands to famine. One-roomed mud huts with leaky\r\nthatched roofs, bare and windowless, were good enough dwellings for\r\nthese tillers of the soil. In the dark corners of the dirt-floors\r\nlurked germs of pestilence and death. Fuel was expensive, and the\r\nbitter winter nights must have found many a peasant shivering\r\nsupperless on his bed of straw.\r\n\r\nTrue, the gloom of such conditions was relieved here and there by a\r\nprosperous village or a well-to-do peasant. But, speaking in a general\r\nway, the sufferings of the poorer European peasants and serfs can\r\nhardly be exaggerated. It was they who in large part had paid for the\r\nwars, theaters, palaces, and pleasures of the courts of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCE AND INDUSTRY IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Growth of Towns]\r\n\r\nLet us now turn our eyes from the country to the city, for in the towns\r\nare to be found the bourgeoisie, the class in which we are most\r\ninterested. The steady expansion of commerce and industry during the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries had been attended by a remarkable\r\ndevelopment of town life. Little villages had grown, until in 1787\r\nthere were 78 towns of over 10,000 inhabitants each. London, the\r\ngreatest city in Europe, had increased in population from about half a\r\nmillion in 1685 to over a million in 1800. Paris was at least half as\r\nlarge; Amsterdam was a great city; and several German towns like\r\nHamburg, Bremen, and Frankfort were important trading centers.\r\n\r\nThe towns had begun to lose some of their medieval characteristics.\r\nThey had spread out beyond their cramping walls; roomy streets and\r\npleasant squares made the newer sections more attractive. The old\r\nfortifications, no longer needed for protection, served now as\r\npromenades. City thoroughfares were kept cleaner, sometimes well paved\r\nwith cobbles; and at night the feeble but cheerful glow of oil street-\r\nlamps lessened the terrors of the belated burgher who had been at the\r\ntheater or listened to protracted debates at the great town hall.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Industry  Gild Regulation]\r\n\r\nThe life of the town was nourished by industry and commerce. Industry\r\nin the eighteenth century meant far more than baking bread, making\r\nclothes, cobbling shoes, and fashioning furniture for use in the town;\r\nit meant the production on a large scale of goods to sell in distant\r\nplaces,--cloth, clocks, shoes, beads, dishes, hats, buttons, and what\r\nnot. Many of these articles were still manufactured under the\r\nregulations of the old craft gilds. For although the gild system was\r\npretty well broken up in England, it still maintained its hold on the\r\nContinent. In France the division of crafts had become so complicated\r\nthat innumerable bickerings arose between cobblers' gilds and\r\nshoemakers' gilds, between watch-makers and clock-makers. In Germany\r\nconditions were worse. The gilds, now aristocratic and practically\r\nhereditary corporations, used their power to prevent all competition,\r\nto keep their apprentices and journeymen working for little or nothing,\r\nto insure high profits, and to prevent any technical improvements which\r\nmight conceivably injure them. \"A hatter who improved his wares by\r\nmixing silk with the wool was attacked by all the other hatters; the\r\ninventor of sheet lead was opposed by the plumbers; a man who had made\r\na success in print-cloths was forced to return to antiquated methods by\r\nthe dyers.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Government Regulation of Industry: Mercantilism]\r\n\r\nTo gild regulation was added government regulation. It will be\r\nremembered that many seventeenth-century statesmen had urged their\r\nkings to make laws for the greater prosperity of industry, and that\r\nColbert had given the classic expression in France to the mercantilist\r\nidea that wealth could be cultivated by regulating and encouraging\r\nmanufactures. In order that French dyers might acquire a reputation for\r\nthorough work, he issued over three hundred articles of instruction for\r\nthe better conduct of the dyeing business. In an age when unscrupulous\r\nEnglish merchants were hurting the market with poorly woven fabrics,\r\nFrench weavers were given careful orders about the quality of the\r\nthread, the breadth of the cloth, and the fineness of the weave. It is\r\nsaid that in 1787 the regulations for French manufactures filled eight\r\nvolumes in quarto; and other governments, while less thorough, were\r\nequally convinced of the wisdom of such a policy.\r\n\r\nThe mercantilist was not content with making rules for established\r\nindustries. In justice to him it should be explained that he was\r\nanxious to plant new trades. Privileges, titles of nobility, exemption\r\nfrom taxation, generous grants of money, and other favors were accorded\r\nto enterprising business men who undertook to introduce new branches of\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\nIn general, however, the efforts of such mercantilists as Colbert have\r\nbeen adversely criticized by economists. The regulations caused much\r\ninconvenience and loss to many manufacturers, and the privileges\r\ngranted to new enterprises often favored unstable and unsuitable\r\nindustries at the expense of more natural and valuable trades. It is\r\nimpossible to estimate the value to France of Colbert's pet industries,\r\nand equally impossible to see what would have happened had industry\r\nbeen allowed free rein. But we must not entirely condemn the system\r\nsimply because its faults are so obvious and its benefits so hard to\r\nascertain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Restrictions on Commerce]\r\n\r\nCommerce, like industry, was subject to restrictions and impeded by\r\nantiquated customs. Merchants traversing the country were hindered by\r\npoor roads; at frequent intervals they must pay toll before passing a\r\nknight's castle, a bridge, or a town gate. Customs duties were levied\r\non commerce between the provinces of a single kingdom. And the cost of\r\ntransportation was thus made so high that the price of a cask of wine\r\npassing from the Orléanais to Normandy--two provinces in northwestern\r\nFrance--increased twenty-fold.\r\n\r\nFrom our past study of the commercial and colonial wars of the\r\neighteenth century, especially those between France and Great Britain,\r\nwe have already learned that mercantilist ideas were still dominant in\r\nforeign commerce. We have noted the heavy protective tariffs which were\r\ndesigned to shut out foreign competition. We have discussed the\r\nNavigation Acts, by means of which England encouraged her ship-owners.\r\nWe have also mentioned the absorption, by specially chartered\r\ncompanies, of the profits of the lucrative European trade with the\r\nIndies. The East India Company, the Hudson's Bay Company, the Dutch\r\nEast India Company, and the French _Compagnie des Indes_ were but\r\na few famous examples of the chartered companies which still\r\npractically monopolized the trade of most non-European countries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Great Growth of Commerce]\r\n\r\nCustoms and companies may have been injurious in many respects, but\r\ncommerce grew out of all bounds. The New World gave furs, timber,\r\ntobacco, cotton, rice, sugar, rum, molasses, coffee, dyes, gold, and\r\nsilver, in return for negro slaves, manufactures, and Oriental wares;\r\nand the broad Atlantic highways were traversed by many hundreds of\r\nheavily laden ships. The spices, jewels, tea, and textiles of the Far\r\nEast made rich cargoes for well-built East Indiamen. Important, too,\r\nwas the traffic which occupied English and Dutch merchant fleets in the\r\nBaltic; and the flags of many nations were carried by traders coastwise\r\nalong all the shores of Europe. Great Britain at the opening of the\r\neighteenth century possessed a foreign commerce estimated at\r\n$60,000,000, and that of France was at least two-thirds as great.\r\nDuring the century the volume of commerce was probably more than\r\nquadrupled.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to realize the tremendous importance of this expansion\r\nof commerce and industry. It had erected colonial empires, caused wars,\r\nlured millions of peasants from their farms, and built populous cities.\r\nBut most important of all--it had given strength to the bourgeoisie.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rise of the Bourgeoisie]\r\n\r\nMerchants, bankers, wholesalers, rich gild-masters, and even less\r\nopulent shopkeepers, formed a distinct \"middle class,\" between the\r\nprivileged clergy and nobility on the one hand, and the oppressed\r\npeasant and artisan, or manual laborer, on the other. The middle class,\r\noften called by the French word _bourgeoisie_ because it dwelt in\r\ntowns or _bourgs_, was strongest in England, the foremost\r\ncommercial nation of Europe, was somewhat weaker in France, and very\r\nmuch weaker in less commercial countries, such as Germany, Austria, and\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nIf the bourgeoisie was all-powerful in the world of business, it was\r\ninfluential in other spheres. Lawyers came almost exclusively from\r\ncommercial families. Judges, local magistrates, keepers of prisons,\r\ngovernment secretaries, intendants, all the world of officialdom was\r\nthronged with scions of bourgeois families. The better and older\r\nmiddle-class families prided themselves on their wealth, influence, and\r\nculture. They read the latest books on science and philosophy; they\r\nsometimes criticized the religious ideas of the past; and they eagerly\r\ndiscussed questions of constitutional law and political economy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ambition of the Bourgeoisie]\r\n\r\nAmbition came quite naturally with wealth and learning. The bourgeoisie\r\nwanted power and privilege commensurate with their place in business\r\nand administration. It seemed unbearable that a foppish noble whose\r\nonly claims to respect were a moldy castle and a worm-eaten patent of\r\nnobility should everywhere take precedence over men of means and\r\nbrains. Why should the highest social distinctions, the richest\r\nsinecures, and the posts of greatest honor in the army and at court be\r\nclosed to men of ignoble birth, as if a man were any better for the\r\npossession of a high-sounding title?\r\n\r\nMoreover, the bourgeoisie desired a more direct say in politics. In\r\nEngland, to be sure, the sons of rich merchants were frequently\r\nadmitted to the nobility, and commercial interests were pretty well\r\nrepresented in Parliament. In France, however, the feudal nobility was\r\nmore arrogant and exclusive, and the government less in harmony with\r\nmiddle-class notions. The extravagant and wasteful administration of\r\nroyal money was censured by every good business man. It was argued that\r\nif France might only have bourgeois representation in a national\r\nparliament to regulate finance and to see that customs duties, trade-\r\nlaws, and foreign relations were managed in accordance with business\r\ninterests, then all would be well.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRIVILEGED CLASSES\r\n\r\nThus far, in analyzing social and economic conditions in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, we have concerned ourselves with the lowest class, the\r\npeasants and day laborers, and with the middle class or bourgeoisie--\r\nthe \"Third Estate\" of France and the \"Commons\" of Great Britain. All of\r\nthese were technically unprivileged or ignoble classes. The highest\r\nplace in society was reserved for the classes of the privileged, the\r\nclergy and the nobility, constituting the First and the Second Estates,\r\nrespectively. And it is to these that we must now direct our attention.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Small Number of \"Privileged\"]\r\n\r\nThe privileged classes formed a very small minority of the population.\r\nOf the 25,000,000 inhabitants of France, probably less than 150,000\r\nwere nobles and 130,000 clerics; about one out of every hundred of the\r\npeople was therefore privileged.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Large Number of \"Privileges\"]\r\n\r\nThis small upper class was distinguished from the common herd by rank,\r\npossessions, and privileges. The person of noble birth, _i.e._,\r\nthe son of a noble, was esteemed to be inherently finer and better than\r\nother men; so much so that he would disdain to marry a person of the\r\nlower class. He was addressed in terms of respect--\"my lord,\" \"your\r\nGrace\"; common men saluted him as their superior. His clothes were more\r\ngorgeous than those of the plain people; on his breast glittered the\r\nbadges of honorary societies, and his coach was proudly decorated with\r\nan ancestral coat of arms. His \"gentle\" birth admitted him to the\r\npolite society of the court and enabled him to seek preferment in\r\nchurch or army.\r\n\r\nMore substantial than marks of honor were the actual possessions of\r\nnobles and clergy. Each noble bequeathed to his eldest son a castle or\r\na mansion with more or less territory from which to collect rents or\r\nfeudal dues. Bishops, abbots, and archbishops received their office by\r\nelection or appointment rather than by inheritance, and, being\r\nunmarried, could not transmit their stations to children. But in\r\ncountries where the wealth of the Church had not been confiscated by\r\nProtestants, the \"prince of the Church\" often enjoyed during his\r\nlifetime magnificent possessions. The bishop of Strassburg had an\r\nannual income approximating 500,000 francs. Castles, cathedrals,\r\npalaces, rich vestments, invaluable pictures, golden chalices, rentals\r\nfrom broad lands, tithes from the people,--these were the property of\r\nthe clergy. It is estimated that the clergy and nobility each owned\r\none-fifth of France, and that one-third of all the land of Europe, one-\r\nhalf the revenue, and two-thirds the capital, were in the hands of\r\nChristian churches.\r\n\r\nThe noble families, possessing thousands of acres, and monopolizing the\r\nhigher offices of church and army, were further enriched, especially in\r\nFrance, by presents of money from the king, by pensions, by grants of\r\nmonopolies, and by high-salaried positions which entailed little or no\r\nwork. \"One young man was given a salary of $3600 for an office whose\r\nsole duty consisted in signing his name twice a year.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Exemption from Taxation]\r\n\r\nWith all their wealth the first two orders contributed almost nothing\r\nto lighten the financial burdens of the state. [Footnote: Exemption\r\nfrom taxation was often and similarly granted to bourgeois incumbents\r\nof government offices.] The Church in France claimed exemption from\r\ntaxation, but made annual gifts to the king of several hundred thousand\r\ndollars, though such grants represented less than one per cent of its\r\nincome. The nobles, too, considered the payment of direct taxes a\r\ndisgrace to their gentle blood, and did not hesitate by trickery to\r\nevade indirect taxation, leaving the chief burdens to fall upon the\r\nlower classes, and most of all upon the peasantry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Failure of the Privileged to Perform Real Services]\r\n[Sidenote: The Higher Nobility]\r\n\r\nAll these advantages, privileges, and immunities might be looked upon\r\nas a fitting reward which medieval Europe had given to her nobles for\r\nprotecting peaceable plowmen from the marauding bands then so common,\r\nand which she had bestowed upon her clergy for preserving education,\r\nfor encouraging agriculture, for fostering the arts, for tending the\r\npoor, the sick, and the traveler, and for performing the offices of\r\nreligion. But long before the eighteenth century the protective\r\nfunctions of feudal nobles had been transferred to the royal\r\ngovernment. No longer useful, the hereditary nobility was merely\r\nburdensome, and ornamental. Such as could afford it, spent their lives\r\nin the cities or at the royal court where they rarely did anything\r\nworth while, unless it were to invent an unusually delicate compliment\r\nor to fashion a flawless sonnet. Their morals were not of the best--it\r\nwas almost fashionable to be vicious--but their manners were perfect.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the landed estates of these absentee lords were in charge of\r\nflint-hearted agents, whose sole mission was to squeeze money from the\r\npeasants, to make them pay well for mill, bridge, and oven, to press to\r\nthe uttermost every claim which might give the absent master a larger\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Country Gentry]\r\n\r\nThe poorer noble, the \"country gentleman,\" was hardly able to live so\r\nextravagant a life, and accordingly remained at home, sometimes making\r\nfriends of the villagers, standing god-father to peasant-children, or\r\ninviting heavy-booted but light-hearted plowmen to dance in the castle\r\ncourtyard. But often his life was dull enough, with rents hard to\r\ncollect, and only hunting, drinking, and gossip to pass the time away.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Clergy]\r\n\r\nA similar and sharper contrast was observable between the higher and\r\nlower clergy, in England as well as in Roman Catholic countries. Very\r\nfrequently dissipated young nobles were nominated bishops or abbots:\r\nthey looked upon their office as a source of revenue, but never dreamed\r\nof discharging any spiritual duties. While a Cardinal de Rohan with\r\n2,500,000 livres a year astonished the court of France with his\r\nmagnificence and luxury, many a shabby but faithful country curate,\r\nwith an uncertain income of less than $150 a year, was doing his best\r\nto make both ends meet, with a little to spare for charity.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS AND ECCLESIASTICAL CONDITIONS IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Catholic Church]\r\n\r\nThe great ecclesiastical organization that had dominated the middle\r\nages was no longer the one church of Europe, but was still the most\r\nimpressive. Although the Protestant Revolt of the sixteenth century had\r\nestablished independent denominations in the countries of northern\r\nEurope, as we have seen in Chapter IV, Roman Catholic Christianity\r\nremained the state religion of Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, Austria,\r\nthe Austrian Netherlands, Bavaria, Poland, and several of the Swiss\r\nCantons. Moreover, large sections of the population of Ireland,\r\nBohemia, Hungary, Asia, and America professed Catholic Christianity.\r\n\r\nOrthodox Roman Catholics held fast to their faith in dogmas and\r\nsacraments and looked for spiritual guidance, correction, and comfort\r\nto the regular and secular clergy of their Church. The \"secular\"\r\nhierarchy of pope, cardinals, archbishops, bishops, priests, and\r\ndeacons, did not cease its pious labor \"in the world\"; nor was there\r\nlack of zealous souls willing to forego the pleasures of this world,\r\nthat they might live holier lives as monks, nuns, or begging friars,--\r\nthe \"regular\" clergy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relations of the Catholic Church with Lay States]\r\n\r\nIn its relations with lay states, the Roman Catholic Church had changed\r\nmore than in its internal organization. Many Protestant rulers now\r\nrecognized the pope merely as an Italian prince, [Footnote: The pope,\r\nit will be remembered, ruled the central part of Italy as a temporal\r\nprince.] and head of an undesirable religious sect--Roman Catholics\r\nwere either persecuted, or, as in Great Britain, deprived of political\r\nand civil rights. The Pope, on the other hand, could hardly regard as\r\nfriends those who had denied the spiritual mission and confiscated the\r\ntemporal possessions of the Church.\r\n\r\nIn Roman Catholic countries, too, the power of the pope had been\r\nlessened. The old dispute whether pope or king should control the\r\nappointment of bishops, abbots, and other high church officers had at\r\nlast been settled in favor of the king. The pope consented to recognize\r\nroyal appointees, provided they were \"godly and suitable\" men; in\r\nreturn he usually received a fee (\"annate\") from the newly appointed\r\nprelate. Other taxes the pope rarely ventured to levy; but good Roman\r\nCatholics continued to pay \"Peter's Pence\" as a free-will offering, and\r\nthe bishops occasionally taxed themselves for his benefit. In other\r\nways, also, the power of the Church was curtailed. Royal courts now\r\ntook cognizance of the greater part of those cases which had once been\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts;[Footnote: Blasphemy,\r\ncontempt of religion, and heresy were, however, still matters for\r\nchurch courts.]  the right of appeal to the Roman Curia was limited;\r\nand the lower clergy might be tried in civil courts. Finally, papal\r\nedicts were no longer published in a country without the sanction of\r\nthe king. These curtailments of papal privilege were doubtless\r\nimportant, but they meant little or nothing to the millions of peasants\r\nand humble workmen who heard Mass, were confessed, and received the\r\nsacraments as their fathers had done before them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Surviving Privileges of the Church]\r\n\r\nBesides their incalculable influence over the souls of men, the clergy\r\nwere an important factor in the civil life of Roman Catholic countries.\r\nEducation was mostly under their auspices; they conducted the hospitals\r\nand relieved the poor. Marriages were void unless solemnized in the\r\northodox manner, and, in the eye of the law, children born outside of\r\nChristian wedlock might not inherit property. Heretics who died\r\nunshriven, were denied the privilege of burial in Catholic cemeteries.\r\n\r\nOf the exemption of the clergy from taxation, and of the wealth of the\r\nChurch, we have already spoken, as well as of the high social rank of\r\nits prelates--a rank more in keeping with that of wealthy worldly\r\nnoblemen than with that of devout \"servants of the Lord.\" But we have\r\nyet to mention the influence of the Church in suppressing heresy.\r\n\r\nIn theory the Roman Catholic religion was still obligatory in Catholic\r\nstates. Uniformity of faith was still considered essential to political\r\nunity. Kings still promised at coronation faithfully to extirpate\r\nheretical sects. In Spain, during the first half of the eighteenth\r\ncentury hundreds of heretics were condemned by the Inquisition and\r\nburned at the stake; only toward the close of the century was there an\r\nabatement of religious intolerance. In France, King Louis XIV had\r\nrevoked the Edict of Nantes in 1685, and in the eighteenth century one\r\nmight have found laws on the French statute-books directing that men\r\nwho attended Protestant services should be made galley-slaves, that\r\nmedical aid should be withheld from impenitent heretics, and that\r\nwriters of irreligious books should suffer death. Such laws were very\r\npoorly enforced, however, and active religious persecution was dying\r\nout in France in the second half of the eighteenth century. But\r\ntoleration did not mean equality; full civil and political rights were\r\nstill denied the several hundred thousand Huguenots in France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Summary of Weaknesses in the Catholic Church]\r\n\r\nThe strength of the Roman Catholic Church in the eighteenth century was\r\nimpaired by four circumstances: (1) the existence of bitterly\r\nantagonistic Protestant sects; (2) the growth of royal power and of the\r\nsentiment of nationalism, at the expense of papal power and of\r\ninternationalism; (3) the indolence and worldliness of some of the\r\nprelates; and (4) the presence of internal dissensions. The first three\r\ncircumstances should be clear from what has already been said, but a\r\nword of explanation is necessary about the fourth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jansenism]\r\n\r\nThe first of these dissensions arose concerning the teachings of a\r\ncertain Flemish bishop by the name of Cornelius Janssen (1585-1638),\r\n[Footnote: Janssen is commonly cited by the Latin version of his name--\r\nJansenius.] whose followers, known as Jansenists, had possessed\r\nthemselves of a sort of hermitage and nunnery at Port-Royal in the\r\nvicinity of Paris. Jansenism found a number of earnest disciples and\r\nable exponents, whose educational work and reforming zeal brought them\r\ninto conflict with the Jesuits. The Jesuits accused the Jansenists of\r\nheresy, affirming that Janssen's doctrine of conversion-by-the-will-of-\r\nGod was in last analysis practically Calvin's predestination. For some\r\nyears the controversy raged. Blaise Pascal (1623-1662), a famous\r\nmathematician and experimenter in physics, defended the Jansenists\r\neloquently and learnedly, but Jesuits had the ear of Louis XIV and\r\nbroke up the little colony at Port-Royal. Four years later the pope\r\nissued a famous bull, called \"Unigenitus\" (1713), definitively\r\ncondemning Jansenist doctrines as heretical; but the sect still lived\r\non, especially in Holland, and \"Unigenitus\" was disliked by many\r\northodox Roman Catholics, who thought its condemnations too sweeping\r\nand too severe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Febronianism]\r\n\r\nA second dispute, questioning the authority of the papacy, centered in\r\na German theologian [Footnote: Johann Nikolaus von Hoatheim, auxiliary\r\nbishop of Trier. His famous work was published in 1763.] who wrote\r\nunder the Latin name of Febronius. Febronianism was an attempted\r\nrevival of the conciliar movement of the fifteenth century and closely\r\nresembled \"Gallicanism,\" as the movement in favor of the \"Liberties of\r\nthe Gallican Church\" was called. These \"Liberties\" had been formulated\r\nin a French declaration of 1682 and involved two major claims: (1) that\r\nthe pope had no right to depose or otherwise to interfere with temporal\r\nmonarchs, and (2) that in spiritual affairs the general council of\r\nbishops (cumenical council) was superior to the sovereign pontiff.\r\nThis twofold movement towards nationalism and representative church\r\ngovernment was most strongly controverted by the Jesuits, who took\r\ntheir stand on the assertion that the pope was supreme in all things.\r\nBy the opponents of the Jesuits, this looking \"beyond the mountains\" to\r\nthe Roman Curia for ultimate authority was called Ultramontanism\r\n(beyond-the-mountainism). In almost every Catholic country of Europe\r\nthe struggle between Ultramontanism and Febronianism aroused\r\ncontroversy, and the nature of papal supremacy remained a mooted point\r\nwell into the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Suppression of the Jesuit Order]\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the eighteenth century Ultramontanism received a\r\nserious though temporary setback by the suppression of the Jesuits\r\n(1773). For over two centuries members of the Society of Jesus had been\r\nfamed as schoolmasters, preachers, controversialists, and missionaries;\r\nbut in the eighteenth century the order became increasingly involved in\r\ntemporal business; its power and wealth were abused; its political\r\nentanglements incurred the resentment of reforming royal ministers; and\r\nsome of its missionaries became scandalously lax in their doctrines.\r\nThe result was the suppression of the order, first in Portugal (1759),\r\nthen in other countries, and finally altogether by a papal decree of\r\n1773. [Footnote: In Russia, where the order of suppression was not\r\nenforced, the Jesuits kept their corporate organization. Subsequently,\r\non 7 August, 1814, the entire society was restored by papal bull, and\r\nis now in a flourishing condition in many countries.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Anglican Church]\r\n\r\nWe shall next consider the Anglican Church, whose complete independence\r\nfrom the papacy, it will be remembered, was established by Henry VIII\r\nof England, and whose doctrinal position had been defined in the\r\nThirty-nine Articles of Elizabeth's reign. It was the state Church of\r\nEngland, Ireland, and Wales, and had scattering adherents in Scotland\r\nand in the British colonies. Like the Roman Catholic Church in France,\r\nthe Anglican Church enjoyed in the British Isles, excepting Scotland,\r\nspecial privileges, great wealth, and the collection of tithes from\r\nAnglicans and non-Anglicans alike. It was intensely national,\r\nindependent of papal control or other foreign influence, and patriotic\r\nin spirit. It retained a hierarchical government similar to that of the\r\nRoman Catholics. As in France, the bishops were inclined to use the\r\nemoluments without doing the work of their office, while the country\r\ncurates were very poor.\r\n\r\nIn its relations with others, the Anglican Church was not very liberal.\r\nIn England, Protestant (Calvinistic) Dissenters had been granted\r\nliberty of worship in 1689 (Toleration Act) but still they might not\r\nhold civil, military, or political office without the special\r\ndispensation of Parliament. Baptism, registration of births and deaths,\r\nand marriage could be performed legally only by Anglican clergymen.\r\nNon-Anglicans were barred from Oxford and could take no degree at\r\nCambridge University.\r\n\r\nWorst of all was the lot of the Roman Catholics. In England they had\r\npractically no civil, political, or religious rights. By a law of 1700\r\n[Footnote: Repealed in 1778, but on condition that Roman Catholics\r\nshould deny the temporal power of the pope and his right to depose\r\nkings.] the Roman Catholic must abjure the Mass or lose his property,\r\nand priests celebrating Mass were liable to life imprisonment. In\r\nIreland the communicants of the \"Church of Ireland\" (Anglican)\r\nconstituted a very small minority, [Footnote: Even in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, there were only about 500,000 Anglicans out of a population of\r\nsomewhat less than 6,000,000.] while the native Roman Catholics,\r\ncomprising over four-fifths of the population, were not only seriously\r\nhindered from exercising their own religion, not only deprived of their\r\npolitical rights, not only made subservient to the economic interests\r\nof the Protestants, but actually forced to pay the tithe to support\r\nEnglish bishops and curates, who too often lived in England, since\r\ntheir parishioners were all Roman Catholics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Protestant Sects in England: Baptists]\r\n\r\nThe Dissenters from the Anglican Church embraced many different creeds.\r\nWe have already spoken of the Calvinistic Presbyterians and\r\nSeparatists. Besides these, several new sects had appeared. The Baptist\r\nChurch was a seventeenth-century off-shoot of Separatism. To\r\nCalvinistic theology and Congregational Church government, the Baptists\r\nhad added a belief in adult baptism, immersion, and religious liberty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Unitarians]\r\n\r\nA group of persons who denied the divinity of Christ, thereby departing\r\nwidely from usual Protestantism as well as from traditional\r\nCatholicism, came into some prominence in the eighteenth century\r\nthrough secessions from the Anglican Church and through the preaching\r\nof the scientist Joseph Priestley, and gradually assumed the name of\r\nUnitarians. It was not until 1844 that the sect obtained complete\r\nreligious liberty in England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Quakers]\r\n\r\nA most remarkable departure from conventional forms was made under the\r\nleadership of George Fox, the son of a weaver, whose followers, loosely\r\norganized as the Society of Friends, were often derisively called\r\nQuakers, because they insisted that true religion was accompanied by\r\ndeep emotions and quakings of spirit. Although severely persecuted,\r\n[Footnote: In 1685 as many as 1460 Quakers lay in English prisons.] the\r\nQuakers grew to be influential at home, and in the colonies, where they\r\nfounded Pennsylvania (1681). Their refusal to take oaths, their quaint\r\n\"thee\" and \"thou,\" their simple and somber costumes, and their habit of\r\nsitting silent in religious meeting until the spirit should move a\r\nmember to speak, made them a most picturesque body. Professional\r\nministers and the ceremonial observance of Baptism and the Lord's\r\nSupper, they held to be forms destructive of spontaneous religion. War,\r\nthey said, gave free rein to un-Christian cruelty, selfishness, and\r\ngreed; and, therefore, they would not fight. They were also vigorous\r\nopponents of negro slavery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Methodists]\r\n\r\nThe Methodist movement did not come until the eighteenth century. By\r\nthe year 1740, a group of earnest Oxford students had won the nickname\r\nof \"Methodists\" by their abstinence from frivolous amusements and their\r\nmethodical cultivation of fervor, piety, and charity. Their leader,\r\nJohn Wesley (1703-1791), was a man of remarkable energy, rising at four\r\nin the morning, filling every moment with work, living frugally on £28\r\na year, visiting prisons, and exhorting his companions to piety. The\r\nMethodist leaders were very devout and orthodox Anglicans, but they\r\nwere so anxious \"to spread Scriptural Holiness over the land\" that they\r\npreached in open fields as well as in churches. Wesley and other great\r\norators appealed to the emotions of thousands of miners, prisoners, and\r\nignorant weavers, and often moved them to tears. It is said that John\r\nWesley preached more than 40,000 sermons.\r\n\r\nThe Methodist preachers gradually became estranged from the Anglican\r\nChurch, established themselves as a new dissenting sect, and dropped\r\nmuch of the Anglican ritual. The influence of their preaching was very\r\nmarked, however, and many orthodox Anglican clergymen traveled about\r\npreaching to the lower classes. This \"evangelical movement\" is\r\nsignificant because it showed that a new class of industrial workers\r\nhad grown up without benefit of the church or protection of the state.\r\nWe shall subsequently hear more of them in connection with the events\r\nof the Industrial Revolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lutheran Churches on the Continent]\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century, Lutheranism was the state religion of\r\nDenmark (including Norway), Sweden, and of several German states,\r\nnotably Prussia, Saxony, and Brunswick. The Lutheran churches retained\r\nmuch of the old ritual and episcopal government. Ecclesiastical lands,\r\nhowever, had been secularized, and Lutheran pastors were supported by\r\nfree-will offerings and state subventions. In Prussia, [Footnote:\r\nLater, in 1817, the Lutherans and Calvinists of Prussia were brought\r\ntogether, under royal pressure, to form the \"Evangelical Church.\"\r\nAccording to the king, this was not a fusion of the two Protestant\r\nfaiths, but merely an external union.]  Denmark, and Sweden the church\r\nrecognized the king as its _summus episcopus_ or supreme head.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reformed Churches]\r\n\r\nZwinglian and Calvinistic churches were usually called \"Reformed\" or\r\n\"Presbyterian\" and represented a more radical deviation than\r\nLutheranism from Roman Catholic theology and ritual, holding the Lord's\r\nSupper to be but a commemorative ceremony, doing away with altar-\r\nlights, crucifixes, and set prayers, and governing themselves by synods\r\nof priests or presbyters. In the eighteenth century Presbyterianism was\r\nstill the established religion of Scotland, and of the Dutch\r\nNetherlands. In France the Huguenots, in Switzerland the French-\r\nspeaking Calvinists and German-speaking Zwinglians, and numerous\r\ncongregations in southern Germany still represented the Reformed Church\r\nof Calvin and Zwingli. [Footnote: For the Orthodox Church in Russia,\r\nsee above, pp. 122, 372, 380. Some reforms in the ritual had been\r\nintroduced by a certain Nikon, a patriarch of the seventeenth century.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Growth of Skepticism. Deism]\r\n\r\nOne of the most noteworthy features of the eighteenth century was the\r\nappearance of a large number of doubters of Christianity. In the\r\ncomparatively long history of the Christian Church, there had often\r\nbeen reformers, who attacked specific doctrines or abuses, but never\r\nbefore, with the possible exception of Italian humanists of the\r\nfifteenth century, [Footnote: See above, pp. 124, 182 ff.] had there\r\nbeen such a considerable and influential number who ventured to assail\r\nthe very foundations of the Christian belief. During the last quarter\r\nof the seventeenth century, a number of English philosophers, imbued\r\nwith enthusiasm for the discovery of scientific laws, went on to apply\r\nthe newer scientific methods to religion. They claimed that the Bible\r\nwas untrustworthy, that the dogmas and ceremonies of the churches were\r\nuseless if not actually harmful, and that true religion was quite\r\nnatural in man and independent of miraculous revelation. God, they\r\nasserted, had created the universe and established laws for it. He\r\nwould not upset these laws to answer the foolish prayers of a puny\r\nhuman being. Men served God best by discounting miracles, discrediting\r\n\"superstition,\" and living in accordance with natural law. Just what\r\nthis law was, they left largely to the common sense of each man to\r\ndetermine. As a result, the positive side of Deism, as the body of the\r\nnew teachings was called, was lost in vagueness, and the negative side\r\n--the mere denial of orthodox Christianity--became uppermost in men's\r\nminds.\r\n\r\nDeism was important in several ways, especially for France, whence it\r\nwas carried from England. (1) For a large part of the most intelligent\r\nand influential classes, it _destroyed reverence_ for the Church,\r\nand prepared the way for the religious experiments of the French\r\nRevolution. (2) It gave an impetus to _philosophers_ who evolved\r\ngreat systems and exhibited wonderful ingenuity and confidence in\r\nformulating laws which would explain the why, what, whence, and whither\r\nof human life. (3) While casting doubt on the efficacy of particular\r\nreligions, it demanded _toleration_ for all. (4) Finally, it was\r\nresponsible for a great increase of _indifference_ to religion.\r\nPeople too lazy or too ignorant to understand the philosophic basis of\r\nDeism, used the arguments of Deists in justification of their contempt\r\nfor religion, and to many people disbelief and intelligence seemed to\r\nbe synonymous. We have considered Deism here for its significant\r\nbearing on the religious situation in the eighteenth century. In the\r\nfollowing section we shall see how it was part and parcel of the\r\nscientific and intellectual spirit of the times.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC AND INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Art]\r\n\r\nAs we have observed in an earlier chapter, both science and art\r\nflowered in the sixteenth century. The great men of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, however, devoted themselves almost exclusively to science; and\r\nthe artists of the time were too insincere, too intent upon pleasing\r\nshallow-brained and frivolous courtiers, to produce much that was worth\r\nwhile. Great numbers of plays were written, it is true, but they were\r\nhopelessly dull imitations of classic models. Imitative and uninspired\r\nlikewise were statues and paintings and poems. One merit they\r\npossessed. If a French painter lacked force and originality, he could\r\nat least portray with elegance and charm a group of fine ladies angling\r\nin an artificial pool. Elegance, indeed, redeemed the eighteenth\r\ncentury from imitative dullness and stupid ostentation: elegance\r\nexpressed more often in perfumes, laces, and mahogany than in paint or\r\nmarble. The silk-stockinged courtier accompanying his exquisitely\r\nperfect bow with a nicely worded compliment was surely as much an\r\nartist as the sculptor. Nor can one help feeling that the chairs of\r\nLouis XV were made not to sit in, but to admire; for their curving\r\nmahogany legs look too slenderly delicate, their carved and gilded\r\nbacks too uncomfortable, for mere use. Chairs and fine gentlemen were\r\nalike useless, and alike elegant.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The New Science]\r\n\r\nMore substantial were the achievements of eighteenth-century\r\nscientists. From philosophers of an earlier century--Francis Bacon\r\n(1561-1626) and René Descartes (1596-1650)--they learned to question\r\neverything, to seek new knowledge by actual experiment, to think\r\nboldly. You must not blindly believe in God, they said, you must first\r\nprove His existence. Or, if you will learn how the body is made, it\r\nwill not do to believe what Hippocrates or any other Greek authority\r\nsaid about it; you must cut rabbits open and see with your own eyes\r\nwhere heart and lungs are hidden beneath the coat of fur. Seeing and\r\nthinking for oneself were the twin principles of the new scientific\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Isaac Newton]\r\n\r\nThe new science found many able exponents in the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries, and of them all Sir Isaac Newton (1646-1727) was\r\nprobably the most illustrious. Coming from a humble family in a little\r\nEnglish village, Newton at an early age gave evidence of uncommon\r\nintelligence. At Cambridge University he astonished his professors and\r\nshowed such great skill in mathematics that he was given a professor's\r\nchair when only twenty-three years old.\r\n\r\nFor Descartes, Newton conceived great admiration, and, like Descartes,\r\nhe applied himself to experimentation as well as to formal mathematics.\r\nHis boyish ingenuity in the construction of windmills, kites, and\r\nwater-clocks was now turned to more serious ends. Like other scientists\r\nof the day, he experimented with chemicals in his laboratory, and tried\r\ndifferent combinations of lenses, prisms, and reflectors, until he was\r\nable to design a great telescope with which to observe the stars.\r\n\r\nHis greatest achievement was in astronomy. Galileo, Copernicus, and\r\nother investigators had already concluded that the earth is but one of\r\nmany similar bodies moving around the sun, which in turn is only one of\r\ncountless suns--for every star is a sun. Now Newton wondered what held\r\nthese mighty spheres in their places in space, for they appeared to\r\nmove in definite and well-regulated orbits without any visible support\r\nor prop. It is alleged that the answer to the problem was suggested by\r\nthe great philosopher's observation of a falling apple. The same\r\ninvisible force that made the apple fall to the ground must, he is said\r\nto have reasoned, control the moon, sun, and stars. The earth is pulled\r\ntoward the sun, as the apple to the earth, but it is also pulled toward\r\nthe stars, each of which is a sun so far away that it looks to us very\r\nsmall. The result is that the earth neither falls to the sun nor to any\r\none star, but moves around the sun in a regular path.\r\n\r\nThis suggestive principle by which every body in the universe is pulled\r\ntowards every other body, Newton called the law of universal\r\ngravitation. Newton's law [Footnote: It was really only a shrewd guess,\r\nbut it appears to work so well that we often call it a \"law.\"] was\r\nexpressed in a simple mathematical formula [Footnote: \"The force\r\nincreases directly in proportion to the product of the masses, and\r\ninversely in proportion to the square of the distance.\"] by means of\r\nwhich physics and astronomy were developed as mathematical sciences.\r\nWhen a modern astronomer foretells an eclipse of the sun or discusses\r\nthe course of a comet, or when a physicist informs us that he has\r\nweighed the earth, he is depending directly or indirectly upon Newton's\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Experimental and Applied Science]\r\n\r\nThe brilliance of Sir Isaac Newton's individual achievement should not\r\nobscure the fame of a host of other justly celebrated scientists and\r\ninventors. One of Newton's contemporaries, the German philosopher\r\nGottfried Wilhelm von Leibnitz (1646-1716), elaborated a new and\r\nvaluable branch of mathematics, the differential calculus, [Footnote:\r\nThe credit for this achievement was also claimed by Newton.] which has\r\nproved to be of immense service in modern engineering. At the same\r\ntime, the first experiments were being made with the mysterious\r\npotencies of electricity: the electrical researches of Benjamin\r\nFranklin (1706-1790), his discovery that flashes of lightning are\r\nmerely electrical phenomena and his invention of the lightning rod are\r\ntoo familiar to need repeating; the work of Luigi Galvani (1737-1798)\r\nand of Count Alessandro Volta (1745-1827), two famous Italian\r\nphysicists, is less well known, but their labors contributed much to\r\nthe development of physical science, and their memory is perpetuated\r\nwhenever the modern electrician refers to a \"voltaic cell\" or when the\r\ntinsmith speaks of \"galvanized\" iron. In this same period, the first\r\nimportant advances were made in the construction of balloons, and the\r\nconquest of the air was begun. In the eighteenth century, moreover, the\r\nfoundations of modern chemistry were laid by Joseph Priestley (1733-\r\n1804), Antoine Laurent Lavoisier (1743-1794), and Henry Cavendish\r\n(1731-1810); oxygen was discovered, water was decomposed into its\r\nelements, and the nomenclature of modern chemistry had its inception.\r\nIn medicine and surgery, too, pioneer work was done by John Hunter\r\n(1728-1793), a noted Scotch surgeon and anatomist, and by the Swiss\r\nprofessor Albrecht von Haller (1708-1777), the \"father of modern\r\nphysiology\"; the facts which eighteenth-century physicians discovered\r\nregarding the circulation of the blood made possible more intelligent\r\nand more effective methods of treating disease; and just at the close\r\nof the eighteenth century, Edward Jenner (1749-1823), an English\r\nphysician, demonstrated that the dread disease of smallpox could be\r\nprevented by vaccination. Geographical knowledge was vastly extended by\r\nthe voyages of scientific explorers, like the English navigator Captain\r\nJames Cook [Footnote: The Captain Cook who discovered, or rediscovered,\r\nAustralia. See above, P. 340.] (1728-1779) and the French sailor Louis\r\nde Bougainville (1739-1811), in the hitherto uncharted expanses of the\r\nsouthern Pacific. Furthermore, since these explorers frequently brought\r\nhome specimens of unfamiliar tropical animals and plants, rich material\r\nwas provided for zoology and botany, which, thanks to the efforts of\r\nthe Frenchman Georges de Buffon (1707-1788) and of the Swede Carolus\r\nLinnaeus (1707-1778), were just becoming important sciences.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Popularity of the New Science]\r\n\r\nOne reason for the rapid development of natural science in the\r\neighteenth century was the unprecedented popularity and favor enjoyed\r\nby scientists. Kings granted large pensions to scientists; British\r\nministers bestowed remunerative offices, and petty princes showered\r\nvaluable gifts upon them. Pretentious observatories with ponderous\r\ntelescopes were built, often at public expense, in almost every country\r\nof Europe. Groups of learned men were everywhere banded together in\r\n\"academies\" or \"societies.\" The \"Royal Society\" of London, founded in\r\n1662, listened to reports of the latest achievements in mathematics,\r\nastronomy, and physics. The members of the _Académie française\r\n(French Academy) were granted pensions by Louis XIV and even reckoned\r\nNewton among their honorary members.\r\n\r\nNever before had there been such interest in science, and never before\r\nhad there been such opportunity to learn. Printing was now well\r\ndeveloped; the learned societies and observatories published reports of\r\nthe latest development in all branches of knowledge. Encyclopedias were\r\ngotten out professing to embody in one set of volumes the latest\r\ninformation relative to all the new sciences. Books were too expensive\r\nfor the common person, but not so for the bourgeoisie, nor for numerous\r\nnobles. Indeed, it became quite the fashion in society to be a\r\n\"savant,\" a scientist, a philosopher, to dabble in chemistry, perhaps\r\neven to have a little laboratory or a telescope, and to dazzle one's\r\nfriends with one's knowledge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Spirit of Progress and Reform]\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if the golden age was dawning: the human mind seemed to be\r\nawakening from the slumber of centuries to con the world, to unravel\r\nthe mysteries of life, and to discover the secrets of the universe.\r\nConfident that only a little thought would be necessary to free the\r\nworld from vice, ignorance, and superstition, thinkers now turned\r\nboldly to attack the vexing problems of religion and morality, to\r\ncriticize state, society, and church, and to point the way to a new and\r\nearthly paradise.\r\n\r\nThis tendency--this enthusiasm--has usually been styled \"rationalism\"\r\nbecause its champions sought to make everything _rational_ or\r\nreasonable. Its foremost representatives were to be found in Great\r\nBritain between 1675 and 1725. They wrote many books discussing\r\nabstruse problems of philosophy, which can have slight interest for us;\r\nbut certain ideas they had of very practical importance, ideas which\r\nprobably found their most notable expression in the writings of John\r\nLocke (1632-1704). Locke argued (1) that all government exists, or\r\nshould exist, by consent of the governed--by a \"social\" contract, as it\r\nwere; (2) that education should be more widespread; (3) that\r\nsuperstition and religious formalism should not be allowed to obscure\r\n\"natural laws\" and \"natural religion\"; and (4) that religious\r\ntoleration should be granted to all but atheists.\r\n\r\nThe ideas of these English philosophers were destined to exercise a far\r\ngreater influence upon France than upon England. They found delighted\r\nadmirers among the nobility, ardent disciples among the bourgeoisie,\r\nand eloquent apostles in Voltaire, Diderot, and Rousseau.\r\n\r\nWithout a doubt, the foremost figure in the intellectual world of the\r\neighteenth century was François Marie Arouet, or, as he called himself,\r\nFrançois M. A. de Voltaire (1694-1778). Even from his boyhood he had\r\nbeen a clever hand at turning verses, and had fully appreciated his own\r\ncleverness. His businesslike father did not enjoy the boy's poetry,\r\nespecially if it was written when young François should have been\r\nstudying law. But François had a mind of his own; he liked to show his\r\ncleverness in gay society and relished making witty rhymes about the\r\nfoibles of public ministers or the stupidity of the prince regent of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nHis sharp tongue and sarcastic pen were a source of constant danger to\r\nVoltaire. For libel the regent had him imprisoned a year in the\r\nBastille. Some years later he was beaten by the lackeys of an offended\r\nnobleman, again sent to the Bastille, and then exiled three years in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nAt times he was the idol of Paris, applauded by _philosophes_ and\r\npetted by the court, or again he would be a refugee from the wrath of\r\noutraged authorities. For a great part of his life he resided at Cirey\r\nin Lorraine,--with his mistress, his books, his half-finished plays,\r\nand his laboratory--for Voltaire, like all _philosophes_, had to\r\nplay at science. Here he lived in constant readiness to flee over the\r\nborder if the king should move against him. For a time he lived in\r\nGermany as the protégé of Frederick the Great, but he treated that\r\nirascible monarch with neither tact nor deference, and soon left Berlin\r\nto escape the king's ire. He visited Catherine the Great of Russia. He\r\nalso lived at Geneva for a while, but even there he failed to keep\r\npeace with the magistrates.\r\n\r\nSuch conflicts with established authority only increased his fame.\r\nMoreover, his three years' exile in England (1726-1729) had been of\r\nuntold value, for they had given him a first-hand acquaintance with\r\nEnglish rationalism. He had been brought up to discount religious\r\n\"superstition\" but the English thinkers provided him with a well-\r\nconsidered philosophy. Full of enthusiasm for the ideas of his English\r\nfriends, he wrote _Letters on the English_--a triumph of deistic\r\nphilosophy and sarcastic criticism of church and society.\r\n\r\nThe opinions which Voltaire henceforth never ceased to expound had long\r\nbeen held by English rationalists. He combined (1) admiration for\r\nexperimental science with (2) an exalted opinion of his own ability to\r\nreason out the \"natural laws\" which were supposed to lie at the base of\r\nhuman nature, religion, society, the state, and the universe in\r\ngeneral. (3) He was a typical Deist, thinking that the God who had made\r\nthe myriad stars of the firmament and who had promulgated eternal laws\r\nfor the universe, would hardly concern Himself with the soul of Pierre\r\nor Jean. To him all priests were impostors, and sacraments meaningless\r\nmummery, and yet he would not abolish religion entirely. Voltaire often\r\nsaid that he believed in a \"natural religion,\" but never explained it\r\nfully. Indeed, he was far more interested in tearing down than in\r\nbuilding up, and disposed rather to scoff at the priests, teachings,\r\nand practices of the Catholic Church than to convert men to a better\r\nreligion. (4) Likewise in his criticism of government and of society,\r\nhe confined himself mostly to bitter denunciations of contemporaneous\r\nconditions, without offering a substitute or suggesting practical\r\nreforms. His nearest approach to the practical was his admiration for\r\nEnglish institutions, but he never explained how the \"liberties\" of\r\nEngland were to be transplanted into France.\r\n\r\nVoltaire was not an acutely original thinker. Nevertheless, his\r\ninnumerable tragedies, comedies, histories, essays, and letters\r\nestablished his reputation as the most versatile and accomplished\r\nwriter of his age. But all the \"hundred volumes\" of Voltaire are rarely\r\nread today. They are clever, to be sure, witty, graceful,--but\r\nadmittedly superficial. He thought that he could understand at a glance\r\nthe problems upon which more earnest men had spent their lives; he\r\nwould hurriedly dash off a tragedy, or in spare moments write a\r\npretentious history. He was not always accurate but he was always\r\nclever.\r\n\r\nLet us remember him as, at the age of eighty-four, he pays a famous\r\nvisit to Paris,--a sprightly old man with wrinkled face, and with sharp\r\nold eyes peering out from either side of the long nose, beaming with\r\npride at the flattery of his admirers, sparkling with pleasure as he\r\nmakes a witty repartee. The ladies call him a most amusing old cynic.\r\nCynic he is, and old. His life work has been scoffing. Yet Voltaire is\r\nunquestionably the intellectual dictator of Europe. His genius for\r\nsatire and his fearless attacks on long-standing abuses have made him\r\nhated, and feared, and admired. He has given tone and character to the\r\nOld Régime.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diderot and the Encyclopedists]\r\n\r\nVoltaire was not alone in the work of spreading discontent. Less famous\r\nbut hardly less brilliant or versatile, was Denis Diderot (1713-1784).\r\nHis great achievement was the editing of the _Encyclopedia_. The\r\ngathering of all human knowledge into one set of volumes--an\r\nencyclopedia--had been for generations a favorite idea in Europe.\r\nDiderot associated with himself the most distinguished mathematicians,\r\nastronomers, scientists, and philosophers of the time in the\r\ncompilation of a work which in seventeen volumes [Footnote: Not\r\ncounting pictorial supplements.] undertook to summarize the latest\r\nfindings of the scholarship of the age. Over four thousand copies had\r\nbeen subscribed when the _Encyclopedia_ appeared in 1765. It\r\nproved to be more than a monument of learning: it was a manifesto of\r\nradicalism. Its contributors were the apostles of rationalism and\r\ndeism, [Footnote: Some went even further and practically denied the\r\nexistence of God.] and their criticism of current ideas about religion,\r\nsociety, and science won many disciples to the new ideas.\r\n\r\nThe mission of Voltaire and the Encyclopedists (as the editors of the\r\n_Encyclopedia_ are called) was to disseminate knowledge and to\r\ndestroy prejudice, especially in religion. Practical specific reforms\r\nwere suggested by Montesquieu, Rousseau, Beccaria, and Adam Smith.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:  Montesquieu]\r\n\r\nMontesquieu (1689-1755), a French lawyer-nobleman, a student of natural\r\nscience, and an admirer of Newton, was the foremost writer of the\r\neighteenth century on the practice of government. In his _Persian\r\nLetters_, and more especially in _The Spirit of the Laws_\r\n(1748), he argued that government is a complicated matter and, to be\r\nsuccessful, must be adapted to the peculiarities of a particular\r\npeople. Theoretically he preferred a republic, and the Constitution of\r\nthe United States consciously embodied many of his theories.\r\nPractically, he considered the government of Great Britain very\r\nadmirable, and although it sheltered many abuses, as we shall presently\r\nsee, [Footnote:  See below, pp. 432 ff.] nevertheless he urged the\r\nFrench to pattern their political organization after it. Moderation was\r\nthe motto of Montesquieu.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rousseau]\r\n\r\nA more radical reformer was Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778). In his\r\nlife Rousseau was everything he should not have been. He was a failure\r\nas footman, as servant, as tutor, as secretary, as music copier, as\r\nlace maker. He wandered in Turin, Paris, Vienna, London. His immorality\r\nwas notorious,--he was not faithful in love, and his children were sent\r\nto a foundling asylum. He was poverty-stricken, dishonest,\r\ndiscontented, and, in his last years, demented.\r\n\r\nYet this man, who knew so little how to live his own life, exercised a\r\nwonderful influence over the lives of others. Sordid as was his career,\r\nthe man himself was not without beautiful and generous impulses. He\r\nloved nature in an age when other men simply studied nature. He liked\r\nto look at the clear blue sky, or to admire the soft green fields and\r\nshapely trees, and he was not ashamed to confess it. The emotions had\r\nbeen forgotten while philosophers were praising the intellect: Rousseau\r\nreminded the eighteenth century that after all it may be as sane to\r\nenjoy a sunset as to solve a problem in algebra. Rousseau possessed the\r\nsoul of a poet.\r\n\r\nTo him right feeling was as important as right thinking, and in this\r\nrespect he quarreled with the rationalists who claimed that common\r\nsense alone was worth while. Rousseau was a Deist--at most he believed\r\nbut vaguely in a \"Being, whatever He may be, Who moves the universe and\r\norders all things.\" But he detested the cold reasoning of philosophers\r\nwho conceived of God as too much interested in watching the countless\r\nstars obey His eternal laws, to stoop to help puny mortals with their\r\npetty affairs. \"0 great philosophers!\" cried Rousseau, \"How much God is\r\nobliged to you for your easy methods and for sparing Him work.\" And\r\nagain Rousseau warns us to \"flee from those [Voltaire and his like]\r\nwho, under the pretense of explaining nature, sow desolating doctrines\r\nin the hearts of men, and whose apparent skepticism is a hundred times\r\nmore ... dogmatic\" than the teachings of priests. Rousseau was not an\r\northodox Christian, nor a calmly rational Deist; he simply felt that\r\n\"to love God above all things, and your neighbor as yourself, is the\r\nsum of the law.\"\r\n\r\nThis he reproached the philosophers with not doing. Rousseau had seen\r\nand felt the bitter suffering of the poor, and he had perceived the\r\ncynical indifference with which educated men often regarded it. Science\r\nand learning seemed to have made men only more selfish. Indeed, the\r\nignorant peasant seemed to him humbler and more virtuous than the\r\npompous pedant. In a passionate protest--his _Discourse on Arts and\r\nSciences_ (1749)--Rousseau denounced learning as the badge of\r\nselfishness and corruption, for it was used to gratify the pride and\r\nchildish curiosity of the rich, rather than to right the wrongs of the\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it were better, he contended, that all men should be savages,\r\nthan that a few of the most cunning, cruel, and greedy should make\r\nslaves of the rest. His love of nature, his contempt for the silly\r\nshowiness and shallow hypocrisy of eighteenth-century society, made the\r\nidea a favorite one. He loved to dream of the times [Footnote: It must\r\nbe confessed that here Rousseau was dreaming of times that probably\r\nnever existed.] when men were all free and equal, when nobody claimed\r\nto own the land which God had made for all, when there were no wars to\r\nkill, no taxes to oppress, no philosophers to deceive the people.\r\n\r\nIn an essay inquiring _What is the Origin of Inequality among Men_\r\n(1753), Rousseau sought to show how vanity, greed, and selfishness had\r\nfound lodgment in the hearts of these \"simple savages,\" how the\r\nstrongest had fenced off plots of land for themselves and forced the\r\nweak to acknowledge the right of private property. This, said Rousseau,\r\nwas the real origin of inequality among men, of the tyranny of the\r\nstrong over the weak; and this law of private property \"for the profit\r\nof a few ambitious men, subjected thenceforth all the human race to\r\nlabor, servitude, and misery.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea was applied to government in a treatise entitled the _Social\r\nContract_ (1761). The \"social-contract\" theory was not new, but\r\nRousseau made it famous. He taught that government, law, and social\r\nconventions were the outcome of an agreement or contract by which at\r\nthe misty dawn of history all members of the state had voluntarily\r\nbound themselves. All governments exercised their power in last\r\nanalysis by virtue of this social contract, by will of the people.\r\nLaws, therefore, should be submitted to popular vote. The republic is\r\nthe best form of government, because it is the most sensitive to the\r\ndesires of the people. This idea of \"popular sovereignty,\" or rule of\r\nthe people, was in men's minds when they set up a republic in France\r\nfourteen years after the death of Rousseau.\r\n\r\nRousseau's cry, \"Back to nature,\" had still another aspect. He said\r\nthat children should be allowed to follow their natural inclinations,\r\ninstead of being driven to study. They should learn practical, useful\r\nthings, instead of Latin and Greek. \"Let them learn what they must do\r\nwhen they are men, and not what they must forget.\"\r\n\r\nIt is hard to fix limits to the influence of Rousseau's writings. True,\r\nboth the orthodox Catholics and the philosophical Deists condemned him.\r\nBut his followers were many, both bourgeois and noble. \"Back to nature\"\r\nbecame the fad of the day, and court ladies pretended to live a\r\n\"natural\" life and to go fishing. His theory of the social contract,\r\nhis contention that wealth should not be divided among a few, his idea\r\nthat the people should rule themselves,--these were to be the\r\ninspiration of the republican stage of the French Revolution, and in\r\ntime to permeate all Europe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beccaria]\r\n\r\nThe spirit of reform was applied not only against the clergy, the\r\nnobles, the monarchy, and faulty systems of law and education, but\r\nlikewise to the administration of justice. Hitherto the most barbarous\r\n\"punishments\" had been meted out. A pickpocket might be hung for\r\nstealing a couple of shillings [Footnote: In England.]; for a more\r\nserious offense the criminal might have his bones broken and then be\r\nlaid on his back on a cart-wheel, to die in agony while crowds looked\r\non and jeered. In a book entitled _Crimes and Punishments_ (1764),\r\nan Italian marquis of the name of Beccaria (1738-1794) held that such\r\npunishments were not only brutal and barbarous, but did not serve to\r\nprevent crimes as effectually as milder sentences, promptly and surely\r\nadministered. Beccaria's ideas are the basis of our modern laws,\r\nalthough the death penalty still lingers in a few cases.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political Economy: the Physiocrats]\r\n\r\nIn yet another sphere--that of economics--philosophers were examining\r\nthe old order of things, and asking, as ever, \"Is it reasonable?\" As we\r\nhave repeatedly observed, most governments had long followed the\r\nmercantilist plan more or less consistently. But in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, François Quesnay, a bourgeois physician at the court of Louis\r\nXV, announced to his friends that mercantilism was all wrong. He became\r\nthe center of a little group of philosophers who called themselves\r\n\"economists,\" and who taught that a nation's wealth comes from farming\r\nand mining; that manufacturers and traders produce nothing new, but\r\nmerely exchange or transport commodities. The manufacturers and\r\nmerchants should therefore be untaxed and unhampered. _Laissez-\r\nfaire_--\"Let them do as they will.\" Let the farmers pay the taxes.\r\nThe foremost disciple of _laisser-faire_ in France was Turgot\r\n(1727-1781). As minister of finance under Louis XVI he attempted to\r\nabolish duties and restrictions on commerce, but his efforts were only\r\npartially successful.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Adam Smith]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a Scotchman, who had visited France and had known Quesnay,\r\nwas conveying the new ideas across the Channel. It was Adam Smith, the\r\n\"father of political economy.\" Smith was quite in harmony with the\r\nphilosophic spirit, with its \"natural rights,\" \"natural religion,\" and\r\n\"natural laws.\" He was a professor of \"moral philosophy\" in the\r\nUniversity of Glasgow, and as an incident of his philosophical\r\nspeculations, he thought out a system of political economy,\r\n_i.e._, the \"laws\" by which a nation might increase its wealth, on\r\nthe lines suggested by Quesnay. Adam Smith's famous book _The Wealth\r\nof Nations_ appeared in 1776, the year of American independence. It\r\nwas a declaration of independence for industry. Let each man, each\r\nemployer of labor, each seller of merchandise follow his own personal\r\nbusiness interests without let or hindrance, for in so doing he is \"led\r\nby an invisible hand\" to promote the good of all. Let the government\r\nabolish all monopolies, [Footnote: He was somewhat inconsistent in\r\napproving joint-stock monopolies and shipping regulations.] all\r\nrestrictions on trade, all customs duties, all burdens on industry.\r\nThus only can the true wealth of a nation be promoted.\r\n\r\nSmith's opinions were so plausible and his arguments so ingenious that\r\nhis doctrines steadily gained in influence, and in the first half of\r\nthe nineteenth century pretty generally triumphed. In actual practice\r\nthe abolition of restrictions on industry was destined to give free\r\nrein to the avarice and cruelty of the most selfish employers, to\r\nenrich the bourgeoisie, and to leave the lower classes more miserable\r\nthan ever. The \"Wealth of Nations\" was to be the wealth of the\r\nbourgeoisie. But meanwhile, it was to destroy mercantilism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conclusion]\r\n\r\nWe have now completed our survey of the social, religious, and\r\nintellectual conditions in the Europe of the eighteenth century. Before\r\nour eyes have passed poverty-stricken peasants plowing their fields,\r\nprosperous merchants who demand power, frivolous nobles squandering\r\ntheir lives and fortunes, worldly bishops neglecting their duties,\r\nhumble priests remaining faithful, sober Quakers refusing to fight,\r\nearnest astronomers who search the skies, sarcastic Deists who scoff at\r\npriests, and bourgeois philosophers who urge reform. The procession is\r\nnot quite done. Last of all come the kings in their royal ermine and\r\nministers in robes of state. To them we dedicate a new chapter. It will\r\nbe the last occasion on which kings will merit such detailed attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL READING\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL SOCIAL CONDITIONS IN EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY EUROPE.

Philosophers might plead for reform, but only the king could\r\ngrant it. For in him were vested all powers of government: he was the\r\nabsolute monarch.\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation in virtually every important country in Europe.\r\nIn Great Britain alone were the people even reputed to have a share in\r\nthe government, and to Great Britain the Voltaires and the Montesquieus\r\nof the Continent turned for a model in politics. Let us join them in\r\nconsidering the peculiar organization of the British monarchy, and then\r\nwe shall observe how the other governments of Europe met the demand for\r\nreform.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH MONARCHY\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: England. Scotland]\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century, what was the British monarchy? It was, first\r\nof all, the government of England (which included Wales). Secondly, it\r\nembraced Scotland, for since 1603 Scotland and England had been subject\r\nto the same king, and in 1707 by the Act of Union the two kingdoms had\r\nbeen united to form the monarchy of \"Great Britain,\" with a common king\r\nand a common Parliament.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Great Britain]\r\n\r\nThe British monarchy was properly, then, the government of united\r\nEngland (Wales) and Scotland. But in addition the crown had numerous\r\nsubordinate possessions: the royal colonies, [Footnote: The royal\r\ncolonies were, in 1800: Newfoundland (1583), Barbados (1605), Bermudas\r\n(1609), Gambia (c. 1618), St. Christopher (1623), Nevis (1628),\r\nMontserrat (1632), Antigua (1632), Honduras (1638), St. Lucia (1638),\r\nGold Coast (c. 1650), St. Helena (1651), Jamaica (1655), Bahamas\r\n(1666), Virgin Islands (1666), Gibraltar (1704), Hudson Bay Territory\r\n(1713), Nova Scotia (1713), New Brunswick (1713), Quebec, Ontario, and\r\nPrince Edward Island (1763), Dominica (17633), St. Vincent (1763),\r\nGrenada (1763), Tobago (1763), Falkland (1765), Pitcairn (1780),\r\nStraits Settlements (1786 ff.), Sierra Leone (1787), New South Wales\r\n(1788), Ceylon (1795), Trinidad (1797), and, under the East India\r\nCompany, Madras (1639), Bombay (1661), and Bengal (1633-1765).] and\r\nIreland. For these dependencies the home government appointed\r\ngovernors, made laws, and levied taxes, in theory at least; but they\r\nwere possessions rather than integral parts of the monarchy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ireland]\r\n\r\nA few words should be said in explanation of the political status of\r\nIreland under the British crown. The English kings had begun their\r\nconquests in that island as far back as the twelfth century; and by\r\ndint of much bloodshed and many efforts they had long maintained\r\npossession. In the seventeenth century Oliver Cromwell had put down a\r\nbitter revolt and had encouraged Protestant English and Scotch\r\nimmigrants to settle in the north and east, taking the land from the\r\nnative Irishmen, who were Roman Catholics. An Irish parliament had\r\nexisted since the middle ages, but from the close of the fifteenth\r\ncentury its acts to be valid required the approval of the English Privy\r\nCouncil, and from the middle of the seventeenth century Roman Catholics\r\nwere debarred from it. In 1782, however, while Great Britain was\r\nengaged in the War of American Independence, the Protestants in Ireland\r\nsecured the right to make most of their own laws, and ten years later\r\nthe Catholic disqualifications were removed. From 1782 to 1801, Ireland\r\nretained this half-way independence; but a Protestant minority actually\r\ncontrolled the Irish Parliament, incurring the dislike of the Roman\r\nCatholic Irish and of the British government, so that in 1800,\r\nfollowing an Irish revolt, an Act of Union was passed, according to\r\nwhich, in 1801, Great Britain and Ireland became the United Kingdom.\r\nThenceforth Ireland was represented by 28 peers and 100 Commoners in\r\nthe Parliament of the United Kingdom (often called, carelessly, the\r\nBritish Parliament).\r\n\r\nIt may be said, then, that except during the brief period of Irish\r\nsemi-independence (1782-1801), the British Parliament governed not only\r\nGreat Britain, but Ireland and the crown colonies as well. How the\r\nBritish monarchy was governed, we have now to discover.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The King and his Nominal Powers]\r\n\r\nIn theory the king was still the ruler of his kingdom. In his name all\r\nlaws were made, treaties sealed, governmental officials appointed. Like\r\nother monarchs, he had his \"Privy Councilors\" to advise him, and\r\nministers (Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretaries of State, the\r\nLord Chancellor, etc.) to supervise various details of central\r\nadministration. But this was largely a matter of form. In fact, the\r\nkings of Great Britain had lost most of their power, and retained only\r\ntheir dignity; they were becoming figureheads.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The British Constitution]\r\n\r\nEver since the signing of _Magna Carta_, back in 1215, the English\r\npeople had been exacting from their sovereigns written promises by\r\nwhich the crown surrendered certain powers. Greatest progress in this\r\ndirection had been made amid those stirring scenes of the seventeenth\r\ncentury which have been described already in the chapter on the Triumph\r\nof Parliamentary Government in England. In addition to formal\r\ndocuments, there had been slowly evolved a body of customs and usages,\r\nwhich were almost as sacred and binding as if they had been inscribed\r\non parchment. Taken together, these written and customary limitations\r\non royal authority were called the \"British Constitution.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Limitations on the Actual Powers of the King]\r\n\r\nThis Constitution limited the king's power in four important ways. (1)\r\nIt deprived him of the right to levy taxes. For his household expenses\r\nhe was now granted an allowance, called the Civil List. William III,\r\nfor instance, was allowed £700,000 pounds a year. (2) The king had no\r\nright either to make laws on his own responsibility or to prevent laws\r\nbeing made against his will. The sovereign's prerogative to veto\r\nParliament's bills still existed in theory, but was not exercised after\r\nthe reign of Queen Anne. (3) The king had lost control of the judicial\r\nsystem (_i.e._, the courts): he could not remove judges even if\r\nthey gave decisions unfavorable to him; and the Habeas Corpus Act of\r\n1679 provided that any one thrown into prison should be told why, and\r\ngiven a fair legal trial. (4) The king could not maintain a standing\r\narmy without consent of Parliament. These restrictions made Great\r\nBritain a \"limited,\" rather than an \"absolute,\" monarchy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parliament]\r\n\r\nThe powers taken from the king were now exercised by Parliament. The\r\nconstitutional conflict of the seventeenth century had left Parliament\r\nnot only in enjoyment of freedom of speech for its members but with\r\nfull power to levy taxes, to make laws, to remove or retain judges, and\r\nessentially to determine the policy of the government in war and in\r\npeace. Parliament had even taken upon itself on one celebrated occasion\r\n(1689) to deprive a monarch of his \"divine right\" to rule, to establish\r\na new sovereign, and to decree that never again should Great Britain\r\nhave a king of the Roman Catholic faith.\r\n\r\nFrench philosophers who saw so much power vested in a representative\r\nbody could not be too loud in their praise of \"English liberty.\" Had\r\nthey investigated more closely, these same observers might have learned\r\nto their surprise that Parliament represented the people of Great\r\nBritain only in name.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Undemocratic Character of Parliament]\r\n\r\nAs we have seen in an earlier chapter [Footnote:  See above, pp. 265\r\nf.], Parliament consisted of two legislative assemblies or \"Houses,\"\r\nneither one of which could make laws without the consent of the other.\r\nOne of these houses, the House of Lords, was frankly aristocratic and\r\nundemocratic. Its members were the \"lords spiritual\"--rich and\r\ninfluential bishops of the Anglican Church,--and the \"lords temporal,\"\r\nor peers, haughty descendants of the ancient feudal nobles or haughtier\r\nheirs of millionaires recently ennobled by the king. [Footnote: A peer\r\nwas technically a titled noble who possessed an hereditary seat in the\r\nHouse of Lords. George III created many peers: at his death there were\r\nover 300 in all.] These proud gentlemen were mainly landlords, and as a\r\nclass they were almost as selfish and undemocratic as the courtiers of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nBut, the French philosopher replies, the representatives of the people\r\nare found in the lower house, the House of Commons; the peers merely\r\ngive stability to the government. Let us see.\r\n\r\nOne thing at least is certain, that in the eighteenth century the\r\nmajority of the people of Great Britain had no voice in choosing their\r\n\"representatives.\" In the country, the \"knights of the shire\" were\r\nsupposedly elected, two for each shire or county. But a man could not\r\nvote unless he had an estate worth an annual rent of forty shillings,\r\nand, since the same amount of money would then buy a good deal more\r\nthan nowadays, forty shillings was a fairly large sum. Persons who\r\ncould vote were often afraid to vote independently, and frequently they\r\nsold their vote to a rich noble, so that many \"knights of the shire\"\r\nwere practically named by the landed aristocracy, the wealthy and\r\ntitled landlords.\r\n\r\nMatters were even worse in the towns, or \"boroughs.\" By no means all of\r\nthe towns had representation. Moreover, for the towns that did choose\r\ntheir two members to sit in the House of Commons, no method of election\r\nwas prescribed by law; but each borough followed its own custom. In one\r\ntown the aristocratic municipal corporation would choose the\r\nrepresentatives; in another place the gilds would control the election;\r\nand in yet another city there might be a few so-called \"freemen\" (of\r\ncourse everybody was free,--\"freeman\" was a technical term for a member\r\nof the town corporation) who had the right to vote, and sold their\r\nvotes regularly for about £5 apiece. In general the town\r\nrepresentatives were named by a few well-to-do politicians, while the\r\ncommon 'prentices and journeymen worked uninterruptedly at their\r\nbenches. It has been estimated that fewer than 1500 persons controlled\r\na majority in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nIn many places a nobleman or a clique of townsmen appointed their\r\ncandidates without even the formality of an election. In other places,\r\nwhere rival influences clashed, bribery would decide the day. For in\r\ncontested elections, the voting lasted forty days, during which time\r\nthe price of votes might rise to £25 or more. Votes might be purchased\r\nwith safety, too, for voting was public and any one might learn from\r\nthe poll-book how each man had voted. Not infrequently it cost several\r\nthousand pounds to carry such an election.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Rotten Boroughs\"]\r\n\r\nWe may summarize these evils by saying that the peasants and artisans\r\ngenerally were not allowed to vote, and that the methods of election\r\ngave rise to corruption. But this was not all. There was neither rhyme\r\nnor reason to be found in the distribution of representation between\r\ndifferent sections of the country. Old Sarum had once been a prosperous\r\nvillage and had been accorded representation, but after the village had\r\ndisappeared, leaving to view but a lonely hill, no one in England could\r\nhave told why two members should still sit for Old Sarum. Nor, for that\r\nmatter, could there have been much need of representation in Parliament\r\nfor the sea-coast town of Dunwich. Long ago the coast had sunk and the\r\nsalt-sea waves now washed the remains of a ruined town. Bosseney in\r\nCornwall was a hamlet of three cottages, but its citizens were entitled\r\nto send two men to Parliament.\r\n\r\nWhile these decayed towns and \"rotten boroughs\" continued to enjoy\r\nrepresentation, populous and opulent cities like Birmingham,\r\nManchester, Leeds, and Sheffield were ignored. They had grown with the\r\ngrowth of industry, while the older towns had declined. Yet\r\nParliamentary representation underwent no change from the days of\r\nCharles II to the third decade of the nineteenth century. Thus\r\nParliament in the eighteenth century represented neither the different\r\nclasses of society nor the masses of population. Politics was a\r\ngentleman's game. The nobleman who sat in the upper house had his\r\ndummies in the lower chamber. A certain Sir James Lowther had nine\r\nprotégés in the lower house, who were commonly called \"Lowther's\r\nNinepins.\" A distinguished statesman of the time described the position\r\nof such a protégé: \"He is sent here by the lord of this or the duke of\r\nthat, and if he does not obey the instructions which he receives, he is\r\nheld to be a dishonest man.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parliamentary Bribery and Corruption]\r\n\r\nUnder conditions such as these it is not hard to understand how seats\r\nin Parliament were bought and sold like boxes at the opera or seats in\r\na stock-exchange. Nor is it surprising that after having paid a small\r\nfortune for the privilege of representing the people, the worldly-wise\r\nCommoner should be willing to indemnify himself by accepting bribes,\r\nor, if perchance his tender conscience forbade monetary bribes, by\r\naccepting a government post with fat salary and few duties except to\r\nvote with the government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Cabinet]\r\n\r\nFor many years (1714-1761) the arts of corruption were practiced with\r\nastonishing success by a group of clever Whig politicians. As has been\r\nnoticed in an earlier chapter,[Footnote: See above, pp. 291 f.] it was\r\nto their most conspicuous leader, Sir Robert Walpole, that the first\r\ntwo Georges intrusted the conduct of affairs; and Walpole filled the\r\nimportant offices of state with his Whig friends. Likewise it has been\r\nnoticed [Footnote: See above, p. 290.] that during the same period the\r\nidea of the cabinet system became more firmly fixed. Just as Walpole\r\nsecured the appointment of his friends to the high offices of state, so\r\nsubsequent statesmen put their supporters in office. The practice was\r\nnot yet rigid, but it was customary for a dozen or so of the leaders of\r\nthe faction in power to hold \"cabinet\" meetings, in which they decided\r\nin advance what measures should be presented to Parliament. If a\r\nmeasure indorsed by the cabinet should be defeated by the Commons, the\r\nleader of the party would normally resign, and the ministers he had\r\nappointed would follow his example. In other words, the cabinet acted\r\nin concert and resigned as a whole.\r\n\r\nIf the affairs of the government were all carried on by the cabinet,\r\nand if the cabinet depended for its support on the majority in the\r\nHouse of Commons, what remained for the king to do? Obviously, very\r\nlittle!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British Government under George III]\r\n\r\nGeorge I and George II had not been averse from cabinet-government: it\r\nwas easy and convenient. But George III (1760-1820) was determined to\r\nmake his authority felt. He wished to preside at cabinet meetings; he\r\noutbribed the Whigs; and he repeatedly asked his ministers to resign\r\nbecause he disliked their policies.\r\n\r\nBesides the friends he purchased, George III possessed a considerable\r\nnumber of enthusiastic and conscientious supporters. The country\r\nsquires and clergy who believed in the Anglican Church and looked with\r\ndistrust upon the power of corrupt Whig politicians in Parliament, were\r\nquite willing that a painstaking and gentlemanly monarch should do his\r\nown ruling. Such persons formed the backbone of the Tory party and\r\nsometimes called themselves the \"king's friends.\" With their support\r\nand by means of a liberal use of patronage, George III was able to keep\r\nLord North, a minister after his own heart, in power twelve years\r\n(1770-1782). But as we have learned, [Footnote: See above, pp. 332 ff.]\r\nthe War of American Independence caused the downfall of Lord North, and\r\nfor the next year or two, politics were in confusion. During 1782-1783\r\nthe old Whig and Tory parties [Footnote: See above, pp. 285 f.] were\r\nsadly broken up, and a new element was unmistakably infused into party-\r\nwarfare by the spirit of reform.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Need and Demand for Reform]\r\n\r\nSurely, if ever a country needed reform, it was Great Britain in 1783.\r\nThe country was filled with paupers maintained by the taxes; poor\r\npeople might be shut up in workhouses and see their children carted off\r\nto factories; sailors were kidnapped for the royal navy; the farmhand\r\nwas practically bound to the soil like a serf; over two hundred\r\noffenses, such as stealing a shilling or cutting down an apple tree,\r\nwere punishable by death; religious intolerance flourished--Quakers\r\nwere imprisoned and Roman Catholics were debarred from office and\r\nParliament. And Ireland was being ruined by the selfish and obstinate\r\nminority which controlled its parliament.\r\n\r\nBut about these things English \"reformers\" were not much concerned. A\r\nfew altruistic souls decried the traffic in black slaves, but that evil\r\nwas quite far from English shores. The reform movement was chiefly\r\ndirected against parliamentary corruption and received its support from\r\nthe small country gentlemen who hated the great Whig owners of \"pocket-\r\nboroughs,\" [Footnote: Boroughs whose members were named by a political\r\n\"patron.\"] and from the lower and newer ranks of the bourgeoisie. For\r\nthe small shop-keepers and tradesmen, and especially the rich\r\nmanufacturers in new industrial towns like Birmingham, felt that\r\nParliament did not represent their interests, and they set up a cry for\r\npure politics and reformed representation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wilkes]\r\n\r\nThe spirit of reform spread rapidly. In the 'sixties of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, John Wilkes, a squint-eyed and immoral but very persuasive\r\neditor, had raised a hubbub of reform talk. He had criticized the\r\npolicy of George III, had been elected to Parliament, and, when the\r\nHouse of Commons expelled him, had insisted upon the right of the\r\npeople to elect him, regardless of the will of the House. His admirers\r\n--and he had many--shouted for \"Wilkes and Liberty,\" elected him Lord\r\nMayor of London, and enabled him to carry his point.\r\n\r\nThe founding of four newspapers furthered the reform movement. They\r\ntook it upon themselves to report parliamentary debates, and along with\r\ninformation they spread discontent. Their activity was somewhat\r\nchecked, however, by the operation of the old laws which punished\r\nlibelous attacks on the king with imprisonment or exile, and also by a\r\nstamp duty of 2-1/2d. a sheet (1789).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles James Fox]\r\n\r\nUnder the new influence a number of Whigs became advocates of reform.\r\nGeorge III had outdone them at corruption; they now sought to\r\nreëstablish their own power and Parliament's by advocating reform. Of\r\nthese Whigs, Charles James Fox (1749-1806) was the most prominent. Fox\r\nhad been taught to gamble by his father and took to it readily. Cards\r\nand horse-racing kept him in constant bankruptcy; many of his nights\r\nwere spent in debauchery and his mornings in bed; and his close\r\nassociation with the rakish heir to the throne was the scandal of\r\nLondon. In spite of his eloquence and ability, the loose manner of his\r\nlife militated against the success of Fox as a reformer. His friends\r\nknew him to be a free-hearted, impulsive sympathizer with all who were\r\noppressed, and they entertained no doubt of his sincere wish to bring\r\nabout parliamentary reform, complete religious toleration, and the\r\nabolition of the slave trade. But strangers could not easily reconcile\r\nhis private life with his public words, and were antagonized by his\r\nfrequent lack of political tact.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Program of Reform]\r\n\r\nDespite drawbacks Fox furthered the cause of reform to a considerable\r\nextent. He it was who presided over a great mass meeting, held under\r\nthe auspices of a reform club, at which meeting was drawn up a program\r\nof liberal reform, a program which was to be the battle-cry of British\r\npolitical radicals for several generations. It comprised six demands:\r\n(1) Votes for all adult males, (2) each district to have representation\r\nproportionate to its population, (3) payment of the members of\r\nParliament so as to enable poor men to accept election, (4) abolition\r\nof the property qualifications for members of Parliament, (5) adoption\r\nof the secret ballot, and (6) Parliaments to be elected annually.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: William Pitt the Younger]\r\n\r\nSuch reform seemed less likely of accomplishment by Fox than by a\r\nyounger statesman, William Pitt (1759-1806), second son of the famous\r\nearl of Chatham. When but seven years old, Pitt had said: \"I want to\r\nspeak in the House of Commons like papa.\" Throughout his boyhood and\r\nyouth he had kept this ambition constantly before him; he had studied,\r\npracticed oratory, and learned the arts of debate. At the age of\r\ntwenty-one, he was a tall, slender, and sickly youth, with sonorous\r\nvoice, devouring ambition, and sublime self-confidence. He secured a\r\nseat in the Commons as one of Sir James Lowther's \"ninepins,\" and\r\nspeedily won the respect of the House. He was the youngest and most\r\npromising of the politicians of the day. At the outset he was a Whig.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"New Tories\"]\r\n\r\nBy a combination of circumstances young Pitt was enabled to form an\r\nessentially new political party--the \"New Tories.\" By his scrupulous\r\nhonesty and earnest advocacy of parliamentary reform, he won to his\r\nside the unrepresented bourgeoisie and the opponents of \"bossism.\" On\r\nthe other hand, by accepting from King George III an appointment as\r\nchief minister, and holding the position in spite of a temporarily\r\nhostile majority in the House of Commons, Pitt won the respect of the\r\nTory country squires and the clergy, who stood for the king against\r\nParliament. And finally, being quite moral himself (if chronic\r\nindulgence in port wine be excepted), and supporting a notoriously\r\nvirtuous king against corrupt politicians and against the gambling Fox,\r\nPitt became an idol of all lovers of \"respectability.\"\r\n\r\nIn the parliamentary elections of 1784 Pitt won a great victory. In\r\nthat year he was prime minister with loyal majorities in both Houses of\r\nParliament, with royal favor, and with the support of popular\r\nenthusiasm. He was feasted in Grocers' Hall in London; the shopkeepers\r\nof the Strand illuminated their dwellings in his honor; and crowds\r\ncheered his carriage.\r\n\r\nReform seemed to be within sight. The horrors of the slave trade were\r\nmitigated, and greater freedom was given the press. Bills were\r\nintroduced to abolish the representation of \"rotten\" boroughs and to\r\ngrant representation to the newer towns.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Halt of Reform in Great Britain]\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be doubted that Pitt would have gone further had not\r\naffairs in France--the French Revolution--alarmed him at the critical\r\ntime and caused him fear a similar outbreak in England. [Footnote: For\r\nthe effect of the French Revolution upon England, see pp. 494 f., 504.]\r\nThe government and upper classes of Great Britain at once abandoned\r\ntheir roles as reformers, and set themselves sternly to repress\r\nanything that might savor of revolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conclusion]\r\n\r\nTwo important conclusions may now be drawn from our study of the\r\nBritish government in the eighteenth century. In the first place,\r\ndespite the admiration with which the French philosophers regarded the\r\nBritish monarchy as a model of political liberty and freedom, it was in\r\nfact both corrupt and oppressive. Secondly, the spirit of reform seemed\r\nfor a time as active and as promising in Great Britain as in France,\r\nbut from the island kingdom it was frightened away by the tumult of\r\nrevolution across the Channel.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENLIGHTENED DESPOTS\r\n\r\nThe spirit of progress and reform had slowly made itself felt in Great\r\nBritain through popular agitation and in Parliament. On the Continent\r\nit naturally took a different turn, for there government certainly was\r\nnot by Parliaments, but by sovereigns \"by the Grace of God.\" In France,\r\nPrussia, Austria, Spain, and Russia, therefore, the question was\r\nalways, \"Will his Majesty be cruel, extravagant, and unprogressive; or\r\nwill he prove himself an able and liberal-minded monarch?\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Era of Benevolent Despotism on the Continent]\r\n\r\nIt happened during the eighteenth century that most of the Continental\r\nrulers were of this latter sort--conscientious and well-meaning. On the\r\nthrones of Austria, Prussia, Spain, Portugal, Tuscany, Sardinia,\r\nBavaria, and Sweden sat men of extraordinary ability, who sought rather\r\nthe welfare of their country than careless personal pleasure.\r\n\r\nThese were the benevolent despots. They were despots, absolute rulers,\r\ncountenancing no attempt to diminish royal authority, believing in\r\ngovernment by one strong hand rather than by the democratic many. But\r\nwith despotism they combined benevolence; they were anxious for the\r\nglory of their nation, and no less solicitous for the happiness and\r\nprosperity of their people. Thus the development of absolute monarchy\r\nand the rationalism of the eighteenth century united to produce the\r\nbenevolent despot. For this reason the term \"enlightened\" (i.e.,\r\nphilosophical) despot is frequently applied to these autocrats who\r\nattempted to rule in the light of reason.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Frederick the Great of Prussia, 1740-1786]\r\n\r\nOne of the most successful of the enlightened despots was Frederick II\r\n(the Great) of Prussia. In our chapter on the Germanies, [Footnote: See\r\nabove, ch. xi.] we have seen how he fought all Europe to gain prestige\r\nand power for Prussia; we shall now see how he endeavored to apply\r\nscientific methods to the government of his own country.\r\n\r\nWith the major intellectual interests of the eighteenth century,\r\nFrederick II became acquainted quite naturally. As a boy he had been\r\nfond of reading French plays, had learned Latin against his father's\r\nwill, had filled his mind with the ideas of deistic philosophers, and\r\nhad seemed likely to become a dreamer instead of a ruler. But the\r\ndogged determination of his father, King Frederick William I, to make\r\nsomething out of Frederick besides a flute-playing, poetizing\r\nphilosopher, had resulted in familiarizing him with elaborate financial\r\nreports and monotonous minutes of tiresome official transactions. Young\r\nFrederick, however, learned to like the details of administration and\r\nwhen he came to the throne in 1740 he was not only enlightened but\r\nindustrious.\r\n\r\nThe young king had a clear conception of his duties, and even wrote a\r\nbook in French about the theory of government. \"The prince,\" he said,\r\n\"is to the nation he governs what the head is to the man; it is his\r\nduty to see, think, and act for the whole community, that he may\r\nprocure it every advantage of which it is capable.\" \"The monarch is not\r\nthe absolute master, but only the first servant of the state.\"\r\nFrederick was indeed the first servant of Prussia, rising at five in\r\nthe morning, working on official business until eleven o'clock, and\r\nspending the afternoon at committee meetings or army reviews.\r\n\r\nHe set about laboriously to make Prussia the best and most governed\r\nstate in Europe. He carefully watched the judges to see that they did\r\nnot render wrongful decisions or take bribes. He commissioned jurists\r\nto compile the laws and to make them so simple and clear that no one\r\nwould violate them through ignorance. He abolished the old practice of\r\ntorturing suspected criminals to make them confess their guilt.\r\n\r\nEducation, as well as justice, claimed his attention; he founded\r\nelementary schools, so that as many as possible of his subjects could\r\nlearn at least to read and write. In religious affairs, Frederick\r\nallowed great individual liberty; for he was a deist, and, like other\r\ndeists of the time, believed in religious toleration.\r\n\r\nMore important even than justice, education, and toleration, he\r\nconsidered the promotion of material prosperity among his people. He\r\nwould have considered himself a failure, had his reign not meant \"good\r\ntimes\" for farmers and merchants. He encouraged industry. He fostered\r\nthe manufacture of silk. He invited thrifty farmers to move from other\r\ncountries and to settle in Prussia. He built canals. Marshes were\r\ndrained and transformed into rich pasture-land. If war desolated a part\r\nof the country, then, when peace was concluded, Frederick gave the\r\nfarmers seed and let them use his war-horses before the plow. He\r\nadvised landlords to improve their estates by planting orchards; and he\r\nencouraged peasants to grow turnips as fodder for cattle. Much was done\r\nto lighten the financial burdens of the peasantry, for (as Frederick\r\nhimself declared) if a man worked all day in the fields, \"he should not\r\nbe hounded to despair by tax-collectors.\"\r\n\r\nTaxes were not light by any means, but everybody knew that the king was\r\nnot squandering the money. Frederick was not a man to lavish fortunes\r\non worthless courtiers; he diligently examined all accounts; and his\r\nofficials dared not be extravagant for fear of being corporally\r\npunished, or, what was worse, of being held up to ridicule by the cruel\r\nwit of their royal master.\r\n\r\nIt was only this marvelous economy and careful planning that enabled\r\nPrussia to support an army of 200,000 men and to embark upon a policy\r\nof conquest, by which Silesia and a third of Poland were won. On the\r\narmy alone Frederick was willing to spend freely, but even in this\r\ndepartment he made sure that Prussia received its money's worth.\r\nTireless drill, strict discipline, up-to-date arms, and well-trained\r\nofficers made the Prussian army the envy and terror of eighteenth-\r\ncentury Europe.\r\n\r\nIn dwelling upon his seemingly successful attempts to govern in the\r\nlight of reason and common sense, we have almost forgotten Frederick's\r\nlove of philosophy. Let us recur to it before we take leave of him; for\r\nbenevolent despotism was only one side of the philosophical monarch. He\r\nliked to play his flute while thinking how to outwit Maria Theresa; he\r\ndelighted in making witty answers to tiresome reports and petitions; he\r\nenjoyed sitting at table with congenial companions discussing poetry,\r\nscience, and the drama. True, he did not encourage the rising young\r\nGerman poets Lessing and Goethe. He thought their work vulgar and\r\nuninspired. But he invited literary Frenchmen to come to Berlin, and he\r\nput new life into the Berlin Academy of Science. Even Voltaire was for\r\na time a guest at Frederick's court, and the amateurish poems written\r\nin French by the Prussian king were corrected by the \"prince of\r\nphilosophers.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Catherine the Great of Russia, 1762-1796]\r\n\r\nWhile Frederick was demonstrating that \"the prince is but the first\r\nservant of the state,\" Catherine II was playing the enlightened despot\r\nin Russia. In the course of her remarkable career, [Footnote: See\r\nabove, pp. 380 ff.] Catherine found time to write flattering letters to\r\nFrench philosophers, to make presents to Voltaire, and to invite\r\nDiderot to tutor her son. She posed, too, as a liberal-minded monarch,\r\nwilling to discuss the advisability of giving Russia a written\r\nconstitution, or of emancipating the serfs. Schools and academies were\r\nestablished, and French became the language of polite Russian society.\r\n\r\nAt heart Catherine was little moved by desire for real reform or by\r\npity for the peasants. She had the heavy whip--the knout--applied to\r\nthe bared backs of earnest reformers. Her court was scandalously\r\nimmoral, and she violated the conventions of matrimony without a qualm.\r\nFor some excuse or another, the promised constitution was never\r\nwritten, and the lot of the serfs tended to become actually worse. To\r\nthe governor of Moscow, the tsarina wrote: \"My dear prince, do not\r\ncomplain that the Russians have no desire for instruction; if I\r\ninstitute schools, it is not for us,--it is for Europe, where we must\r\nkeep our position in public opinion. But the day when our peasants\r\nshall wish to become enlightened, both you and I will lose our places.\"\r\nThis shows clearly that while Catherine wished to be considered an\r\nenlightened despot, she was at heart quite the reverse. Her true\r\ncharacter was not to be made manifest until the outbreak of the French\r\nRevolution, and then Catherine of Russia was to preach a crusade\r\nagainst reform.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles III of Spain, 1759-1788]\r\n\r\nThere were other benevolent despots, however, who were undoubtedly\r\nsincere. Charles III, with able ministers, made many changes in Spain.\r\n[Footnote: Charles III had previously been king of Naples (1735-1759)\r\nand had instituted many reforms in that kingdom] The Jesuits were\r\nsuppressed; the exaggerated zeal of the Inquisition was effectually\r\nchecked; police were put on the streets of Madrid; German farmers were\r\nencouraged to settle in Spain; roads and canals were built;\r\nmanufactures were fostered; science was patronized; and the fleet was\r\nnearly doubled. When Charles III died, after a reign of almost thirty\r\nyears, the revenues of Spain had tripled, and its population had\r\nincreased from seven to eleven millions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Joseph I of Portugal, 1750-1777]\r\n\r\nCharles's neighbor, Joseph I of Portugal, possessed in the famous\r\nPombal a minister who was both a typical philosopher and an active\r\nstatesman. Under his administration, industry, education, and commerce\r\nthrove in Portugal as in Spain. Gustavus III (1771-1792) of Sweden\r\nsimilarly made himself the patron of industry and the friend of the\r\nworkingman. In Italy, the king of Sardinia was freeing his serfs, while\r\nin Tuscany several important reforms were being effected by Duke\r\nLeopold, a younger brother of the Habsburg emperor, Joseph II.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Joseph II of Austria, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire]\r\n\r\nJoseph II, archduke of Austria and emperor of the Holy Roman Empire,\r\ncarried the theory of enlightened despotism to its greatest lengths. He\r\nwas at once the most enthusiastic and the most unsuccessful of all the\r\nbenevolent despots. In him is to be observed the most striking example\r\nof the aims, and likewise the weaknesses, of this generation of\r\nphilosopher-kings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His Heritage from Maria Theresa]\r\n\r\nBefore we consider Joseph's career, it is important to understand what\r\nhis mother, Maria Theresa (1740-1780), had already done for the\r\nHabsburg realms. We are familiar with her brave conduct in defense of\r\nher hereditary lands against the unscrupulous ambition of Frederick the\r\nGreat. [Footnote: See above ch. xi.] For her loss of Silesia she had\r\nobtained through the partition of Poland some compensation in Galicia\r\nand Moldavia. Her domestic policy is of present concern.\r\n\r\nThe troops furnished by vote of provincial assemblies, she welded\r\ntogether into a national army. German became the official language of\r\nmilitary officers; and a movement was begun to supplant Latin by German\r\nin the civil administration. The privileges of religious orders were\r\ncurtailed in the interest of strong government; and the papal bull\r\nsuppressing the Jesuits was enforced. The universities were remodeled;\r\nand the elaborate system of elementary and secondary schools, then\r\nestablished, survived with but little change until 1869.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa had begun reform along most of the lines which her son\r\nwas to follow. But in two important particulars she was unlike him and\r\nunlike the usual enlightened despot. In the first place, she was\r\npolitic rather than philosophical. She did not attempt wholesale\r\nreforms, or blindly follow fine theories, but introduced practical and\r\nmoderate measures in order to remedy evils. She was very careful not to\r\noffend the prejudices or traditions of her subjects. Secondly, Maria\r\nTheresa was a devout Roman Catholic. Love of her subjects was not a\r\ntheory with her,--it was a religious duty. A cynical Frederick the\r\nGreat might laugh at conscience, and to a Catherine morality might mean\r\nnothing; but Maria Theresa remained an ardent Christian in an age of\r\nunbelief and a pure woman when loose living was fashionable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Policies and Plans of Joseph II, 1780-1790]\r\n\r\nHer eldest son, Joseph II, [Footnote: Holy Roman Emperor (1765-1790),\r\nand sole ruler of the Habsburg dominions (1780-1790).] was brought up a\r\nRoman Catholic, and although strongly influenced by Rousseau's\r\nwritings, never seceded from the Church. But neither religion nor\r\nexpediency was his guiding principle. He said, \"I have made Philosophy\r\nthe legislator of my Empire: her logical principles shall transform\r\nAustria.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something very noble in the determination of the young ruler\r\nto do away with all injustice, to relieve the oppressed, and to lift up\r\nthose who had been trampled under foot. His ambition was to make\r\nAustria a strong, united, and prosperous kingdom, to be himself the\r\nbenefactor of his people, to protect the manufacturer, and to free the\r\nserf. Austria was to be remodeled as Rousseau would have wished--except\r\nin respect of Rousseau's basic idea of popular sovereignty.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity that Joseph II cannot be judged simply by his good\r\nintentions, for he was quite unfitted to carry out wholesome reforms.\r\nHe had derived his ideas from French philosophers rather than from\r\nactual life; he was so sure that his theories were right that he would\r\ntake no advice; he was impatient and would brook no delay in the\r\nwholesale application of his theories. Regardless of prejudice,\r\nregardless of tradition, regardless of every consideration of political\r\nexpediency, he rushed ahead on the path of reform.\r\n\r\nTo Joseph II it mattered not that Austria had long been the stronghold\r\nand her rulers the champions of Catholic Christianity. He insisted that\r\nno papal bulls should be published in his dominions without his own\r\nauthorization; he nominated the bishops; he confiscated church lands.\r\nSide altars and various emblems were removed from the churches, not\r\nbecause they were useless, for humble Christians still prayed to their\r\nGod before such altars, but because the emperor thought side altars\r\nwere signs of superstition. The old and well-loved ceremonies were\r\naltered at his command. Many monasteries were abolished. The clergy\r\nwere to be trained in schools controlled by the emperor. And, to cap\r\nthe climax, heretics and Jews were to be not only tolerated, but\r\nactually given the same rights as orthodox Catholics.\r\n\r\nMany of these measures were no doubt desirable, and one or two of them\r\nmight have been accomplished without causing much disturbance, but by\r\ntrying to reform everything at once, Joseph only shocked and angered\r\nthe clergy and such of his people as piously loved their religion.\r\n\r\nHis political policies, which were no more wisely conceived or\r\nexecuted, were three in number. (1) He desired to extend his\r\npossessions eastward to the Black Sea and southward to the Adriatic,\r\nwhile the distant Netherlands might conveniently be exchanged for near-\r\nby Bavaria. (2) He wished to get rid of all provincial assemblies and\r\nother vestiges of local independence, and to have all his territories\r\ngoverned uniformly by officials subject to himself. (3) He aimed to\r\nuplift the lower classes of his people, and to put down the proud\r\nnobles, so that all should be equal and all alike should look up to\r\ntheir benevolent, but all-powerful, ruler.\r\n\r\nThe first of these policies brought him only disastrous wars. His\r\ndesigns on Bavaria were frustrated by Frederick the Great, who posed as\r\nthe protector of the smaller German states. In the Balkan peninsula his\r\narmies fought much and gained little.\r\n\r\nHis administrative policy was as unfortunate as his territorial\r\nambition. Maria Theresa had taken some steps to simplify the\r\nadministration of her heterogeneous dominions, but she had wisely\r\nallowed Hungary, Lombardy, and the Netherlands to preserve certain of\r\nthe traditions and formulas of self-government, and she did everything\r\nto win the loyalty and confidence of her Hungarian subjects. Joseph, on\r\nthe other hand, carried the sacred crown of St. Stephen--treasured by\r\nall Hungarians--to Vienna; abolished the privileges of the Hungarian\r\nDiet, or congress; and with a stroke of the pen established a new\r\nsystem of government. He divided his lands into thirteen provinces,\r\neach under a military commander. Each province was divided into\r\ndistricts or counties, and these again into townships. There would be\r\nno more local privileges but all was to be managed from Vienna. The\r\narmy was henceforth to be on the Prussian model, and the peasants were\r\nto be forced to serve their terms in it. German was to be the official\r\nlanguage throughout the Habsburg realm. This was all very fine on\r\npaper, but in practice it was a gigantic failure. The Austrian\r\nNetherlands rose in revolt rather than lose their local autonomy; the\r\nTyrol did likewise; and angry protests came from Hungary. Local\r\nliberties and traditions could not be abolished by an imperial decree.\r\n\r\nFinally, in his attempts to reconstruct society, Joseph came to grief.\r\nHe directed that all serfs should become free men, able to marry\r\nwithout the consent of their lord, privileged to sell their land and to\r\npay a fixed rent instead of being compelled to labor four days a week\r\nfor their lord. Nobles and peasants alike were to share the burdens of\r\ntaxation, all paying 13 per cent on their land. Joseph intended still\r\nfurther to help the peasantry, for, he said \"I could never bring myself\r\nto skin two hundred good peasants to pay one do-nothing lord more than\r\nhe ought to have.\" He planned to give everybody a free elementary\r\neducation, to encourage industry, and to make all his subjects\r\nprosperous and happy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Failure of Joseph II]\r\n\r\nBut the peasants disliked compulsory military service and misunderstood\r\nhis reforms; the nobles were not willing to be deprived of their feudal\r\nrights; the bourgeoisie was irritated by his blundering attempts to\r\nencourage industry; the clergy preached against his religious policy.\r\nHe reigned only ten years; yet he was hated by many and loved by none;\r\nhe had met defeat abroad, and at home his subjects were in revolt.\r\n\r\nLittle wonder that as he lay dying (1790) with hardly friend or\r\nrelative near to comfort him, the discouraged reformer should have\r\nsighed: \"After all my trouble, I have made but few happy, and many\r\nungrateful.\" He directed that most of his \"reforms\" should be canceled,\r\nand proposed as an epitaph for himself the gloomy sentence: \"Here lies\r\nthe man who, with the best intentions, never succeeded in anything.\"\r\n[Footnote: The epitaph was not quite true. The serfs in Austria\r\nretained at least part of the liberty he had granted.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Weakness of Benevolent Despotism]\r\n\r\nJoseph II was not the only benevolent despot who met with\r\ndiscouragement. The fatal weakness of \"enlightened despotism\" was its\r\nfailure to enlist the sympathy and support of the people. Absolute\r\nrulers like Joseph II tried to force reforms on their peoples whether\r\nthe reforms were popularly desired or not. As a result, few of their\r\nmeasures were lasting, and ingratitude was uniformly their reward.\r\n\r\nIf all kings had possessed the supreme ability and genius of a\r\nFrederick the Great, enlightened despotism might still be in vogue. The\r\ntrouble was that even well-meaning monarchs like Joseph II were\r\nunpractical; and many sovereigns were not even well-meaning. In\r\nPrussia, the successor of Frederick the Great, King Frederick William\r\nII, had neither ability nor character; his weak rule undid the work of\r\nFrederick. The same thing happened in other countries: weakness\r\nsucceeded ability, extravagance wasted the fruits of economy, and\r\ncorruption ruined the work of reform. Absolute monarchy without good\r\nintentions proved terribly oppressive.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH MONARCHY\r\n\r\nIn no country was the evil side of absolutism exhibited so unmistakably\r\nas in France. During the eighteenth century the French government went\r\nfrom bad to worse, until at last it was altered not by peaceful reform\r\nbut by violent revolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French People better off than their Neighbors]\r\n\r\nAs far as their actual condition was concerned, the people of France\r\nwere, on the whole, better off than most Germans or Italians. Next to\r\nEngland, France had the most numerous, prosperous, and intelligent\r\nmiddle class; and her peasants were slightly above the serfs of other\r\nContinental countries. But the very fact that in material well-being\r\nthey were a little better off than their neighbors, made the French\r\npeople more critical of their government. The lower classes had not all\r\nbeen ground down until they were mere slaves without hope or courage;\r\non the contrary, there were many sturdy farmers and thrifty artisans\r\nwho hoped for better days and bitterly resented inequalities in society\r\nand abuses in the government. The bourgeoisie was even less inclined to\r\nbow to tyranny; it was numerous, intelligent, wealthy, and influential;\r\nit could see the mistakes of the royal administration and was hopeful\r\nof gaining a voice in the government. Thus, the people of France were\r\nkeener to feel wrongs and to resent the injustice of undutiful\r\nmonarchs.\r\n\r\nLet us glance at the crying abuses in the French state of the\r\neighteenth century, and then we shall understand how great was the\r\nguilt of that pleasure-loving despot--Louis XV (1715-1774).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Administration]\r\n[Sidenote: The King]\r\n\r\nThe French administrative system was confused and oppressive. In\r\ntheory, it was quite simple--the government was the king. As Louis XV\r\nhaughtily remarked: \"The sovereign authority is vested in my person...\r\nthe legislative power exists in myself alone... my people are one only\r\nwith me; national rights and national interests are necessarily\r\ncombined with my own and only rest in my hands.\"\r\n\r\nBut in practice, the king could not alone make laws, keep order, and\r\ncollect taxes, especially when he spent whole days hunting or gambling.\r\nHe contented himself with spending the state money, getting into wars,\r\nand occasionally interfering with the work of his ministers. And it was\r\nnecessary to intrust the actual conduct of affairs to a complicated\r\nsystem or no-system of royal officials.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Royal Council]\r\n\r\nThe highest rung in the ladder of officialdom was the Royal Council. It\r\nwas composed of the half dozen chief ministers and about thirty\r\ncouncilors who helped their chiefs to supervise the affairs of the\r\nkingdom,--issuing decrees, conferring on foreign policy, levying taxes,\r\nand acting on endless reports from local officials.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Local Administration. The Intendants]\r\n\r\nThe Royal Council had numerous local representatives. There were the\r\nbailiffs and seneschals, whose actual powers had quite disappeared, but\r\nwhose offices served to complicate matters. Then there were the\r\ngovernors of provinces, well-fed gentlemen with fat salaries and little\r\nto do. The bulk of local administration fell into the hands of the\r\nintendants and their sub-delegates. Each of the thirty-four intendants\r\n--the so-called \"Thirty Tyrants of France\"--was appointed by the king's\r\nministers and was like a petty despot in his district\r\n(_généralité_).\r\n\r\nThe powers of the intendant were extensive. He decided what share of\r\nthe district taxes each village and taxpayer should bear. He had his\r\nrepresentatives in each parish of his district, and through them he\r\nsupervised the police, the preservation of order, and the recruiting of\r\nthe army. He relieved the poor in bad seasons. The erection of a\r\nchurch, or the repair of a town hall, needed his sanction. When the\r\nRoyal Council ordered roads to be built, it was the intendant and his\r\nmen who directed the work and called the peasants out to do the labor.\r\nWith powers such as these, it was little wonder that the intendant was\r\ncalled _Monseigneur_--\"My lord.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Parlement of Paris]\r\n\r\nThe system of Royal Council, intendants, and sub-intendants would have\r\nbeen comparatively simple, had it not been complicated by the presence\r\nof numerous other political bodies, each of which claimed certain\r\ncustomary powers. First of all, there was the _Parlement_, or\r\nsupreme court, of Paris, primarily a judicial body which registered the\r\nroyal decrees. If the Parlement disliked a decree, it might refuse to\r\nregister it, until the king should hold a \"bed of justice\"--that is,\r\nshould formally summon the Parlement and in person command it to\r\nregister his decree.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Provincial Estates]\r\n\r\nThen there were provincial \"Estates,\" or assemblies, in a few of the\r\nprovinces. [Footnote: Such provinces were called _pays d'état_ and\r\nincluded Brittany, Languedoc, Provence, Roussillon, Dauphiné, Burgundy,\r\nFranche Comté, Alsace, Lorraine, Artois, Flanders, Corsica, etc. The\r\nlocal assemblies in these _pays d'état_ were by no means\r\nrepresentative of all the inhabitants. The remaining provinces, in\r\nwhich no vestiges of provincial self-government survived, were called\r\n_pays d'élection_: they included Ile de France, Orléanais,\r\nChampagne and Brie, Maine, Anjou, Poitou, Guyenne and Gascony,\r\nLimousin, Auvergne, Lyonnais, Bourbonnais, Touraine, Normandy, Picardy,\r\netc.]  These bodies, survivals of the middle ages, did not make laws\r\nbut had a voice in the apportionment of taxes among the parishes of the\r\nprovince, and exercised powers of supervision over road-building and\r\nthe collection of taxes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Town Councils]\r\n\r\nThe government of the towns was peculiar. The old gilds, now including\r\nonly a small number of the wealthiest burghers, elected a Town Council,\r\nwhich managed the property of the town, appointed tax-collectors, saw\r\nthat the town hall was kept in repair, and supervised the collection of\r\ncustoms duties on goods brought into the town. It is easy to perceive\r\nhow the Town Council and the intendant would have overlapping powers,\r\nand how considerable confusion might arise, especially since in\r\ndifferent towns the nature and the powers of the Town Council differed\r\nwidely. Matters were complicated still further by the fact that the\r\nmayors of the towns were not elected by the council, but appointed by\r\nthe crown.\r\n\r\nIn rural districts there was a trace of the same conflict between the\r\nsystem of intendants and the survivals of local self-government.\r\nSummoned by the clanging church bell, all the men of the village met on\r\nthe village green. And the simple villagers, thus gathered together as\r\na town meeting or communal assembly, might elect collectors of the\r\n_taille_, or might perhaps petition the intendant to repair the\r\nparsonage or the bridge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Confusion in Administration]\r\n\r\nPossibly the reader may now begin to realize that confusion was a prime\r\nattribute of the French administrative system. The common people were\r\nnaturally bewildered by the  overlapping functions of Royal Council,\r\nParlement, provincial estates, governors, bailiffs, intendants,\r\nsubintendants, mayors, town councils, and village assemblies. The\r\nsystem, or lack of system, gave rise to corruption and complication\r\nwithout insuring liberty. The most trivial affairs were regulated by\r\noverbearing and exacting royal officials. Everything depended upon the\r\nhonesty and industry or upon the meanness and caprice of these\r\nofficials. Each petty officer transmitted long reports to his superior;\r\nbut the general public was kept in the dark about official matters, and\r\nwas left to guess, as best it could, the reasons for the seemingly\r\nunreasonable acts of the government. If an intendant increased the\r\ntaxes on a village, the ignorant inhabitants blamed it upon official\r\n\"graft\" or favoritism. Or, if hard times prevailed, or if a shaky\r\nbridge broke down, the villagers were prone in any case to find fault\r\nwith the government, for the more mysterious and powerful the\r\ngovernment was, the more likely was it to bear the blame for all ills.\r\n\r\nConfusion in administrative offices was not the only confusion in\r\neighteenth-century France. There was no uniformity or simplicity in\r\nstandards of weight and measure, in coinage, in tolls, in internal\r\ncustoms-duties. But worst of all were the laws and the courts of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Confusion in Laws]\r\n\r\nWhat was lawful in one town was often illegal in a place not five miles\r\ndistant. Almost four hundred sets or bodies of law were in force in\r\ndifferent parts of France. In some districts the old Roman laws were\r\nstill retained; elsewhere laws derived from early German tribes were\r\nenforceable. Many laws were not even in writing; and such as were\r\nwritten were more often in Latin than in French. The result was that\r\nonly unusually learned men knew the law, and common people stumbled\r\nalong in the dark. The laws, moreover, were full of injustice and\r\ncruelty. An offender might have his hand or ear cut off, or his tongue\r\ntorn out; he might be burned with red-hot irons or have molten lead\r\npoured into his flesh. Hanging was an easy death compared to the\r\nlingering torture of having one's bones broken on a wheel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Confusion in Law Courts]\r\n\r\nThe courts were nearly as bad as the laws. There were royal courts,\r\nfeudal courts, church courts, courts of finance, and military courts;\r\nand it was a wise offender who knew before which court he might be\r\ntried. Extremely important cases might be carried on appeal to the\r\nhighest courts of the realm--the Parlements--of which there were\r\nthirteen, headed in honor by that of Paris.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prevalence of Injustice]\r\n\r\nAlthough courts were so plenteous, justice was seldom to be found.\r\nPersons wrongfully accused of crime were tortured until they confessed\r\ndeeds they had never committed. The public was not admitted to trials,\r\nso no one knew on what grounds the sentence was passed, and the judge\r\ngave no reason for his verdict. Civil lawsuits were appealed from court\r\nto court and might drag on for years until the parties had spent all\r\ntheir money. Lawyers were more anxious to extract large fees from their\r\nclients than to secure justice for them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Noblesse de la Robe\"]\r\n\r\nConfused laws and conflicting jurisdictions were often made worse by\r\nthe character of the judges who presided over royal courts. Many of\r\nthem were rich bourgeois who had purchased their appointment from the\r\nking. For a large price it was possible to buy a judgeship or seat in a\r\nParlement, not only for a lifetime but as an hereditary possession. It\r\nhas been estimated that 50,000 bourgeois families possessed such\r\njudicial offices: they formed a sort of lower nobility, exempted from\r\ncertain taxes and very proud of their honors. Naturally envious were\r\nhis neighbors when the \"councilor\" appeared in his grand wig and his\r\nenormous robe of silk and velvet, attended by a page who kept the robe\r\nfrom trailing in the dust. No wonder these bourgeois judges were called\r\n\"the nobility of the robe.\"\r\n\r\nIn some way or other the \"noble of the robe\" had to compensate himself\r\nfor the price of his office and the cost of his robe. One bought an\r\noffice for profit as well as for honor. For to the judge were paid the\r\ncourt fees and fines; and no shrewd judge would let a case pass him\r\nwithout exacting some kind of a fee. Even more profitable were the\r\nindirect gains. If Monsieur A had gained his case in court, it was\r\nquite to be expected that in his joy Monsieur A would make a handsome\r\npresent to the judge who had given the decision. At least, that is the\r\nway the judge would have put it. As a plain matter of fact the judges\r\nwere bribed, and justice was too often bought and sold like judgeships.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abuses in the Army]\r\n\r\nCorruption and abuses were not confined to the civil government and the\r\ncourts of law; the army, too, was infected. In the ranks were to be\r\nfound hired foreigners, unwilling peasants dragged from their farms,\r\nand the scum of the city slums. Thousands deserted every year. Had the\r\ndiscontented troops been well commanded, they might still have answered\r\nthe purpose. But such was not the case. There were certainly enough\r\nofficers--an average of one general for every 157 privates. But what\r\nofficers they were! Dissolute and dandified generals drawing their pay\r\nand never visiting their troops, lieutenants reveling in vice, instead\r\nof drilling and caring for their commands. Noble blood, not ability,\r\nwas the qualification of a commander. Counts, who had never seen a\r\nbattlefield, were given military offices, and the seven-year-old Duc de\r\nFrousac was a colonel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Confusion in Finance]\r\n\r\nConfused administration, antiquated laws, corrupt magistrates, and a\r\ndisorganized army showed the weakness of the French monarchy; but\r\nfinancial disorders threatened its very existence,--for a government\r\nout of money is as helpless as a fish out of water.\r\n\r\nThe destructive wars, costly armies, luxurious palaces, and extravagant\r\ncourt of Louis XIV had left to the successors of the Grand Monarch many\r\ndebts, an empty treasury, and an overtaxed people. If ever there was\r\nneed of care and thrift, it was in the French monarchy in the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\nYet the king's ministers did not even trouble themselves to keep\r\norderly accounts. Bills and receipts were carelessly laid away; no one\r\nknew how much was owed or how much was to be expected by the treasury;\r\nand even the king himself could not have told how much he would run\r\ninto debt during the year. While it lasted, money was spent freely.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Royal Revenue]\r\n\r\nThe amount of money required by the king would have made taxes very\r\nheavy anyway, but bad methods of assessment and collection added to the\r\nburden. The royal revenue was derived chiefly from three sources: the\r\nroyal domains, the direct taxes, and the indirect taxes. From the royal\r\ndomains, the lands of which the king was landlord as well as sovereign,\r\na considerable but ever-diminishing income was derived.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Direct Taxes]\r\n[Sidenote: The Income Tax]\r\n[Sidenote: The Poll Tax]\r\n\r\nThe direct taxes were the prop of the treasury, for they could be\r\nincreased to meet the demand, at least as long as the people would pay.\r\nThere were three direct taxes--the _taille_, the _capitation_, and the\r\n_vingtième_. The _vingtième_, or \"twentieth,\" was a tax on incomes5\r\nper cent [Footnote: Five per cent in theory; in practice in the reign\r\nof Louis XVI it was 11 per cent] on the salary of the judge, on the\r\nrents of the noble, on the earning of the artisan, on the produce of\r\nthe peasant. The clergy were entirely exempted from this tax; the more\r\ninfluential nobles and bourgeois contrived to have their incomes\r\nunderestimated, and the burden fell heaviest on the poorer classes.\r\n_Capitation_ was a general poll or head tax, varying in amount\r\naccording to whichever of twenty-two classes claimed the individual\r\ntaxpayer. Maid-servants, for example, paid annually three _livres_ and\r\ntwelve _sous_. [Footnote: A _livre_ was worth about a _franc_ (20\r\ncents) and a _sou_ was equivalent to one cent.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Taille or Land Tax]\r\n\r\nThe most important and hated direct tax was the _taille_ or land\r\ntax,--practically a tax on peasants alone. The total amount to be\r\nraised was apportioned among the intendants by the Royal Council, and\r\nby the intendants among the villages of their respective districts. At\r\nthe village assembly collectors were elected, who were thereby\r\nauthorized to demand from each villager a share of the tax, according\r\nto his ability to pay. As a result of this method, each villager tried\r\nto appear poor so as to be taxed lightly; whole villages looked run-\r\ndown in order to be held for only a small share; and influential\r\npoliticians often obtained alleviation for parts of the country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indirect Taxes]\r\n[Sidenote: \"Tax Farming\"]\r\n\r\nThe indirect taxes were not so heavy, but they were bitterly detested.\r\nThere were taxes on alcohol, metal-ware, cards, paper, and starch, but\r\nmost disliked of all was that on salt (the _gabelle_). Every\r\nperson above seven years of age was supposed annually to buy from the\r\ngovernment salt-works seven pounds of salt at about ten times its real\r\nvalue. [Footnote: It should be understood, of course, that the\r\n_gabelle_ was higher and more burdensome in some provinces than in\r\nothers.] Only government agents could legally sell salt, and smugglers\r\nwere fined heavily or sent to the galleys. These indirect taxes were\r\nusually \"farmed out,\" that is, in return for a lump sum the government\r\nwould grant to a company of speculators the right to collect what they\r\ncould. These speculators were called \"farmers-general,\"--France could\r\nbe called their farm [Footnote: Etymologically, the French word for\r\nfarm (_ferme_) was not necessarily connected with agriculture, but\r\nsignified a fixed sum (_firma_) paid for a certain privilege, such\r\nas that of collecting a tax.] and money its produce. And they farmed\r\nwell. After paying the government, the \"farmers\" still had millions of\r\nfrancs to distribute as bribes or as presents to great personages or to\r\nretain for themselves. Thus, millions were lost to the treasury.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Burden of Taxation]\r\n\r\nTaxes could not always be raised to cover emergencies, nor collected so\r\nwastefully. The peasants of France were crushed by feudal dues, tithes,\r\nand royal taxes. The bourgeoisie were angered by the income tax, by the\r\nindirect taxes, by the tolls and internal customs, and by the\r\nmonopolistic privileges which the king sold to his favorites. How long\r\nthe unprivileged classes would bear the burden of taxation, while the\r\nnobles and clergy were almost free, no one could tell; but signs of\r\ndiscontent were too patent to be ignored.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV (1643-1715) at the end of his long reign perceived the\r\ndanger. As the aged monarch lay on his deathbed, flushed with fever, he\r\ncalled his five-year-old great-grandson and heir, the future Louis XV,\r\nto the bedside and said: \"My child, you will soon be sovereign of a\r\ngreat kingdom. Do not forget your obligations to God; remember that it\r\nis to Him that you owe all that you are. Endeavor to live at peace with\r\nyour neighbors; do not imitate me in my fondness for war, nor in the\r\nexorbitant expenditure which I have incurred. Take counsel in all your\r\nactions. Endeavor to _relieve the people at the earliest possible\r\nmoment_, and thus to accomplish what, unfortunately, I am unable to\r\ndo myself.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louis XV, 1715-1774]\r\n\r\nIt was good advice. But Louis XV was only a boy, a plaything in the\r\nhands of his ministers. In an earlier chapter [Footnote: See above, pp.\r\n255 f.] we have seen how under the duke of Orleans, who was prince\r\nregent from 1715 to 1723, France entered into war with Spain, and how\r\nfinance was upset by speculation; and how under Cardinal Fleury, who\r\nwas minister from 1726 to 1743, the War of the Polish Election (1733-\r\n1738) was fought and the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748)\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1743 the ninety-year-old Cardinal Fleury died, Louis XV\r\nannounced that he would be his own minister. But he was not a Frederick\r\nthe Great. At the council table poor Louis \"opened his mouth, said\r\nlittle, and thought not at all.\" State business seemed terribly dull,\r\nand the king left most of it to others.\r\n\r\nBut of one thing, Louis XV could not have enough--and that was\r\npleasure. He much preferred pretty girls to pompous ministers of state,\r\nand spent most of his time with the ladies and the rest of the time\r\neither hunting or gambling. In spite of the fact that he was married,\r\nLouis very easily fell in love with a charming face; at one time he was\r\ninfatuated by the duchess of Châteauroux, then by Madame de Pompadour,\r\nand later by Madame du Barry. Upon his mistresses he was willing to\r\nlavish princely presents,--he gave them estates and titles, had them\r\nlive at Versailles, and criminally allowed them to interfere in\r\npolitics; for their sake he was willing to let his country go to ruin.\r\n\r\nThe character of the king was reflected in his court. It became\r\nfashionable to neglect one's wife, to gamble all night, to laugh at\r\nvirtue, to be wasteful and extravagant. Versailles was gay; the ladies\r\npainted their cheeks more brightly than ever, and the lords spent their\r\nfortunes more recklessly.\r\n\r\nBut Versailles was not France. France was ruined with wars and taxes.\r\nLouis XIV had said, \"Live at peace with your neighbors\"; but since his\r\ndeath four wars had been waged, culminating in the disastrous Seven\r\nYears' War (1756-1763), by which French commerce had been destroyed and\r\nthe French colonies had been lost. [Footnote: The formal annexation of\r\nLorraine in 1766 and of Corsica in 1768 afforded some crumbs of comfort\r\nfor Louis XV.] Debts were multiplied and taxes increased. What with\r\nwar, extravagance, and poor management, Louis XV left France a bankrupt\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Growing complaints against the French Monarchy under Louis\r\nXV]\r\n\r\nComplaints were loud and remonstrances bitter, and Louis XV could not\r\nsilence them, try as he might. Authors who criticized the government\r\nwere thrown into prison: radical writings were confiscated or burned;\r\nbut criticism persisted. Enemies of the government were imprisoned\r\nwithout trial in the Bastille by _lettres de cachet_, which were\r\norders for arrest signed in blank by the king, who sometimes gave or\r\nsold them to his favorites, so that they, too, might have their enemies\r\njailed. Yet the opposition to the court ever increased. Resistance to\r\ntaxation centered in the Parlement of Paris. It refused to register the\r\nking's decrees, and remained defiant even after Louis XV had angrily\r\nannounced that he would not tolerate interference with his\r\nprerogatives. The quarrel grew so bitter that all the thirteen\r\nParlements of France were suppressed (1771), and in their stead new\r\nroyal courts were established.\r\n\r\nOpposition was only temporarily crushed; and Louis XV knew that graver\r\ntrouble was brewing. He grew afraid to ride openly among the\r\ndiscontented crowds of Paris; the peasants saluted him sullenly; the\r\ntreasury was empty; the monarchy was tottering. Yet Louis XV felt\r\nneither responsibility nor care. \"It will surely last as long as I,\" he\r\ncynically affirmed; \"my successor may take care of himself.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louis XVI, 1774-1792]\r\n\r\nHis successor was his grandson, Louis XVI (1774-1792), a weak-kneed\r\nprince of twenty years, very virtuous and well-meaning, but lacking in\r\nintelligence and will-power. He was too awkward and shy to preside with\r\ndignity over the ceremonious court; he was too stupid and lazy to\r\ndominate the ministry. He liked to shoot deer from out the palace\r\nwindow, or to play at lock-making in his royal carpentry shop.\r\nGovernment he left to his ministers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Turgot]\r\n\r\nAt first, hopes ran high, for Turgot, friend of Voltaire and\r\ncontributor to the _Encyclopedia_, was minister of finance (1774-\r\n1776), and reform was in the air. Industry and commerce were to be\r\nunshackled; _laisser-faire_ was to be the order of the day;\r\nfinances were to be reformed, and taxes lowered. The clergy and nobles\r\nwere no longer to escape taxation; taxes on food were to be abolished;\r\nthe peasants were to be freed from forced labor on the roads. But\r\nTurgot only stirred up opposition. The nobles and clergy were not\r\nanxious to be taxed; courtiers resented any reduction of their\r\npensions; tax-farmers feared the reforming minister; owners of\r\nindustrial monopolies were frightened; the peasants misunderstood his\r\nintentions; and riots broke out. Everybody seemed to be relieved when,\r\nin 1776, Turgot was dismissed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Necker]\r\n\r\nTurgot had been a theorist; his successor was a businessman. Jacques\r\nNecker was well known in Paris as a hard-headed Swiss banker, and\r\nMadame Necker's receptions were attended by the chief personages of the\r\nbourgeois society of Paris. During his five years in office (1776-1781)\r\nNecker applied business methods to the royal finances. He borrowed\r\n400,000,000 francs from his banker friends, reformed the collection of\r\ntaxes, reduced expenditures, and carefully audited the accounts. In\r\n1781 he issued a report or \"Account Rendered of the Financial\r\nCondition.\" The bankers were delighted; the secrets of the royal\r\ntreasury were at last common property; [Footnote: _The Compte\r\nRendu_, as it was called in France, was really not accurate; Necker,\r\nin order to secure credit for his financial administration, made\r\nmatters appear better than they actually were.] and Necker was praised\r\nto the skies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marie Antoinette]\r\n\r\nWhile Necker's Parisian friends rejoiced, his enemies at court prepared\r\nhis downfall. Now the most powerful enemy of Necker's reforms and\r\neconomies was the queen, Marie Antoinette. She was an Austrian\r\nprincess, the daughter of Maria Theresa, and in the eyes of the French\r\npeople she always remained a hated foreigner--\"the Austrian,\" they\r\ncalled her--the living symbol of the ruinous alliance between Habsburgs\r\nand Bourbons which had been arranged by a Madame de Pompadour and which\r\nhad contributed to the disasters and disgrace of the Seven Years' War\r\n[Footnote: See above, pp. 358 ff]. While grave ministers of finance\r\nwere puzzling their heads over the deficit, gay Marie Antoinette was\r\nbuying new dresses and jewelry, making presents to her friends, giving\r\nprivate theatricals, attending horse-races and masked balls. The light-\r\nhearted girl-queen had little serious interest in politics, but when\r\nher friends complained of Necker's miserliness, she at once demanded\r\nhis dismissal.\r\n\r\nHer demand was granted, for the kind-hearted, well-intentioned Louis\r\nXVI could not bear to deprive his pretty, irresponsible Marie\r\nAntoinette and her charming friends,--gallant nobles of France,--of\r\ntheir pleasures. Their pleasures were very costly; and fresh loans\r\ncould be secured by the obsequious new finance-minister, Calonne, only\r\nat high rates of interest.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of France, the greatest folly of Louis XVI's reign\r\nwas the ruinous intervention in the War of American Independence (1778-\r\n1783). The United States became free; Great Britain was humbled;\r\nFrenchmen proved that their valor was equal to their chivalry; but when\r\nthe impulsive Marquis de Lafayette returned from assisting the\r\nAmericans to win their liberty, he found a ruined France. The treasury\r\nwas on the verge of collapse. From the conclusion of the war in 1783 to\r\nthe outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, every possible financial\r\nexpedient was tried--in vain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Problem of Taxation]\r\n\r\nTo tax the so-called privileged classes--the clergy and the nobles--\r\nmight have helped; and successive finance ministers so counseled the\r\nking. But it was absolutely against the spirit of the \"old régime.\"\r\nWhat was the good of being a clergyman or a noble, if one had no\r\nprivileges and was obliged to pay taxes like the rest? To tax all alike\r\nwould be in itself a revolution, and the tottering divine-right\r\nmonarchy sought reform, not revolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Assembly of Notables, 1787]\r\n\r\nYet in 1786 the interest-bearing debt had mounted to $600,000,000, the\r\ngovernment was running in debt at least $25,000,000 a year, and the\r\ntreasury-officials were experiencing the utmost difficulty in\r\nnegotiating new loans. Something had to be done. As a last resort, the\r\nking convened (1787) an Assembly of Notables--145 of the chief nobles,\r\nbishops, and magistrates--in the vain hope that they would consent to\r\nthe taxation of the privileged and unprivileged alike. The Notables\r\nwere not so self-sacrificing, however, and contented themselves with\r\nabolishing compulsory labor on the roads, voting to have provincial\r\nassemblies established, and demanding the dismissal of Calonne, the\r\nminister of finance. The question of taxation, they said, should be\r\nreferred to the Estates-General. All this helped the treasury in no\r\nmaterial way.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Convocation of the Estates-General]\r\n\r\nA new minister of finance, who succeeded Calonne,--Archbishop Loménie\r\nde Brienne,--politely thanked the Notables and sent them home. He made\r\nso many fine promises that hope temporarily revived, and a new loan was\r\nraised. But the Parlement of Paris, which together with the other\r\nParlements had been restored early in the reign of Louis XVI, soon saw\r\nthrough the artifices of the suave minister, and positively refused to\r\nregister further loans or taxes. Encouraged by popular approval, the\r\nParlement went on to draw up a declaration of rights, and to assert\r\nthat subsidies could constitutionally be granted only by the nation's\r\nrepresentatives--the ancient Estates-General. This sounded to the\r\ngovernment like revolution, and the Parlements were again abolished.\r\nThe abolition of the Parlements raised a great cry of indignation;\r\nexcited crowds assembled in Paris and other cities; and the soldiers\r\nrefused to arrest the judges. Here was real revolution, and Louis XVI,\r\nfrightened and anxious, yielded to the popular demand for the Estates-\r\nGeneral.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that every one talked so glibly about the Estates-\r\nGeneral and of the great things that body would do, few knew just what\r\nthe Estates-General was. Most people had heard that once upon a time\r\nFrance had had a representative body of clergy, nobility, and\r\ncommoners, somewhat like the British Parliament. But no such assembly\r\nhad been convoked for almost two centuries, and only scholars and\r\nlawyers knew what the old Estates-General had been. Nevertheless, it\r\nwas believed that nothing else could save France from ruin; and in\r\nAugust, 1788, Louis XVI, after consulting the learned men, issued a\r\nsummons for the election of the Estates-General, to meet in May of the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Failure of Absolutism in France]\r\n\r\nThe convocation of the Estates-General was the death-warrant of divine-\r\nright monarchy in France. It meant that absolutism had failed. The king\r\nwas bankrupt. No half-way reforms or pitiful economies would do now.\r\nThe Revolution was at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL READING\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH MONARCHY, 1760-1800. General accounts: A. L.

They had undergone only such alterations as were\r\nabsolutely necessary to adapt them to various places and changing\r\ncircumstances. Likewise, the same social classes existed as had always\r\ncharacterized western Europe; and these classes--the court, the nobles,\r\nthe clergy, the bourgeoisie, the artisans, the peasants--continued to\r\nbear relations to each other which a hoary antiquity had sanctioned.\r\nEvery individual was born into his class, or, as the popular phrase\r\nwent, to \"a station to which God had called him,\" and to question the\r\nfundamental divine nature of class distinctions seemed silly if not\r\ndownright blasphemous.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dislocation of Society in Eighteenth Century]\r\n\r\nSuch ideas were practical so long as society was comparatively static\r\nand fixed, but they were endangered as soon as the human world was\r\nconceived of as dynamic and progressive. The development of trade and\r\nindustry, as has been emphasized, rapidly increased the numbers,\r\nwealth, and influence of the bourgeoisie, or middle class, and quite\r\nnaturally threw the social machine out of gear. The merchants, the\r\nlawyers, the doctors, the professors, the literary men, began to envy\r\nthe nobles and clergy, and in turn were envied by the poor townsfolk\r\nand by the downtrodden peasants. With the progress of learning and\r\nstudy, thoughtful persons of all classes began to doubt whether the old\r\norder of politics and society was best suited to the new conditions and\r\nnew relations. The \"old régime\" was for old needs; did it satisfy new\r\nrequirements?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of Philosophy]\r\n\r\nTo this question the philosophers of the eighteenth century responded\r\nunequivocally in the negative. Scientists, of whom the period was full,\r\nhad done much to exalt the notions that the universe is run in\r\naccordance with immutable laws of nature and that man must forever\r\nutilize his reasoning faculties. It was not long before the\r\nphilosophers were applying the scientists' notions to social\r\nconditions. \"Is this reasonable?\" they asked, or, \"Is that rational?\"\r\nMontesquieu insisted that divine-right monarchy is unreasonable.\r\nVoltaire poked fun at the Church and the clergy for being irrational.\r\nRousseau claimed that class inequalities have no basis in reason.\r\nBeccaria taught that arbitrary or cruel interference with personal\r\nliberty is not in accordance with dictates of nature or reason.\r\n\r\nPhilosophy did not directly effect a change; it was merely an\r\nexpression of a growing belief in the advisability of change. It\r\nreflected a conviction, deep in many minds, that the old political\r\ninstitutions and social distinctions had served their purpose and\r\nshould now be radically adapted to the new order. Every country in\r\ngreater or less degree heard the radical philosophy, but it was in\r\nFrance that it was first heeded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Revolution]\r\n\r\nIn France, between the years 1789 and 1799, occurred a series of\r\nevents, by which the doctrine of democracy supplanted that of divine-\r\nright monarchy, and the theory of class distinctions gave way to that\r\nof social equality. These events, taken together, constitute what we\r\nterm the French Revolution, and, inasmuch as they have profoundly\r\naffected all political thought and social action throughout the\r\nnineteenth and twentieth centuries, they are styled, by way of\r\neminence, the Revolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Revolution French]\r\n\r\nWhy the Revolution started in France may be suggested by reference to\r\ncertain points which have already been mentioned in the history of that\r\ncountry. France was the country which, above any other, had perfected\r\nthe theory and practice of divine-right monarchy. In France had\r\ndeveloped the sharpest contrasts between the various social classes. It\r\nwas likewise in France that the relatively high level of education and\r\nenlightenment had given great vogue to a peculiarly destructive\r\ncriticism of political and social conditions. Louis XIV had erected his\r\nabsolutism and had won for it foreign glory and prestige only by\r\nplacing the severest burdens upon the French people. The exploitation\r\nof the state by the selfish, immoral Louis XV had served not to lighten\r\nthose burdens but rather to set forth in boldest relief the inherent\r\nweaknesses of the \"old régime.\" And Louis XVI, despite all manner of\r\npious wishes and good intentions, had been unable to square conditions\r\nas they were with the operation of antique institutions. One royal\r\nminister after another discovered to his chagrin that mere \"reform\" was\r\nworse than useless. A \"revolution\" would be required to sweep away the\r\nmass of abuses that in the course of centuries had adhered to the body\r\npolitic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Differences between the French and English Revolutions]\r\n\r\nAt the outset, any idea of likening the French Revolution to the\r\nEnglish Revolution of the preceding century must be dismissed. Of\r\ncourse the English had put one king to death and had expelled another,\r\nand had clearly limited the powers of the crown; they had \"established\r\nparliamentary government.\" But the English Revolution did not set up\r\ngenuine representative government, much less did it recognize the\r\ntheory of democracy. Voting remained a special privilege, conferred on\r\ncertain persons, not a natural right to be freely exercised by all. Nor\r\nwas the English Revolution accompanied by a great social upheaval: it\r\nwas in the first instance political, in the second instance religious\r\nand ecclesiastical; it was never distinctly social. To all intents and\r\npurposes, the same social classes existed in the England of the\r\neighteenth century as in the England of the sixteenth century, and,\r\nwith the exception of the merchants, in much the same relation to one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The French Revolution in Two Periods]\r\n\r\nHow radical and far-reaching was the French Revolution in contrast to\r\nthat of England will become apparent as we review the course of events\r\nin France during the decade 1789-1799. A brief summary at the close of\r\nthis chapter will aim to explain the significance of the Revolution.\r\nMeanwhile, we shall devote our attention to a narrative of the main\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nThe story falls naturally into two parts: First, 1789-1791, the\r\ncomparatively peaceful transformation of the absolute, divine-right\r\nmonarchy into a limited monarchy, accompanied by a definition of the\r\nrights of the individual and a profound change in the social order;\r\nsecond, 1792-1799, the transformation of the limited monarchy into a\r\nrepublic, attended by the first genuine trial of democracy, and\r\nattended likewise by foreign war and internal tumult. The story, in\r\neither of its parts, is not an easy one, for the reason that important\r\nrôles are played simultaneously by five distinct groups of interested\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rôle of the Court and the Privileged]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the people who benefit by the political and social\r\narrangements of the \"old régime\" will oppose its destruction. Among\r\nthese friends of the \"old régime\" may be included the royal court,\r\nheaded by the queen, Marie Antoinette, and by the king's brothers, the\r\ncount of Provence and the count of Artois, and likewise the bulk of the\r\nhigher clergy and the nobles--the privileged classes, generally. These\r\npersons cannot be expected to surrender their privileges without a\r\nstruggle, especially since they have been long taught that such\r\nprivileges are of divine sanction. Only dire necessity compels them to\r\nacquiesce in the convocation of the Estates-General and only the\r\nmildest measures of reform can be palatable to them. They hate and\r\ndread revolution or the thought of revolution. Yet at their expense the\r\nRevolution will be achieved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rôle of the Bourgeoisie]\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the bourgeoisie, who have the most to lose if the\r\n\"old régime\" is continued and the most to gain if reforms are obtained,\r\nwill constitute the majority in all the legislative bodies which will\r\nassemble in France between 1789 and 1799. Their legislative decrees\r\nwill in large measure reflect their class interests, and on one hand\r\nwill terrify the court party and on the other will not fully satisfy\r\nthe lower classes. The real achievements of the Revolution, however,\r\nwill be those of the bourgeois assemblies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rôle of the Urban Proletariat]\r\n\r\nIn the third place, the artisans and poverty-stricken populace of the\r\ncities, notably of Paris, will through bitter years lack for bread.\r\nThey will expect great things from the assemblies and will revile the\r\nefforts of the court to impede the Revolution. They will shed blood at\r\nfirst to defend the freedom of the assemblies from the court,\r\nsubsequently to bring the assemblies under their own domination.\r\nWithout their cooperation the Revolution will not be achieved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rôle of the Peasantry]\r\n\r\nIn the fourth place, the dull, heavy peasants, in whom no one has\r\nhitherto suspected brains or passions, long dumb under oppression, will\r\nnow find speech and opinions and an unwonted strength. They will rise\r\nagainst their noble oppressors and burn castles and perhaps do murder.\r\nThey will force the astonished bourgeoisie and upper classes to take\r\nnotice of them and indirectly they will impress a significant social\r\ncharacter upon the achievements of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rôle of the Foreign Powers]\r\n\r\nFinally, the foreign monarchs must be watched, for they will be\r\nintensely interested in the story as it unfolds. If the French people\r\nbe permitted with impunity to destroy the very basis of divine-right\r\nmonarchy and to overturn the whole social fabric of the \"old régime,\"\r\nhow long, pray, will it be before Prussians, or Austrians, or Russians\r\nshall be doing likewise? With some thought for Louis XVI and a good\r\ndeal of thought for themselves, the monarchs will call each other\r\n\"brother\" and will by and by send combined armies against the\r\nrevolutionaries in France. At that very time the success of the\r\nRevolution will be achieved, for all classes, save only the handful of\r\nthe privileged, will unite in the cause of France, which incidentally\r\nbecomes the cause of humanity. Bourgeoisie, townsfolk, peasants, will\r\ngo to the front and revolutionary France will then be found in her\r\narmies. Thereby not only will the Revolution be saved in France, but in\r\nthe end it will be communicated to the uttermost parts of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END OF ABSOLUTISM IN FRANCE, 1789\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: France on the Eve of the Revolution]\r\n\r\nWhen the story opens, France is still the absolute, divine-right\r\nmonarchy which Louis XIV had perfected and Louis XV had exploited. The\r\nsocial classes are still in the time-honored position which has been\r\ndescribed in Chapter XIII. But all is not well with the \"old régime.\"\r\nIn the country districts the taxes are distressingly burdensome. In the\r\ncities there is scarcity of food side by side with starvation wages.\r\nAmong the bourgeoisie are envy of the upper classes, an appreciation of\r\nthe critical philosophy of the day, and a sincere admiration of what\r\nseem to be happier political and social conditions across the Channel\r\nin Great Britain. The public debt of France is enormous, and a large\r\npart of the national income must, therefore, be applied to the payment\r\nof interest: even the courtiers of Louis XVI find their pensions and\r\nfavors and sinecures somewhat reduced. When the privileged classes\r\nbegin to feel the pinch of hard times, it is certain that the finances\r\nare in sore straits.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Financial Embarrassment]\r\n\r\nIn fact, all the great general causes of the French Revolution, which\r\nmay be inferred from the two preceding chapters, may be narrowed down\r\nto the financial embarrassment of the government of Louis XVI. The king\r\nand his ministers had already had recourse to every expedient\r\nconsistent with the maintenance of the \"old regime\" save one, and that\r\none--the convocation of the Estates-General--was now to be tried. It\r\nmight be that the representatives of the three chief classes of the\r\nrealm would be able to offer suggestions to the court, whereby the\r\nfinances could be improved and at the same time the divine-right\r\nmonarchy and the divinely ordained social distinctions would be\r\nunimpaired.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Convocation of the Estates-General]\r\n\r\nWith this idea of simple reform in mind, Louis XVI in 1788 summoned the\r\nEstates-General to meet at Versailles the following May. The Estates-\r\nGeneral were certainly not a revolutionary body. Though for a hundred\r\nand seventy-five years the French monarchs had been able to do without\r\nthem, they were in theory still a legitimate part of the old-time\r\ngovernment. Summoned by King Philip the Fair in 1302, they had been\r\nthenceforth convoked at irregular intervals until 1614. Their\r\norganization had been in three separate bodies, representing by\r\nelection the three estates of the realm--clergy, nobility, and\r\ncommoners (Third Estate). Each estate voted as a unit, and two out of\r\nthe three estates were sufficient to carry a measure. It usually\r\nhappened that the clergy and nobility joined forces to outvote the\r\ncommoners. The powers of the Estates-General had always been advisory\r\nrather than legislative, and the kings had frequently ignored or\r\nviolated the enactments of the assembly. In its powers as well as in\r\nits organization, the Estates-General differed essentially from the\r\nParliament of England. By the Estates-General the ultimate supremacy of\r\nthe royal authority had never been seriously questioned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Election of the Estates-General]\r\n\r\nThe elections to the Estates-General were held in accordance with\r\nancient usage throughout France in the winter of 1788-1789. Also, in\r\naccordance with custom, the electors were invited by the king to\r\nprepare reports on the condition of the locality with which they were\r\nfamiliar and to indicate what abuses, if any, existed, and what\r\nremedies, in their opinion, were advisable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Cahiers]\r\n\r\nBy the time the elections were complete, it was apparent that the\r\nmajority of the French people desired and expected a greater measure of\r\nreform than their sovereign had anticipated. The reports and lists of\r\ngrievances that had been drafted in every part of the country were\r\nastounding. To be sure, these documents, called _cahiers_, were\r\nnot revolutionary in wording: with wonderful uniformity they expressed\r\nloyalty to the monarchy and fidelity to the king: in not a single one\r\nout of the thousand _cahiers_ was there a threat of violent\r\nchange. But in spirit the _cahiers_ were eloquent. All of them\r\nreflected the idea which philosophy had made popular that reason\r\ndemanded fundamental, thoroughgoing reforms in government and society.\r\nThose of the Third Estate were particularly insistent upon the social\r\ninequalities and abuses long associated with the \"old régime.\" It was\r\nclear that if the elected representatives of the Third Estate carried\r\nout the instructions of their constituents, the voting of additional\r\ntaxes to the government would be delayed until a thorough investigation\r\nhad been made and many grievances had been redressed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Third Estate]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it was probable that the elected representatives of the\r\nThird Estate would heed the _cahiers_. They were educated and\r\nbrainy men. Two-thirds of them were lawyers or judges; many, also, were\r\nscholars; only ten could possibly be considered as belonging to the\r\nlower classes. A goodly number admired the governmental system of Great\r\nBritain, in which the royal power had been reduced; the class interests\r\nof all of them were directly opposed to the prevailing policies of the\r\nFrench monarchy. The Third Estate was too intelligent to follow blindly\r\nor unhesitatingly the dictates of the court.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest history of the Estates-General, the Third Estate had\r\nbeen of comparatively slight importance either in society or in\r\npolitics, and Philip the Fair had proclaimed that the duty of its\r\nmembers was \"to hear, receive, approve, and perform what should be\r\ncommanded of them by the king.\" But between the fourteenth and\r\neighteenth centuries the relative social importance of the bourgeoisie\r\nhad enormously increased. The class was more numerous, wealthier, more\r\nenlightened, and more experienced in the conduct of business. It became\r\nclearer with the lapse of time that it, more than nobility or clergy,\r\ndeserved the right of representing the bulk of the nation. This right\r\nLouis XVI had seemed in part to recognize by providing that the number\r\nof elected representatives of the Third Estate should equal the\r\ncombined numbers of those of the First and Second Estates. The\r\ncommoners naturally drew the deduction from the royal concession that\r\nthey were to exercise paramount political influence in the Estates-\r\nGeneral of 1789.\r\n\r\nThe Third Estate, as elected in the winter of 1788-1789, was fortunate\r\nin possessing two very capable leaders, Mirabeau and Sieyès, both of\r\nwhom belonged by office or birth to the upper classes, but who had\r\ngladly accepted election as deputies of the unprivileged classes. With\r\ntwo such leaders, it was extremely doubtful whether the Third Estate\r\nwould tamely submit to playing an inferior role in future.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mirabeau]\r\n\r\nMirabeau (1749-1791) was the son of a bluff but good-hearted old\r\nmarquis who was not very successful in bringing up his family. Young\r\nMirabeau had been so immoral and unruly that his father had repeatedly\r\nobtained _lettres de cachet_ from the king in order that prison\r\nbars might keep him out of mischief. Released many times only to fall\r\ninto new excesses, Mirabeau found at last in the French Revolution an\r\nopportunity for expressing his sincere belief in constitutional\r\ngovernment and an outlet for his almost superhuman energy. From the\r\nconvocation of the Estates-General to his death in 1791, he was one of\r\nthe most prominent men in France. His gigantic physique, half-broken by\r\ndisease and imprisonment, his shaggy eyebrows, his heavy head, gave him\r\nan impressive, though sinister, appearance. And for quickness in\r\nperceiving at once a problem and its solution, as well as for gifts of\r\nreverberating oratory, he was unsurpassed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sieyès]\r\n\r\nOf less force but greater tact was the priest, Sieyès (1748-1836),\r\nwhose lack of devotion to Christianity and the clerical calling was\r\nmatched by a zealous regard for the skeptical and critical philosophy\r\nof the day and for the practical arts of politics and diplomacy. It was\r\na pamphlet of Sieyès that, on the eve of the assembling of the Estates-\r\nGeneral, furnished the Third Estate with its platform and program.\r\n\"What is the Third Estate?\" asks Sieyès. \"It is everything,\" he\r\nreplies. \"What has it been hitherto in the political order? Nothing!\r\nWhat does it desire? To be something!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Meeting of the Estates-General (May, 1789)]\r\n[Sidenote: Constitutional Question Involved in the Organization of the\r\nEstates-General]\r\n\r\nThe position of the Third Estate was still officially undefined when\r\nthe Estates-General assembled at Versailles in May, 1789. The king\r\nreceived his advisers with pompous ceremony and a colorless speech, but\r\nit was soon obvious that he and the court intended that their business\r\nshould be purely financial and that their organization should be in\r\naccordance with ancient usage; the three estates would thus vote \"by\r\norder,\" that is, as three distinct bodies, so that the doubled\r\nmembership of the Third Estate would have but one vote to the\r\nprivileged orders' two. With this view the great majority of the nobles\r\nand a large part of the clergy, especially the higher clergy, were in\r\nfull sympathy. On their side the commoners began to argue that the\r\nEstates-General should organize itself as a single body, in which each\r\nmember should have one vote, such voting \"by head\" marking the\r\nestablishment of true representation in France, and that the assembly\r\nshould forthwith concern itself with a general reformation of the\r\nentire government. With the commoners' argument a few of the liberal\r\nnobles, headed by Lafayette, and a considerable group of the clergy,\r\nparticularly the curates, agreed; and it was backed up by the undoubted\r\nsentiment of the nation. Bad harvests in 1788 had been followed by an\r\nunusually severe winter. The peasantry was in an extremely wretched\r\nplight, and the cities, notably Paris, suffered from a shortage of\r\nfood. The increase of popular distress, like a black cloud before a\r\nstorm, gave menacing support to the demands of the commoners.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The King Defied by the Third Estate]\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Oath of the Tennis Court,\" 20 June, 1789]\r\n\r\nOver the constitutional question, fraught as it was with the most\r\nsignificant consequences to politics and society, the parties wrangled\r\nfor a month. The king, unwilling to offend any one, shilly-shallied.\r\nBut the uncompromising attitude of the privileged orders and the\r\nindecision of the leaders of the court at length forced the issue. On\r\n17 June, 1789, the Third Estate solemnly proclaimed itself a National\r\nAssembly. Three days later, when the deputies of the Third Estate came\r\nto the hall which had been set apart in the palace of Versailles for\r\ntheir use, they found its doors shut and guarded by troops and a notice\r\nto the effect that it was undergoing repairs. Apparently the king was\r\nat last preparing to intervene in the contest himself. Then the\r\ncommoners precipitated a veritable revolution. Led by Mirabeau and\r\nSieyès, they proceeded to a great public building in the vicinity,\r\nwhich was variously used as a riding-hall or a tennis court. There,\r\namidst intense excitement, with upstretched hands, they took an oath as\r\nmembers of the \"National Assembly\" that they would not separate until\r\nthey had drawn up a constitution for France. The \"Oath of the Tennis\r\nCourt\" was the true beginning of the French Revolution. Without royal\r\nsanction, in fact against the express commands of the king, the ancient\r\nfeudal Estates-General had been transformed, by simple proclamation of\r\nthe nation's representatives, into a National Assembly, charged with\r\nthe duty of establishing constitutional government in France. The \"Oath\r\nof the Tennis Court\" was the declaration of the end of absolute divine-\r\nright monarchy and of the beginning of a limited monarchy based on the\r\npopular will.\r\n\r\nWhat would the king do under these circumstances? He might overwhelm\r\nthe rebellious commoners by force of arms. But that would not solve his\r\nfinancial problems, nor could he expect the French nation to endure it.\r\nIt would likely lead to a ruinous civil war. The only recourse left\r\nopen to him was a game of bluff. He ignored the \"Oath of the Tennis\r\nCourt,\" and with majestic mien commanded the estates to sit separately\r\nand vote \"by order.\" But the commoners were not to be bluffed. Now\r\njoined by a large number of clergy and a few nobles, they openly defied\r\nthe royal authority. In the ringing words of Mirabeau, they expressed\r\ntheir rebellion: \"We are here by the will of the people and we will not\r\nleave our places except at the point of the bayonet.\" The weak-kneed,\r\nwell-intentioned Louis XVI promptly acquiesced. Exactly one week after\r\nthe scene in the tennis court, he reversed his earlier decrees and\r\ndirected the estates to sit together and vote \"by head.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Transformation of the Estates-General into the National\r\nConstituent Assembly]\r\n\r\nBy 1 July, 1789, the first stage in the Revolution was completed. The\r\nnobles and clergy were meeting with the commoners. The Estates-General\r\nhad become the National Constituent Assembly. As yet, however, two\r\nimportant questions remained unanswered. In the first place, how would\r\nthe Assembly be assured of National freedom from the intrigues and\r\narmed force of the court? In the second place, what direction would the\r\nreforms of the Assembly take?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Court Prepares to Use Force against the Assembly]\r\n\r\nThe answer to the first question was speedily evoked by the court\r\nitself. As early as 1 July, a gradual movement of royal troops from the\r\ngarrisons along the eastern frontier toward Paris and Versailles made\r\nit apparent that the king contemplated awing the National Assembly into\r\na more deferential mood. The Assembly, in dignified tone, requested the\r\nremoval of the troops. The king responded by a peremptory refusal and\r\nby the dismissal of Necker [Footnote: Necker had been restored to his\r\noffice as director-general of finances in 1788] the popular finance-\r\nminister. Then it was that Paris came to the rescue of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Popular Uprising at Paris in Behalf of the Assembly]\r\n[Sidenote: The Destruction of the Bastille, 14 July, 1789]\r\n\r\nThe Parisian populace, goaded by real want, felt instinctively that its\r\nown cause and that of the National Assembly were identical. Fired by an\r\neloquent harangue of a brilliant journalist, Camille Desmoulins (1760-\r\n1794) by name, they rushed to arms. For three days there was wild\r\ndisorder in the city. Shops were looted, royal officers were expelled,\r\nbusiness was at a standstill. On the third day--14 July, 1789--the mob\r\nsurged out to the east end of Paris, where stood the frowning royal\r\nfortress and prison of the Bastille. Although since the accession of\r\nLouis XVI the Bastille no longer harbored political offenders,\r\nnevertheless it was still regarded as a symbol of Bourbon despotism, a\r\ngrim threat against the liberties of Paris. The people would now take\r\nit and would appropriate its arms and ammunition for use in defense of\r\nthe National Assembly. The garrison of the Bastille was small and\r\ndisheartened, provisions were short, and the royal governor was\r\nirresolute. Within a few hours the mob was in possession of the\r\nBastille, and some of the Swiss mercenaries who constituted its\r\ngarrison had been slaughtered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolution in the Government of Paris: the Commune]\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Bastille was the first serious act of violence in the\r\ncourse of the Revolution. It was an unmistakable sign that the people\r\nwere with the Assembly rather than with the king. It put force behind\r\nthe Assembly's decrees. Not only that, but it rendered Paris\r\npractically independent of royal control, for, during the period of\r\ndisorder, prominent citizens had taken it upon themselves to organize\r\ntheir own government and their own army. The new local government--the\r\n\"commune,\" as it was called--was made up of those elected\r\nrepresentatives of the various sections or wards of Paris who had\r\nchosen the city's delegates to the Estates-General. It was itself a\r\nrevolution in city government: it substituted popularly elected\r\nofficials in place of royal agents and representatives of the outworn\r\ngilds. And the authority of the commune was sustained by a popularly\r\nenrolled militia, styled the National Guard, which soon numbered 48,000\r\nchampions of the new cause.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Temporary Acquiescence of the King]\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Bastille was such a clear sign that even Louis XVI did\r\nnot fail to perceive its meaning. He instantly withdrew the royal\r\ntroops and recalled Necker. He recognized the new government of Paris\r\nand confirmed the appointment of the liberal Lafayette to command the\r\nNational Guard. He visited Paris in person, praised what he could not\r\nprevent, and put on a red-white-and-blue cockade--combining the red and\r\nblue of the capital city with the white of the Bourbons--the new\r\nnational tricolor of France. Frenchmen still celebrate the fourteenth\r\nof July, the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille, as the\r\nindependence day of the French nation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Renewed Intrigues of the Royal Family against the Assembly]\r\n\r\nFor a while it seemed as though reform might now go forward without\r\nfurther interruption. The freedom of the Assembly had been affirmed and\r\nupheld. Paris had settled down once more into comparative repose. The\r\nking had apparently learned his lesson. But the victory of the\r\nreformers had been gained too easily. Louis XVI might take solemn oaths\r\nand wear strange cockades, but he remained in character essentially\r\nweak. His very virtues--good intentions, love of wife, loyalty to\r\nfriends--were continually abused. The queen was bitterly opposed to the\r\nreforming policies of the National Assembly and actively resented any\r\ndiminution of royal authority. Her clique of court friends and\r\nfavorites disliked the decrease of pensions and amusements to which\r\nthey had long been accustomed. Court and queen made common cause in\r\nappealing to the good qualities of Louis XVI. What was the weak king to\r\ndo under the circumstances? He was to fall completely under the\r\ndomination of his entourage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Demonstrations of the Parisian Women at Versailles, October,\r\n1789]\r\n\r\nThe result was renewed intrigues to employ force against the\r\nobstreperous deputies and their allies, the populace of Paris. This\r\ntime it was planned to bring royal troops from the garrisons in\r\nFlanders. And on the night of 1 October, 1789, a supper was given by\r\nthe officers of the bodyguard at Versailles in honor of the arriving\r\nsoldiers. Toasts were drunk liberally and royalist songs were sung.\r\nNews of the \"orgy,\" as it was termed, spread like wildfire in Paris,\r\nwhere hunger and suffering were more prevalent than ever. That city was\r\nstarving while Versailles was feasting. The presence of additional\r\ntroops at Versailles, it was believed, would not only put an end to the\r\nindependence of the Assembly but would continue the starvation of\r\nParis. More excited grew the Parisians.\r\n\r\nOn 5 October was presented a strange and uncouth spectacle. A long line\r\nof the poorest women of Paris, including some men dressed as women,\r\nriotous with fear and hunger and rage, armed with sticks and clubs,\r\nscreaming \"Bread! bread! bread!\" were straggling along the twelve miles\r\nof highway from Paris to Versailles. They were going to demand bread of\r\nthe king. Lafayette and his National Guardsmen, who had been unable or\r\nunwilling to allay the excitement in Paris, marched at a respectful\r\ndistance behind the women out to Versailles.\r\n\r\nBy the time Lafayette reached the royal palace, the women were\r\nsurrounding it, howling and cursing, and demanding bread or blood; only\r\nthe fixed bayonets of the troops from Flanders had prevented them from\r\ninvading the building, and even these regular soldiers were weakening.\r\nLafayette at once became the man of the hour. He sent the soldiers back\r\nto the barracks and with his own force undertook the difficult task of\r\nguarding the property and lives of the royal family and of feeding and\r\nhousing the women for the night. Despite his precautions, it was a wild\r\nnight. There was continued tumult in the streets and, at one time,\r\nshortly before dawn, a gang of rioters actually broke into the palace\r\nand groped about in search of the queen's apartments. Just in the nick\r\nof time the hated Marie Antoinette hurried to safer quarters, although\r\nseveral of her personal bodyguard were killed in the mêlée.\r\n\r\nWhen the morning of 6 October had come, Lafayette addressed the crowd,\r\npromising them that they should be provided for, and, at the critical\r\nmoment, there appeared at his side on the balcony of the palace the\r\nroyal family--the king, the little prince, the little princess, and the\r\nqueen--all wearing red-white-and-blue cockades. A hush fell upon the\r\nmob. The respected general leaned over and gallantly kissed the hand of\r\nMarie Antoinette. A great shout of joy went up. Apparently even the\r\nqueen had joined the Revolution. The Parisians were happy, and\r\narrangements were made for the return journey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Forcible Removal of the Court and Assembly from Versailles\r\nto Paris]\r\n\r\nThe procession of 6 October from Versailles to Paris was more curious\r\nand more significant than that of the preceding day in the opposite\r\ndirection. There were still the women and the National Guardsmen and\r\nLafayette on his white horse and a host of people of the slums, but\r\nthis time in the midst of the throng was a great lumbering coach, in\r\nwhich rode Louis and his wife and children, for Paris now insisted that\r\nthe court should no longer possess the freedom of Versailles in which\r\nto plot unwatched against the rights of the French people. All along\r\nthe procession reechoed the shout, \"We have the baker and the baker's\r\nwife and the little cook-boy--now we shall have bread.\" And so the\r\ncourt of Louis XVI left forever the proud, imposing palace of\r\nVersailles, and came to humbler lodgings [Footnote: In the palace of\r\nthe Tuileries.] in the city of Paris.\r\n\r\nParis had again saved the National Assembly from royal intimidation,\r\nand the Assembly promptly acknowledged the debt by following the king\r\nto that city. After October, 1789, not reactionary Versailles but\r\nradical Paris was at once the scene and the impulse of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe \"Fall of the Bastille\" and the \"March of the Women to Versailles\"\r\nwere the two picturesque events which assured the independence of the\r\nNational Assembly from the armed force and intrigue of the court.\r\nMeanwhile, the answer to the other question which we propounded above,\r\n\"What direction would the reforms of the Assembly take?\" had been\r\nsupplied by the people at large.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disintegration of the Old Régime throughout France]\r\n[Sidenote: Peasant Reprisals against the Nobility]\r\n\r\nEver since the assembling of the Estates-General, ordinary\r\nadministration of the country had been at a standstill. The people,\r\nexpecting great changes, refused to pay the customary taxes and\r\nimposts, and the king, for fear of the National Assembly and of a\r\npopular uprising, hesitated to compel tax collection by force of arms.\r\nThe local officials did not know whether they were to obey the Assembly\r\nor the king. In fact, the Assembly was for a time so busy with\r\nconstitutional questions that it neglected to provide for local\r\ngovernment, and the king was always timorous. So, during the summer of\r\n1789, the institutions of the \"old régime\" disappeared throughout\r\nFrance, one after another, because there was no popular desire to\r\nmaintain them and no competent authority to enforce them. The\r\ninsurrection in Paris and the fall of the Bastille was the signal in\r\nJuly for similar action elsewhere: other cities and towns substituted\r\nnew elective officers for the ancient royal or gild agents and\r\norganized National Guards of their own. At the same time the direct\r\naction of the people spread to the country districts. In most provinces\r\nthe oppressed peasants formed bands which stormed and burned the\r\nchâteaux of the hated nobles, taking particular pains to destroy feudal\r\nor servile title-deeds. Monasteries were often ransacked and pillaged.\r\nA few of the unlucky lords were murdered, and many others were driven\r\ninto the towns or across the frontier. Amid the universal confusion,\r\nthe old system of local government completely collapsed. The intendants\r\nand governors quitted their posts. The ancient courts of justice,\r\nwhether feudal or royal, ceased to act. The summer of 1789 really ended\r\nFrench absolutism, and the transfer of the central government from\r\nVersailles to Paris in October merely confirmed an accomplished fact.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Revolution Social as well as Political]\r\n\r\nWhatever had been hitherto the reforming policies of the National\r\nAssembly, the deputies henceforth faced facts rather than theories.\r\nRadical social readjustments were now to be effected along with purely\r\ngovernmental and administrative changes. The Revolution was to be\r\nsocial as well as political.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE OLD RÉGIME: THE NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, 1789-1791\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Achievements of the National Assembly, 1789-1791]\r\n\r\nBy the transformation of the Estates-General into the National\r\nConstituent Assembly, France had become to all intents and purposes a\r\nlimited monarchy, in which supreme authority was vested in the nation's\r\nelected representatives. From October, 1789, to September, 1791, this\r\nAssembly was in session in Paris, endeavoring to bring order out of\r\nchaos and to fashion a new France out of the old that was dying of\r\nexhaustion and decrepitude. Enormous was the task, but even greater\r\nwere the achievements. Although the work of the Assembly during the\r\nperiod was influenced in no slight degree by the Parisian populace,\r\nnevertheless it was attended by comparative peace and security. And the\r\nwork done was by far the most vital and most lasting of the whole\r\nrevolutionary era.\r\n\r\nLeaving out of consideration for the time the frightened royal family,\r\nthe startled noblemen and clergy, the determined peasantry, and the\r\nexcited townsfolk, and not adhering too closely to chronological order,\r\nlet us center our attention upon the National Assembly and review its\r\nmajor acts during those momentous years, 1789-1791.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1. Legal Destruction of Feudalism and Serfdom]\r\n\r\nThe first great work of the Assembly was the legal destruction of\r\nfeudalism and serfdom--a long step in the direction of social equality.\r\nWe have already noticed how in July while the Assembly was still at\r\nVersailles, the royal officers in the country districts had ceased to\r\nrule and how the peasants had destroyed many _châteaux_ amid\r\nscenes of unexpected violence. News of the rioting and disorder came to\r\nthe Assembly from every province and filled its members with the\r\nliveliest apprehension. A long report, submitted by a special\r\ninvestigating committee on 4 August, 1789, gave such harrowing details\r\nof the popular uprising that every one was convinced that something\r\nshould be done at once.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The August Days\"]\r\n\r\nWhile the Assembly was debating a declaration which might calm revolt,\r\none of the nobles--a relative of Lafayette--arose in his place and\r\nstated that if the peasants had attacked the property and privileges of\r\nthe upper classes, it was because such property and privileges\r\nrepresented unjust inequality, that the fault lay there, and that the\r\nremedy was not to repress the peasants but to suppress inequality. It\r\nwas immediately moved and carried that the Assembly should proclaim\r\nequality of taxation for all classes and the suppression of feudal and\r\nservile dues. Then followed a scene almost unprecedented in history.\r\nNoble vied with noble, and clergyman with clergyman, in renouncing the\r\nvested rights of the \"old régime.\" The game laws were repudiated. The\r\nmanorial courts were suppressed. Serfdom was abolished. Tithes and all\r\nsorts of ecclesiastical privilege were sacrificed. The sale of offices\r\nwas discontinued. In fact, all special privileges, whether of classes,\r\nof cities, or of provinces, were swept away in one consuming burst of\r\nenthusiasm. The holocaust lasted throughout the night of the fourth of\r\nAugust. Within a week the various independent measures had been\r\nconsolidated into an impressive decree \"abolishing the feudal system,\"\r\nand this decree received in November the royal assent. What many\r\nreforming ministers had vainly labored for years partially to\r\naccomplish was now done, at least in theory, by the National Assembly\r\nin a few days. The so-called \"August Days\" promised to dissolve the\r\nancient society of France.\r\n\r\nIt has been customary to refer these vast social changes to the\r\nenthusiasm, magnanimity, and self-sacrifice of the privileged orders.\r\nThat there was enthusiasm is unquestionable. But it may be doubted\r\nwhether the nobles and clergy were so much magnanimous as terrorized.\r\nFor the first time, they were genuinely frightened by the peasants, and\r\nit is possible that the true measure of their \"magnanimity\" was their\r\nalarm. Then, too, if one is to sacrifice, he must have something to\r\nsacrifice. At most, the nobles had only legal claims to surrender, for\r\nthe peasants had already taken forcible possession of nearly everything\r\nwhich the decree accorded them. In fact the decree of the Assembly\r\nconstituted merely a legal and uniform recognition of accomplished\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nThe nobles may have thought, moreover, that liberal acquiescence in the\r\nfirst demands of the peasantry would save themselves from further\r\ndemands. At any rate, they zealously set to work in the Assembly to\r\nmodify what had been done, to secure financial or other indemnity,\r\n[Footnote: The general effect of the series of decrees of the Assembly\r\nfrom 5 to 11 August, 1789, was to impose some kind of financial\r\nredemption for many of the feudal dues. It was only in July, 1793,\r\nalmost four years after the \"August Days,\" that _all_ feudal dues\r\nand rights were legally abolished without redemption or compensation.]\r\nand to prevent the enactment of additional social legislation. Outside\r\nthe Assembly few nobles took kindly to the loss of privilege and\r\nproperty: the overwhelming majority protested and tried to stir up\r\ncivil war, and, when such attempts failed, they left France and\r\nenrolled themselves among their country's enemies.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary for us to know precisely who were responsible for\r\nthe \"August Days.\" The fact remains that the \"decree abolishing the\r\nfeudal system\" represented the most important achievement of the whole\r\nFrench Revolution. Henceforth, those who profited by the decree were\r\nloyal friends of the Revolution, while the losers were its bitter\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 2. The Declaration of the Rights of Man]\r\n\r\nThe second great work of the Assembly was the guarantee of individual\r\nrights and liberties. The old society and government of France were\r\ndisappearing. On what basis should the new be erected? Great Britain\r\nhad its _Magna Carta_ and its Bill of Rights; America had its\r\nDeclaration of Independence. France was now given a \"Declaration of the\r\nRights of Man and of the Citizen.\" This document, which reflected the\r\nspirit of Rousseau's philosophy and incorporated some of the British\r\nand American provisions, became the platform of the French Revolution\r\nand tremendously influenced political thought in the nineteenth and\r\ntwentieth centuries. A few of its most striking sentences are as\r\nfollows: \"Men are born and remain free and equal in rights.\" The rights\r\nof man are \"liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression.\"\r\n\"Law is the expression of the general will. Every citizen has a right\r\nto participate personally, or through his representative, in its\r\nformation. It must be the same for all.\" \"No person shall be accused,\r\narrested, or imprisoned except in the cases and according to the forms\r\nprescribed by law.\" Religious toleration, freedom of speech, and\r\nliberty of the press are affirmed. The people are to control the\r\nfinances, and to the people all officials of the state are responsible.\r\nFinally, the influence of the propertied classes, which were\r\noverwhelmingly represented in the Assembly, showed itself in the\r\nconcluding section of the Declaration: \"Since private property is an\r\ninviolable and sacred right, no one shall be deprived thereof except\r\nwhere public necessity, legally determined, shall clearly demand it,\r\nand then only on condition that the owner shall have been previously\r\nand equitably indemnified.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 3. Reform of Local Administration]\r\n\r\nThe next great undertaking of the National Assembly was the\r\nestablishment of a new and uniform administrative system in France. The\r\nancient and confusing \"provinces,\" \"governments,\" \"intendancies,\"\r\n\"_pays d'état_\" \"_pays d'élection_\" \"parlements,\" and\r\n\"bailliages\" were swept away. The country was divided anew into eighty-\r\nthree departments, approximately uniform in size and population, and\r\nnamed after natural features, such as rivers or mountains. Each\r\ndepartment was subdivided into districts, cantons. and communes,--\r\ndivisions which have endured in France to the present time. The heads\r\nof the local government were no longer to be appointed by the crown but\r\nelected by the people, and extensive powers were granted to elective\r\nlocal councils. Provision was made for a new system of law courts\r\nthroughout the country, and the judges, like the administrative\r\nofficials, were to be elected by popular vote. Projects were likewise\r\nput forward to unify and simplify the great variety and mass of laws\r\nwhich prevailed in different parts of France, but this work was not\r\nbrought to completion until the time of Napoleon Bonaparte.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 4. Financial Regulation. 5. Secularization of Church\r\nProperty, the Assignats]\r\n\r\nAnother grave matter which concerned the National Assembly was the\r\nregulation of the public finances. It will be recalled that financial\r\nconfusion was the royal reason for summoning the Estates-General. And\r\nin the early days of the Assembly, the confusion became chaos: it was\r\nimpossible to enforce the payment of direct taxes; indirect taxes were\r\ndestroyed by legislative decree; and bankers could not be induced to\r\nmake new loans. Therefore, it was to heroic measures that the Assembly\r\nresorted to save the state from bankruptcy. To provide funds, a heavy\r\nblow was struck at one of the chief props of the \"old régime\"--the\r\nCatholic Church. The Church, as we have seen, owned at least a fifth of\r\nthe soil of France, and it was now resolved to seize these rich church\r\nlands, and to utilize them as security for the issue of paper money--\r\nthe _assignats_. As partial indemnity for the wholesale\r\nconfiscation, the state was to undertake the payment of fixed salaries\r\nto the clergy. Thus by a single stroke the financial pressure was\r\nrelieved, the Church was deprived of an important source of its\r\nstrength, and the clergy were made dependent on the new order. Of\r\ncourse, as often happens in similar cases, the issue of paper money was\r\nso increased that in time it exceeded the security and brought fresh\r\ntroubles to the state, but for the moment the worst dangers were tided\r\nover.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 6. Other Legislation against the Catholic Church]\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical policies and acts of the National Assembly were\r\nperhaps the least efficacious and the most fateful achievements of the\r\nRevolution. Yet it would be difficult to perceive how they could have\r\nbeen less radical than they were. The Church appeared to be\r\nindissolubly linked with the fortunes of old absolutist France; the\r\nclergy comprised a particularly privileged class; and the leaders and\r\ngreat majority of the Assembly were filled with the skeptical, Deistic,\r\nand anti-Christian philosophy of the time. In November, 1789, the\r\nchurch property was confiscated. In February, 1790, the monasteries and\r\nother religious houses were suppressed. In April, absolute religious\r\ntoleration was proclaimed. In August, 1790, the \"Civil Constitution of\r\nthe Clergy\" was promulgated, by which the bishops and priests, reduced\r\nin numbers, were made a civil body: they were to be elected by the\r\npeople, paid by the state, and separated from the sovereign control of\r\nthe pope. In December, the Assembly forced the reluctant king to sign a\r\ndecree compelling all the clergy to take a solemn oath of allegiance to\r\nthe \"Civil Constitution.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Catholic Opposition to the Revolution]\r\n\r\nThe pope, who had already protested against the seizure of church\r\nproperty and the expulsion of the monks, now condemned the \"Civil\r\nConstitution\" and forbade Catholics to take the oath of allegiance.\r\nThus, the issue was squarely joined. Such as took the oath were\r\nexcommunicated by the pope, such as refused compliance were deprived of\r\ntheir salaries and threatened with imprisonment. Up to this time, the\r\nbulk of the lower clergy, poor themselves and in immediate contact with\r\nthe suffering of the peasants, had undoubtedly sympathized with the\r\ncourse of the Revolution, but henceforth their convictions and their\r\nconsciences came into conflict with devotion to their country. They\r\nfollowed their conscience and either incited the peasants, over whom\r\nthey exercised considerable influence, to oppose further revolution, or\r\nemigrated [Footnote: The clergy who would not take the oath were called\r\nthe \"non-juring\" clergy. Those who left France, together with the noble\r\nemigrants, were called \"émigrés.\"] from France to swell the number of\r\nthose who, dissatisfied with the course of events in their own country,\r\nwould seek the first opportunity to undo the work of the Assembly. The\r\nCatholic Church, as well as the hereditary nobility, became an\r\nunwearied opponent of the French Revolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 7. The Constitution of 1791]\r\n\r\nAmid all these sweeping reforms and changes, the National Constituent\r\nAssembly was making steady progress in drafting a written constitution\r\nwhich would clearly define the agencies of government, and their\r\nrespective powers, the new limited monarchy. This constitution was\r\ncompleted in 1791 and signed by the king--he could do nothing else--and\r\nat once went into full effect. It was the first written constitution of\r\nany importance that any European country had had, and was preceded only\r\nslightly in point of time by that of the United States. [Footnote: The\r\npresent American constitution was drafted in 1787 and went into effect\r\nin 1789, the year that the Estates-General assembled.]\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of 1791, as it was called, provided, like the American\r\nconstitution, for the \"separation of powers,\" that is, that the law-\r\nmaking, law-enforcing, and law-interpreting functions of government\r\nshould be kept quite distinct as the legislative, executive, and\r\njudicial departments, and should each spring, in last analysis, from\r\nthe will of the people. This idea had been elaborated by Montesquieu,\r\nand deeply affected the constitution-making of the eighteenth century\r\nboth in France and in the United States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Legislative Provisions]\r\n\r\nThe legislative authority was vested in one chamber, styled the\r\n\"Legislative Assembly,\" the members of which were chosen by means of a\r\ncomplicated system of indirect election. [Footnote: That is to say, the\r\npeople would vote for electors, and the electors for the members of the\r\nAssembly.] The distrust with which the bourgeois framers of the\r\nconstitution regarded the lower classes was shown not only in this\r\ncheck upon direct election but also in the requirements that the\r\nprivilege of voting should be exercised exclusively by \"active\"\r\ncitizens, that is, by citizens who paid taxes, and that the right to\r\nhold office should be restricted to property-holders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Weakness of the King under the Constitution]\r\n\r\nNominally the executive authority resided in the hereditary king. In\r\nthis respect, most of the French reformers thought they were imitating\r\nthe British government, but as a matter of fact they made the kingship\r\nnot even ornamental. True, they accorded to the king the right to\r\npostpone for a time the execution of an act of the legislature--the so-\r\ncalled \"suspensive veto\"--but they deprived him of all control over\r\nlocal government, over the army and navy, and over the clergy. Even his\r\nministers were not to sit in the Assembly. Tremendous had been the\r\ndecline of royal power in France during those two years, 1789-1791.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Summary of the  Work of the National Assembly]\r\n\r\nThis may conclude our brief summary of the work of the National\r\nConstituent Assembly. If we review it as a whole, we are impressed by\r\nthe immense destruction which it effected. No other body of legislators\r\nhas ever demolished so much in the same brief period. The old form of\r\ngovernment, the old territorial divisions, the old financial system,\r\nthe old judicial and legal regulations, the old ecclesiastical\r\narrangements, and, most significant of all, the old condition of\r\nholding land--serfdom and feudalism--all were shattered. Yet all this\r\ndestruction was not a mad whim of the moment. It had been preparing\r\nslowly and painfully for many generations. It was foreshadowed by the\r\nmass of well-considered complaints in the _cahiers_. It was\r\nachieved not only by the decrees of the Assembly, but by the forceful\r\nexpression of the popular will.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIMITED MONARCHY IN OPERATION: THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY (1791-1792)\r\nAND THE OUTBREAK OF FOREIGN WAR\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Brief Duration of Limited Monarchy in France, 1791-1792]\r\n\r\nGreat public rejoicing welcomed the formal inauguration of the limited\r\nmonarchy in 1791. Many believed that a new era of Peace and prosperity\r\nwas dawning for France. Yet the extravagant hopes which were widely\r\nentertained for the success of the new régime were doomed to speedy and\r\nbitter disappointment. The new government encountered all manner of\r\ndifficulties, the country rapidly grew more radical in sentiment and\r\naction, and within a single year the limited monarchy gave way to a\r\nrepublic. The establishment of the republic was the second great phase\r\nof the Revolution. Why it was possible and even inevitable may be\r\ngathered from a survey of political conditions in France during 1792,--\r\nat once the year of trial for limited monarchy and the year of\r\ntransition to the republic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sources of Opposition to the Limited Monarchy]\r\n\r\nBy no means did all Frenchmen accept cheerfully and contentedly the\r\nwork of the National Constituent Assembly. Of the numerous dissenters,\r\nsome thought it went too far and some thought it did not go far enough.\r\nThe former may be styled \"reactionaries\" and the latter \"radicals.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reactionaries]\r\n[Sidenote: 1. The Émigrés]\r\n\r\nThe reactionaries embraced the bulk of the formerly privileged nobility\r\nand the non-juring clergy. The nobles had left France in large numbers\r\nas soon as the first signs of violence appeared--about the time of the\r\nfall of the Bastille and the peasant uprisings in the provinces. Many\r\nof the clergy had similarly departed from their homes when the\r\nanticlerical measures of the Assembly rendered it no longer possible\r\nfor them to follow the dictates of conscience. These reactionary\r\nexiles, or émigrés as they were termed, collected in force along the\r\nnorthern and eastern frontier, especially at Coblenz on the Rhine. They\r\npossessed an influential leader in the king's own brother, the count of\r\nArtois, and they maintained a perpetual agitation, by means of\r\nnewspapers, pamphlets, and intrigues, against the new régime. They were\r\nanxious to regain their privileges and property, and to restore\r\neverything, as far as possible, to precisely the same position it had\r\noccupied prior to 1789.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 2. The Court]\r\n[Sidenote: The Flight to Varennes]\r\n\r\nNor were the reactionaries devoid of support within France. It was\r\nbelieved that the royal family, now carefully watched in Paris,\r\nsympathized with their efforts. So long as Mirabeau, the ablest leader\r\nin the National Assembly, was alive, he had never ceased urging the\r\nking to accept the reforms of the Revolution and to give no countenance\r\nto agitation beyond the frontiers. In case the king should find his\r\nposition in Paris intolerable, he had been advised by Mirabeau to\r\nwithdraw into western or southern France and gather the loyal nation\r\nabout him. But unfortunately, Mirabeau, worn out by dissipation and\r\ncares, died prematurely in April, 1791. Only two months later the royal\r\nfamily attempted to follow the course against which they had been\r\nwarned. Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, in an effort to rid themselves\r\nof the spying vigilance of the Parisians, disguised themselves, fled\r\nfrom the capital, and made straight for the eastern frontier,\r\napparently to join the émigrés. At Varennes, near the border, the royal\r\nfugitives were recognized and turned back to Paris, which henceforth\r\nbecame for them rather a prison than a capital. Although Louis\r\nsubsequently swore a solemn oath to uphold the constitution, his\r\npersonal popularity vanished with his ill-starred flight, and his wife\r\n--the hated \"Austrian woman\"--was suspected with good reason of being\r\nin secret correspondence with the émigrés as well as with foreign\r\ngovernments. Marie Antoinette was more detested than ever. The king's\r\noldest brother, the count of Provence, was more successful than the\r\nking in the flight of June, 1791: he eluded detection and joined the\r\ncount of Artois at Coblenz.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 3. Conservative and Catholic Peasants.]\r\n\r\nHad the reactionaries been restricted entirely to émigrés and the royal\r\nfamily, it is hardly possible that they would have been so troublesome\r\nas they were. They were able, however, to secure considerable popular\r\nsupport in France. A small group in the Assembly shared their views and\r\nproposed the most extravagant measures in order to embarrass the work\r\nof that body. Conservative clubs existed among the upper and well-to-do\r\nclasses in the larger cities. And in certain districts of western\r\nFrance, especially in Brittany, Poitou (La Vendée), and Anjou, the\r\npeasants developed hostility to the course of the Revolution: their\r\nextraordinary devotion to Catholicism placed them under the influence\r\nof the non-juring clergy, and their class feeling against townspeople\r\ninduced them to believe that the Revolution, carried forward by the\r\nbourgeoisie, was essentially in the interests of the bourgeoisie. Riots\r\noccurred in La Vendée throughout 1791 and 1792 with increasing\r\nfrequency until at length the district blazed into open rebellion\r\nagainst the radicals.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Radicals]\r\n[Sidenote: 1. The Bourgeois Leaders]\r\n[Sidenote: 2. The Proletarians]\r\n\r\nMore dangerous to the political settlement of 1791 than the opposition\r\nof the reactionaries was that of the radicals--those Frenchmen who\r\nthought that the Revolution had not gone far enough. The real\r\nexplanation of the radical movement lies in the conflict of interest\r\nbetween the poor working people of the towns and the middle class, or\r\nbourgeoisie. The latter, as has been repeatedly emphasized, possessed\r\nthe brains, the money, and the education: it was they who had been\r\noverwhelmingly represented in the National Assembly. The former were\r\ndegraded, poverty-stricken, and ignorant, but they constituted the bulk\r\nof the population in the cities, notably in Paris, and they were both\r\nconscious of their sorry condition and desperately determined to\r\nimprove it. These so-called \"proletarians,\" though hardly directly\r\nrepresented in the Assembly, nevertheless fondly expected the greatest\r\nbenefits from the work of that body. For a while the bourgeoisie and\r\nthe proletariat coöperated: the former carried reforms through the\r\nAssembly, the latter defended by armed violence the freedom of the\r\nAssembly; both participated in the capture of the Bastille, in the\r\nestablishment of the commune, and in the transfer of the seat of\r\ngovernment from Versailles to Paris. So long as they faced a serious\r\ncommon danger from the court and privileged orders, they worked in\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conflict of Interests Between Bourgeoisie and Proletariat]\r\n\r\nBut as soon as the Revolution had run its first stage and had succeeded\r\nin reducing the royal power and in abolishing many special privileges\r\nof the nobles and clergy, a sharp cleavage became evident between the\r\nformer allies--between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The\r\nbourgeoisie, to whom was due the enactment of the reforms of the\r\nNational Constituent Assembly, profited by those reforms far more than\r\nany other class in the community. Their trade and industry were\r\nstimulated by the removal of the ancient royal and feudal restrictions.\r\nTheir increased wealth enabled them to buy up the estates of the\r\noutlawed émigrés and the confiscated lands of the Church. They secured\r\nan effective control of all branches of government, local and central.\r\nOf course, the peasantry also benefited to no slight extent, but their\r\nbenefits were certainly less impressive than those of the bourgeoisie.\r\nOf all classes in France, the urban proletariat seemed to have gained\r\nthe least: to be sure they were guaranteed by paper documents certain\r\ntheoretical \"rights and liberties,\" but what had been done for their\r\nmaterial well-being? They had obtained no property. They had\r\nexperienced no greater ease in earning their daily bread. And in 1791\r\nthey seemed as far from realizing their hopes of betterment as they had\r\nbeen in 1789, for the bourgeois constitution-makers had provided that\r\nonly taxpayers could vote and only property-owners could hold office.\r\nThe proletariat, thereby cut off from all direct share in the conduct\r\nof government, could not fail to be convinced that in the first phase\r\nof the Revolution they had merely exchanged one set of masters for\r\nanother, that at the expense of the nobles and clergy they had exalted\r\nthe bourgeoisie, and that they themselves were still downtrodden and\r\noppressed. Radical changes in the constitution and radical social\r\nlegislation in their own behalf became the policies of the proletariat;\r\nviolence would be used as a means to an end, if other means failed.\r\n\r\nNot all of the bourgeoisie were thoroughly devoted to the settlement of\r\n1791. Most of them doubtless were. But a thoughtful and conspicuous\r\nminority allied themselves with the proletariat. Probably in many\r\ninstances it was for the selfish motive of personal ambition that this\r\nor that middle-class individual prated much about his love for \"the\r\npeople\" and shed tears over their wretchedness and made all manner of\r\nelection promises to them. But, on the other hand, there were sincere\r\nand altruistic bourgeois who had been converted to the extreme\r\ndemocratic doctrines of Rousseau and who were deeply touched by the\r\nmisery of the lowest classes. It was under the leadership of such men\r\nthat the proletariat grew ever more radical until they sought by force\r\nto establish democracy in France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Center of Radicalism in Paris]\r\n\r\nThe radical movement centered in Paris, where now lived the royal\r\nfamily and where the legislature met. With the object of intimidating\r\nthe former and controlling the latter, the agitation made rapid headway\r\nduring 1791 and 1792. It was conducted by means of inflammatory\r\nnewspapers, coarse pamphlets, and bitter speeches. It appealed to both\r\nthe popular reason and the popular emotions. It was backed up and\r\nrendered efficient by the organization of revolutionary \"clubs.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Clubs]\r\n[Sidenote: Cordeliers and Jacobins]\r\n\r\nThese clubs were interesting centers of political and social agitation.\r\nTheir origin was traceable to the \"eating clubs\" which had been formed\r\nat Versailles by various deputies who desired to take their meals\r\ntogether, but the idea progressed so far that by 1791 nearly every café\r\nin Paris aspired to be a meeting place for politicians and \"patriots.\"\r\nAlthough some of the clubs were strictly constitutional, and even, in a\r\nfew instances, professedly reactionary, nevertheless the greater number\r\nand the most influential were radical. Such were the Cordelier and\r\nJacobin clubs. The former, organized as a \"society of the friends of\r\nthe rights of man and of the citizen,\" was very radical from its\r\ninception and enrolled in its membership the foremost revolutionaries\r\nof Paris. The latter, starting out as a \"society of the friends of the\r\nconstitution,\" counted among its early members such men as Mirabeau,\r\nSieyès, and Lafayette, but subsequently under the leadership of\r\nRobespierre, transformed itself into an organization quite as radical\r\nas the Cordeliers. It is an interesting tact that both these radical\r\nclubs derived their popular names from monasteries, in whose\r\nconfiscated buildings they customarily met.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Radical Propaganda]\r\n\r\nFrom Paris the radical movement radiated in all directions. Pamphlets\r\nand newspapers were spread broadcast. The Jacobin club established a\r\nregular correspondence with branch clubs or kindred societies which\r\nsprang up in other French towns. The radicals were everywhere inspired\r\nby the same zeal and aided by a splendid organization.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Radical Leaders]\r\n\r\nOf the chief radical leaders, it may be convenient at this point to\r\nintroduce three--Marat, Danton, and Robespierre. All belonged to the\r\nbourgeoisie by birth and training, but by conviction they became the\r\nmouthpieces of the proletariat. All played important rôles in\r\nsubsequent scenes of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marat]\r\n\r\nMarat (_c_. 1742-1793), had he never become interested in politics\r\nand conspicuous in the Revolution, might have been remembered in\r\nhistory as a scientist and a man of letters. He had been a physician,\r\nand for skill in his profession, as well as for contributions to the\r\nscience of physics, he had received an honorary degree from St. Andrews\r\nUniversity in Scotland, and for a time he was in the service of the\r\ncount of Artois. The convocation of the Estates-General turned his\r\nattention to public affairs. In repeated and vigorous pamphlets he\r\ncombated the idea then prevalent in France that his countrymen should\r\nadopt a constitution similar to that of Great Britain. During several\r\nyears' sojourn in Great Britain he had observed that that country was\r\nbeing ruled by an oligarchy which, while using the forms of liberty and\r\npretending to represent the country, was in reality using its power for\r\nthe promotion of its own narrow class interests. He made up his mind\r\nthat real reform must benefit all the people alike and that it could be\r\nsecured only by direct popular action. This was the simple message that\r\nfilled the pages of the _Ami du peuple_--the _Friend of the\r\nPeople_--a newspaper which he edited from 1789 to 1792. With fierce\r\ninvective he assailed the court, the clergy, the nobles, even the\r\nbourgeois Assembly. Attached to no party and with no detailed policies,\r\nhe sacrificed almost everything to his single mission. No poverty,\r\nmisery, or persecution could keep him quiet. Forced even to hide in\r\ncellars and sewers, where he contracted a loathsome skin disease, he\r\npersevered in his frenzied appeals to the Parisian populace to take\r\nmatters into their own hands. By 1792 Marat was a man feared and hated\r\nby the authorities but loved and venerated by the masses of the\r\ncapital. [Footnote: Marat was assassinated on 13 July, 1793, by\r\nCharlotte Corday, a young woman who was fanatically attached to the\r\nGirondist faction.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Danton]\r\n\r\nNo less radical but far more statesmanlike was Danton (1759-1794), who\r\nhas been called \"a sort of middle-class Mirabeau.\" The son of a farmer,\r\nhe had studied law, had purchased a position as advocate of the Royal\r\nCouncil, and, before the outbreak of the Revolution, had acquired a\r\nreputation not only as a brilliant young lawyer, but also as a man of\r\nliberal tastes, fond of books, and happy in his domestic life. Like\r\nMirabeau, he was a person of powerful physique and of stentorian voice,\r\na skilled debater and a convincing orator; unlike Mirabeau, he himself\r\nremained calm and self-possessed while arousing his audiences to the\r\nhighest pitch of enthusiasm. Like Mirabeau, too, he was not so\r\nprimarily interested in the welfare of his own social class as in that\r\nof the class below him: what the nobleman Mirabeau was to the\r\nbourgeoisie, the bourgeois Danton was to the Parisian proletariat.\r\nBrought to the fore, through the favor of Mirabeau, in the early days\r\nof the Revolution, Danton at once showed himself a strong advocate of\r\nreal democracy. In 1790, in conjunction with Marat and Camille\r\nDesmoulins, he founded the Cordelier Club, the activities of which he\r\ndirected throughout 1791 and 1792 against the royal family and the\r\nwhole cause of monarchy. An influential member of the commune of Paris,\r\nhe was largely instrumental in crystallizing public opinion in favor of\r\nrepublicanism, Danton was rough and courageous, but neither venal nor\r\nbloodthirsty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Robespierre]\r\n\r\nLess practical than Danton and further removed from the proletariat\r\nthan Marat, Maximilien Robespierre (1758-1794) nevertheless combined\r\nsuch qualities as made him the most prominent exponent of democracy and\r\nrepublicanism. Descended from a middle-class family of Irish\r\nextraction, Robespierre had been a classmate of Camille Desmoulins in\r\nthe law school of the University of Paris, and had practiced law with\r\nsome success in his native town of Arras. He was appointed a criminal\r\njudge, but soon resigned that post because he could not endure to\r\ninflict the death penalty. In his immediate circle he acquired a\r\nreputation as a writer, speaker, and something of a dandy. Elected to\r\nthe Third Estate in 1789, he took his place with the extreme radicals\r\nin that body--the \"thirty voices,\" as Mirabeau contemptuously called\r\nthem. Robespierre had read Rousseau from cover to cover and believed in\r\nthe philosopher's doctrines with all his heart so that he would have\r\ngone to death for them. In the belief that they eventually would\r\nsucceed and regenerate France and all mankind, he was ready to work\r\nwith unwearied patience. The paucity of his followers in the National\r\nAssembly and the overpowering personality of Mirabeau prevented him\r\nfrom exercising much influence in framing the new constitution, and he\r\ngradually turned for support to the people of Paris. He was already a\r\nmember of the Jacobin Club, which, by the withdrawal of its more\r\nconservative members in 1791, came then under his leadership.\r\nThenceforth the Jacobin Club was a most effective instrument for\r\nestablishing social democracy (although it was not committed to\r\nrepublicanism until August, 1792), and Robespierre was its oracle.\r\nRobespierre was never a demagogue in the present sense of the word: he\r\nwas always emphatically a gentleman and a man of culture, sincere and\r\ntruthful. Although he labored strenuously for the \"rights\" of the\r\nproletariat, he never catered to their tastes; to the last day of his\r\nlife he retained the knee-breeches and silk stockings of the old\r\nsociety and wore his hair powdered.\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to understand why the constitutional monarchy\r\nfloundered. It had no great leaders to strengthen it and to conduct it\r\nthrough the narrow strait. It was bound to strike the rocks of reaction\r\non one side or those of radicalism on the other. Against such fearless\r\nand determined assailants as Robespierre, Danton, and Marat, it was\r\nhelpless.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difficulties Confronting the Legislative Assembly, 1791]\r\n\r\nThe new government came into being with the first meeting of the\r\nLegislative Assembly on 1 October, 1791. Immediately its troubles\r\nbegan. The members of the Legislative Assembly were wholly\r\ninexperienced in parliamentary procedure, for an unfortunate self-\r\ndenying ordinance [Footnote: Proposed by Robespierre.] of the retiring\r\nConstituent Assembly had prohibited any of its members from accepting\r\nelection to the new body. The Legislative Assembly contained deputies\r\nof fundamentally diverse views who quarreled long though eloquently\r\namong themselves. Moreover, it speedily came into conflict with the\r\nking, who vainly endeavored to use his constitutional right of\r\nsuspensive veto in order to check its activities. Combined with these\r\nproblems was the popular agitation and excitement: a peasant revolt in\r\nLa Vendée, the angry threats of émigré nobles and non-juring clergy\r\nacross the eastern frontier, the loud tumults of the proletariat of\r\nParis and of other large cities as well.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foreign Hostility to the French Revolution]\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of the limited monarchy were further complicated by an\r\nembarrassing foreign situation. It will be borne in mind that all\r\nimportant European states still adhered rigidly to the social\r\ninstitutions of the \"old régime\" and, with the exception of Great\r\nBritain, to divine-right monarchy. Outside of France there appeared as\r\nyet no such thing as \"public opinion,\" certainly no sign among the\r\nlower classes of any opinion favorable to revolution. In Great Britain\r\nalone was there a constitutional monarchy, and in the early days of the\r\nFrench Revolution, so long as British statesmen could flatter\r\nthemselves that their neighbors across the Channel were striving to\r\nimitate their political system, these same public men sympathized with\r\nthe course of events. But when it became evident that the Revolution\r\nwas going further, that it aimed at a great social leveling, that it\r\nwas a movement of the masses in behalf of the lowest classes in the\r\ncommunity, then even British criticism assailed it. At the close of\r\n1790 Edmund Burke published his _Reflections on the Revolution in\r\nFrance_, a bitter arraignment of the newer tendencies and a\r\nrhetorical panegyric of conservatism. Although Burke's sensational work\r\nwas speedily and logically answered by several forceful thinkers,\r\nincluding the brilliant Thomas Paine, nevertheless it long held its\r\nplace as the classical expression of official Britain's horror of\r\nsocial equality and of \"mob violence.\" The book was likewise received\r\nwith such approval by the monarchs of continental Europe, who\r\ninterpreted it as a telling defense of their position, that Catherine\r\nof Russia personally complimented the author and the puppet king of\r\nPoland sent him a flamboyant glorification and a gold medal.\r\nThenceforth the monarchs, as well as the nobles and clergy, of Europe\r\nsaw in the French Revolution only a menace to their political and\r\nsocial privileges: were it communicated to the lower classes, the\r\nRevolution might work the same havoc throughout the length and breadth\r\nof Europe that it was working in France. The \"benevolent despots\" had\r\nsincere desires to labor for the welfare of the people; they shuddered\r\nat the thought of what the people themselves would do in laboring for\r\ntheir own welfare.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Holy Roman Emperor the Champion of Opposition to the\r\nRevolution]\r\n\r\nOf the monarchs of Europe, several had special reasons for viewing the\r\nprogress of the Revolution with misgiving. The Bourbons of Spain and of\r\nthe Two Sicilies were united by blood and family compacts with the\r\nruling dynasty of France: any belittling of the latter's power was\r\nbound to affect disastrously the domestic position and foreign policy\r\nof the former. Then, too, the French queen, Marie Antoinette, was an\r\nAustrian Habsburg. Her family interests were in measure at stake. In\r\nthe Austrian dominions, the visionary and unpractical Joseph II had\r\ndied in 1790 and had been succeeded by another brother of Marie\r\nAntoinette, the gifted though unemotional Emperor Leopold II. Leopold\r\nskillfully extricated himself from the embarrassments at home and\r\nabroad bequeathed him by his predecessor and then turned his attention\r\nto French affairs. He was in receipt of constant and now frantic\r\nappeals from his sister to aid Louis XVI against the revolutionaries.\r\nHe knew that the Austrian Netherlands, whose rebellion he had\r\nsuppressed with difficulty, were saturated with the doctrines of the\r\nRevolution and that many of their inhabitants would welcome annexation\r\nto France. As chief of the Holy Roman Empire, he must keep\r\nrevolutionary agitation out of the Germanies and protect the border\r\nprovinces against French aggression. All these factors served to make\r\nthe Emperor Leopold the foremost champion of the \"old regime\" in Europe\r\nand incidentally of the royal cause in France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Declaration of Pilinitz, August, 1791]\r\n\r\nNow it so happened that the emperor found a curious ally in Prussia.\r\nThe death of Frederick the Great in 1786 had called to the throne of\r\nthat country a distinctly inferior sort of potentate, Frederick William\r\nII (1786-1797), who combined with a nature at once sensual and\r\npleasure-loving a remarkable religious zeal. He neglected the splendid\r\nmilitary machine which Frederick William I and Frederick the Great had\r\nconstructed with infinite patience and thoroughness. He lavished great\r\nwealth upon art as well as upon favorites and mistresses. He tired the\r\nnation with an excessive Protestant orthodoxy. And in foreign affairs\r\nhe reversed the far-sighted policy of his predecessor by allying\r\nhimself with Austria and reducing Prussia to a secondary place among\r\nthe German states. In August, 1791, Frederick William II joined with\r\nthe Emperor Leopold in issuing the public Declaration of Pilinitz, to\r\nthe effect that the two rulers considered the restoration of order and\r\nof monarchy in France an object of \"common interest to all sovereigns\r\nof Europe.\" The declaration was hardly more than pompous bluster, for\r\nthe armies of the German allies were not as yet ready for war, but its\r\nsolemn expression of an intention on the part of foreign despots to\r\ninterfere in the internal affairs of France aroused the most bitter\r\nfeeling among Frenchmen who were patriotic as well as revolutionary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French Politics Under the Limited Monarchy Favorable to\r\nForeign War]\r\n\r\nThe prospect of war with the blustering monarchs of Austria and Prussia\r\nwas quite welcome to several important factions in France. Marie\r\nAntoinette and her court clique gradually came to the conclusion that\r\ntheir reactionary cause would be abetted by war. If the allies won,\r\nabsolutism would be restored in France by force of arms. If the French\r\nwon, it would redound to the prestige of the royal family and enable\r\nthem by constitutional means to recover their authority. Then, too, the\r\nconstitutionalists, the bourgeois party which was led by Lafayette and\r\nwhich loyally supported the settlement of 1791, worked for war.\r\nMilitary success would consolidate the French people and confirm the\r\nconstitution, and Lafayette aspired to win personal glory as the\r\nomnipotent commander. Finally, the overwhelming majority of radicals\r\ncried for war: to them it seemed as if the liberal monarchy would be\r\ncompletely discomfited by it and that out of it would emerge a republic\r\nin France and the general triumph of democratic principles in Europe.\r\nWhy not stir up all the European peoples against their monarchs? The\r\ncause of France should be the cause of Europe. France should be the\r\nmissionary of the new dispensation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political Parties in the Legislative Assembly]\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Assembly, on which depended in last instance the\r\nsolution of all these vital problems, domestic and foreign, represented\r\nseveral diverse shades of political opinion. Of the seven hundred\r\nmembers, four hundred admitted no special leadership but voted\r\nindependently on every question according to individual preference or\r\nfear, while the others were divided between the camp of\r\n_Feuillants_ and that of _Jacobins_. The Feuillants were the\r\nconstitutionalists, inclined, while in general consistently championing\r\nthe settlement of 1791, to strengthen the royal power,--they were the\r\nconservatives of the Assembly. The Jacobins, on the other hand,\r\nderiving their common name from the famous club in Paris, were the\r\nradicals: many of them secretly cherished republican sentiments, and\r\nall of them desired a further diminution of the constitutional powers\r\nof Louis XVI. The Jacobins, however, were divided into two groups on\r\nthe question of how the royal power should be reduced. The larger\r\nnumber, whose most conspicuous members came from the department of the\r\nGironde and were, therefore, collectively designated as Girondists,\r\nentertained the idea that the existing government should be clearly\r\nproved futile before proceeding to the next stage in the Revolution:\r\nthey clamored for foreign war as the most effective means of disgracing\r\nthe existing monarchy. The smaller number of Jacobins, drawn largely\r\nfrom Paris, desired to take no chances on the outcome of war but\r\nadvocated the radical reformation of monarchical institutions by direct\r\nand immediate popular action: subsequently this small group was dubbed\r\nthe Mountain [Footnote: This name did not come into general use until\r\n1793.] from the high seats its members later occupied in the\r\nConvention: they represented the general views of such men as Marat,\r\nDanton, and Robespierre.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Girondists]\r\n\r\nOf the various parties or groups in the Legislative Assembly, the best\r\norganized was the Girondist. Its members, recruited chiefly from the\r\nprovinces, were young, enthusiastic, and filled with noble, if somewhat\r\nunpractical, ideas borrowed from the ancient republics of Greece and\r\nRome. They were cultured, eloquent, and patriotic. In Brissot (1754-\r\n1793), a Parisian lawyer, they had an admirable leader and organizer.\r\nIn Vergniaud (1753-1793), they had a polished and convincing orator. In\r\nCondorcet (1743-1794), they had a brilliant scholar and philosopher. In\r\nDumouriez (1739-1823), they possessed a military genius of the first\r\norder. And in the refined home of the brilliant Madame Roland (1754-\r\n1793), they had a charming center for political discussion.\r\n\r\nIn internal affairs the Legislative Assembly accomplished next to\r\nnothing. Everything was subordinated to the question of foreign war. In\r\nthat, Feuillants and Girondists found themselves in strange agreement.\r\nOnly Marat and Robespierre raised their voices against a policy whose\r\npursuit they dreaded would raise a military dictator. Marat expressed\r\nhis alarms in the _Friend of the People:_ \"What afflicts the\r\nfriends of liberty is that we have more to fear from success than from\r\ndefeat .. .the danger is lest one of our generals be crowned with\r\nvictory and lest ... he lead his victorious army against the capital to\r\nsecure the triumph of the Despot.\" But the counsels of extreme radicals\r\nwere unavailing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Declaration of War against Austria and Prussia, April, 1792]\r\n\r\nIn the excitement the Girondists obtained control of the government and\r\ndemanded of the emperor that the Austrian troops be withdrawn from the\r\nfrontier and that the émigrés be expelled from his territories. As no\r\naction was taken by the emperor, the Girondist ministers prevailed upon\r\nLouis XVI to declare war on 20 April, 1792. Lafayette assumed supreme\r\ncommand, and the French prepared for the struggle. Although Leopold had\r\njust died, his policy was followed by his son and successor, the\r\nEmperor Francis II. Francis and Frederick William II of Prussia\r\nspeedily collected an army of 80,000 men at Coblenz with which to\r\ninvade France. The campaign of 1792 was the first stage in a vast\r\nconflict which was destined to rage throughout Europe for twenty-three\r\nyears. It was the beginning of the contest between the forces of\r\nrevolution and those of reaction.\r\n\r\nEnthusiasm was with the French. They felt they were fighting for a\r\ncause--the cause of liberty, equality, and nationalism. Men put on red\r\nliberty caps, and such as possessed no firearms equipped themselves\r\nwith pikes and hastened to the front. Troops coming up from Marseilles\r\nsang in Paris a new hymn of freedom which Rouget de Lisle had just\r\ncomposed at Strassburg for the French soldiers,--the inspiring\r\nMarseillaise that was to become the national anthem of France. But\r\nenthusiasm was about the only asset that the French possessed. Their\r\narmies were ill-organized and ill-disciplined. Provisions were scarce,\r\narms were inferior, and fortified places in poor repair. Lafayette had\r\ngreater ambition than ability.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early French Reverses]\r\n[Sidenote: Equivocal Position of the Royal Family]\r\n\r\nThe war opened, therefore, with a series of French reverses. An\r\nattempted invasion of the Austrian Netherlands ended in dismal failure.\r\nOn the eastern frontier the allied armies under the duke of Brunswick\r\nexperienced little difficulty in opening up a line of march to Paris.\r\nIntense grew the excitement in the French capital. The reverses gave\r\ncolor to the suspicion that the royal family were betraying military\r\nplans to the enemy. A big demonstration took place on 20 June: a crowd\r\nof market women, artisans, coal heavers, and hod carriers pushed\r\nthrough the royal residence, jostling and threatening the king and\r\nqueen: no violence was done but the temper of the Parisian proletariat\r\nwas quite evident. But Louis and Marie Antoinette simply would not\r\nlearn their lesson. Despite repeated and solemn assurances to the\r\ncontrary, they were really in constant secret communication with the\r\ninvading forces. The king was beseeching aid from foreign rulers in\r\norder to crush his own people; the queen was supplying the generals of\r\nthe allies with the French plans of campaign. Limited monarchy failed\r\nin the stress of war.\r\n\r\n\r\nESTABLISHMENT OF THE FIRST FRENCH REPUBLIC: THE NATIONAL CONVENTION,\r\n1792-1795\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Proclamation of the Duke of Brunswick, 25 July, 1792]\r\n[Sidenote: The French Reply: the Insurrection of 9-10 August, 1792]\r\n\r\nOn 25 July, 1792, the duke of Brunswick (1735-1806), the pig-headed\r\ncommander-in-chief of the allied armies, issued a proclamation to the\r\nFrench people. He declared it his purpose \"to put an end to the anarchy\r\nin the interior of France, to check the attacks upon the throne and the\r\naltar, to reëstablish the legal power, to restore to the king the\r\nsecurity and liberty of which he is now deprived and to place him in a\r\nposition to exercise once more the legitimate authority which belongs\r\nto him.\" The bold duke went on to declare that French soldiers who\r\nmight be captured \"shall be treated as enemies and punished as rebels\r\nto their king and as disturbers of the public peace,\" and that, if the\r\nslightest harm befell any member of the royal family, his Austrian and\r\nPrussian troops would \"inflict an ever-memorable vengeance by\r\ndelivering over the city of Paris to military execution and complete\r\ndestruction, and the rebels guilty of such outrages to the punishment\r\nthat they merit.\" This foolish and insolent manifesto sealed the fate\r\nof the French monarchy. It was the clearest proof that French royalty\r\nand foreign armies were in formal alliance not only to prevent the\r\nfurther development of the Revolution but also to undo what had already\r\nbeen done. And all patriotically minded Frenchmen, whether hitherto\r\nthey had sympathized with the course of events or not, now grew furious\r\nat the threats of foreigners to interfere in the internal affairs of\r\ntheir country. The French reply to the duke of Brunswick was the\r\ninsurrection of 9-10 August, 1792.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Suspension of the King and Fall of Limited Monarchy]\r\n\r\nOn those days the proletariat of Paris revolted against the liberal\r\nmonarchy. They supplanted the bourgeois commune with a radically\r\nrevolutionary commune, in which Danton became the leading figure. They\r\ninvaded the royal palace, massacred the Swiss Guards, and obliged the\r\nking and his family to flee for their lives to the Assembly. On 10\r\nAugust, a remnant of terror-stricken deputies voted to suspend the king\r\nfrom his office and to authorize the immediate election by universal\r\nmanhood suffrage of a National Convention that would prepare a new\r\nconstitution for France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anarchy in France]\r\n\r\nFrom the suspension of the king on 10 August to the assembling of the\r\nNational Convention on 21 September, France was practically anarchical.\r\nThe royal family was incarcerated in the gloomy prison of the Temple.\r\nThe regular governmental agents were paralyzed. Lafayette protested\r\nagainst the insurrection at Paris and surrendered himself to the\r\nallies.\r\n\r\nStill the allies advanced into France. Fear deepened into panic.\r\nSupreme control fell into the hands of the revolutionary commune:\r\nDanton became virtual dictator. His policy was simple. The one path of\r\nsafety left open to the radicals was to strike terror into the hearts\r\nof their domestic and foreign foes. \"In my opinion,\" said Danton, \"the\r\nway to stop the enemy is to terrify the royalists. Audacity, more\r\naudacity, and always greater audacity!\" The news of the investment of\r\nVerdun by the allies, published at Paris on 2 September, was the signal\r\nfor the beginning of a wholesale massacre of royalists in the French\r\ncapital. For five long days unfortunate royalists were taken from the\r\nprisons and handed over by a self-constituted judicial body to the\r\ntender mercies of a band of hired cutthroats. Slight discrimination was\r\nmade of rank, sex, or age. Men, women, and children, nobles and\r\nmagistrates, priests and bishops,--all who were suspected of royalist\r\nsympathy were butchered. The number of victims of these September\r\nmassacres has been variously estimated from 2000 to 10,000.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Danton was infusing new life and new spirit into the French\r\narmies. Dumouriez replaced Lafayette in supreme command. And on 20\r\nSeptember the allies received their first check at Valmy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Valmy: the First Military Success of the Revolutionaries]\r\n[Sidenote: Proclamation of the First French Republic]\r\n\r\nThe very day on which news reached Paris that it was saved and that\r\nBrunswick was in retreat, the National Convention met. Amid the wildest\r\nenthusiasm, it unanimously decreed \"that royalty is abolished in\r\nFrance.\" Then it was resolved to date from 22 September, 1792, Year 1\r\nof the Republic. A decree of perpetual banishment was enacted against\r\nthe émigrés and it was soon determined to bring the king to trial\r\nbefore the Convention.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The National Convention 1792-1795]\r\n\r\nThe National Convention remained in session for three years (1792-\r\n1795), and its work constituted the second great phase of the\r\nRevolution. This work was essentially twofold: (1) It secured a series\r\nof great victories in the foreign war, thereby rendering permanent the\r\nremarkable social reforms of the first period of the Revolution, that\r\nbetween 1789 and 1791; and (2) it constructed a republican form of\r\ngovernment, based on the principle of democracy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Problems Confronting the National Convention]\r\n\r\nPerhaps no legislative body in history has been called upon to solve\r\nsuch knotty problems as those which confronted the National Convention\r\nat the opening of its sessions. At that time it was necessary (1) to\r\ndecide what should be done with the deposed and imprisoned king; (2) to\r\norganize the national defense and turn back foreign invasion; (3) to\r\nsuppress insurrection within France; (4) to provide a strong government\r\nfor the country; (5) to complete and consolidate the social reforms of\r\nthe earlier stage of the Revolution; and (6) to frame a new\r\nconstitution and to establish permanent republican institutions. With\r\nall these questions the Convention coped with infinite industry and\r\nmuch success. And in the few following pages, we shall review them in\r\nthe order indicated, although it should be borne in mind that most of\r\nthem were considered by the Convention simultaneously.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Personnel of the National Convention]\r\n[Sidenote: The Girondists]\r\n[Sidenote: The Mountainists]\r\n[Sidenote: The Plain]\r\n\r\nBefore taking up the work of the Convention, a word should be said\r\nabout the personnel of that body. The elections had been in theory by\r\nalmost universal suffrage, but in practice indifference or intimidation\r\nreduced the actual voters to about a tenth of the total electorate. The\r\nresult was the return of an overwhelming majority of radicals, who,\r\nwhile agreeing on the fundamental republican doctrines, nevertheless\r\ndiffered about details. On the right of the Convention sat nearly two\r\nhundred Girondists, including Brissot, Vergniaud, Condorcet, and the\r\ninteresting Thomas Paine. These men represented largely the well-to-do\r\nbourgeoisie who were more radical in thought than in deed, who ardently\r\ndesired a democratic republic, but who at the same time distrusted\r\nParis and the proletariat. In the raised seats on the opposite side of\r\nthe Convention sat nearly one hundred members of the Mountain, now\r\nexclusively designated as Jacobins--extreme radicals in thought, word,\r\nand deed--disciples of Rousseau--counting among their number Danton,\r\nRobespierre, Carnot, and St. Just. Between the two factions of\r\nMountainists and Girondists sat the Plain, as it was called, the real\r\nmajority of the house, which had no policies or convictions of its own,\r\nbut voted usually according to the dictates of expediency. Our tactful,\r\ntrimming Abbé Sieyès belonged to the Plain. At the very outset the\r\nPlain was likely to go with the Girondists, but as time went on and the\r\nParisian populace clamored more and more loudly against any one who\r\nopposed the action of their allies, the Mountainists, it gradually saw\r\nfit to transfer its affections to the Left.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Trial and Execution of King Louis XVI, 1793]\r\n\r\nThe first serious question which faced the Convention was the\r\ndisposition of the king. The discovery of an iron chest containing\r\naccounts of expenditures for bribing members of the National\r\nConstituent Assembly, coupled with the all but confirmed suspicion of\r\nLouis' double dealings with France and with foreign foes,[Footnote:\r\nAfter the execution of the king, actual letters were discovered which\r\nLouis had dispatched to his fellow monarchs, urging their assistance. A\r\ntypical extract is given in Robinson and Beard, _Readings in Modern\r\nEuropean History_, Vol. I, pp. 287-288.] sealed the doom of that\r\nmiserably weak monarch. He was brought to trial before the Convention\r\nin December, 1792, and condemned to death by a vote of 387 to 334. With\r\nthe majority voted the king's own cousin, the duke of Orleans, an\r\nenthusiastic radical who had assumed the name of Citizen Philippe\r\nÉgalité (Equality). On 21 January, 1793, Louis XVI was beheaded near\r\nthe overthrown statue of his voluptuous predecessor Louis XV in the\r\nPlace de la Révolution (now called the Place de la Concorde). The\r\nunruffled dignity with which he met death was the finest act of his\r\nreign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Military Successes]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the tide of Austrian and Prussian invasion had been rolling\r\naway from France. After Valmy, Dumouriez had pursued the retreating\r\nforeigners across the Rhine and had carried the war into the Austrian\r\nNetherlands, where a large party regarded the French as deliverers.\r\nDumouriez entered Brussels without serious resistance, and was speedily\r\nmaster of the whole country. It seemed as though the French would have\r\nan easy task in delivering the peoples of Europe from their old régime.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: France the Champion of the Revolution]\r\n\r\nEmboldened by the ease with which its armies were overrunning the\r\nneighboring states, the National Convention proposed to propagate\r\nliberty and reform throughout Europe and in December, 1792, issued the\r\nfollowing significant decree: \"The French nation declares that it will\r\ntreat as enemies every people who, refusing liberty and equality or\r\nrenouncing them, may wish to maintain, recall, or treat with a prince\r\nand the privileged classes; on the other hand, it engages not to\r\nsubscribe to any treaty and not to lay down its arms until the\r\nsovereignty and independence of the people whose territory the troops\r\nof the republic shall have entered shall be established, and until the\r\npeople shall have adopted the principles of equality and founded a free\r\nand democratic government.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foreign Fears]\r\n\r\nIn thus throwing down the gauntlet to all the monarchs of Europe and in\r\nputting the issue clearly between democracy and the old régime, the\r\nFrench revolutionaries took a dangerous step. Although a large number\r\nof the neighboring peoples undoubtedly sympathized with the aims and\r\nachievements of the Revolution, the rulers and privileged classes in\r\nmore distant countries, such as Russia, Austria, Prussia, and even\r\nSpain and Great Britain, were still deeply intrenched in the patriotism\r\nand unquestioning loyalty of their people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"First Coalition\" against France]\r\n\r\nThen, too, the execution of Louis XVI in January, 1793, increased the\r\nbitterness of the approaching grave struggle. A royalist reaction in\r\nFrance itself precipitated civil war in La Vendée. Dumouriez, the\r\nablest general of the day, in disgust deserted to the Austrians. And at\r\nthis very time, a formidable coalition of frightened and revengeful\r\nmonarchs was formed to overthrow the French Republic. To Austria and\r\nPrussia, already in the field, were added Great Britain, Holland,\r\nSpain, and Sardinia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Military Endeavours of the Revolutionaries]\r\n\r\nOnce more France was placed on the defensive. Once more the allies\r\noccupied Belgium and the Rhine provinces, and took the roads toward\r\nParis. The situation in the spring of 1793 appeared as critical as that\r\nin the preceding summer. But as the event proved, the republic was a\r\nfar more effective government than the liberal monarchy, Revolutionary\r\nFrance now went gladly to war, singing the Marseillaise and displaying\r\nthe banners of \"Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity.\" Bourgeois citizens,\r\nwhose social and financial gains in the earlier stage of the Revolution\r\nwould be threatened by the triumph of the foreign forces, now gave\r\nmoney and brains to the national defense. Artisans and peasants, who\r\nhad won something and hoped to win more from the success of the\r\nRevolution, now laid down their lives for the cause. Heroism and\r\ndevotion to a great ideal inspired the raw recruits that were rushed to\r\nthe front.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Carnot]\r\n\r\nBut it was not enthusiasm alone that saved France. It was the splendid\r\norganization of that enthusiasm by an efficient central government at\r\nParis. In Carnot (1753-1823) the National Convention possessed a\r\nmilitary and administrative genius of the first order. Of honorable and\r\nupright character, fearless, patriotic, and practical, Carnot plunged\r\ninto the work of organizing the republican armies. His labors were\r\nincessant. He prepared the plans of campaign and the reports that were\r\nsubmitted to the Convention. He raised volunteers and drafted militia,\r\ndrilled them, and hurried them to the frontiers. With the aid of Robert\r\nLindet (1749-1825), the able finance minister, he found means of\r\nfeeding, clothing, and arming the host of soldiers. He personally\r\nvisited the armies and by word and precept infused them with energy and\r\ndetermination. For the first time in modern history a nation was truly\r\nin arms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The New Generals]\r\n\r\nThe work of Carnot was supplemented by the labors of the \"deputies on\r\nmission,\" radical members of the Convention who were detailed to watch\r\nthe generalship and movements of the various French armies, endowed\r\nwith power to send any suspected or unsuccessful commander to the\r\nguillotine and charged with keeping the central government constantly\r\ninformed of military affairs. Gradually, a new group of brilliant young\r\nrepublican generals appeared, among whom the steadfast Moreau (1763-\r\n1813), the stern Pichegru (1761-1804), and the gallant Jourdan (1762-\r\n1833) stood preeminent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French Successes]\r\n[Sidenote: Break-up of the First Coalition, 1795]\r\n\r\nIn this way France met the monster coalition which would have staggered\r\na Louis XIV. The country was cleared of foreign enemies. The war was\r\npressed in the Netherlands, along the Rhine, in Savoy, and across the\r\nPyrenees. So successful were the French that Carnot's popular title of\r\n\"organizer of defense\" was justly magnified to that of \"organizer of\r\nvictory.\" Of course it is impossible in our limited survey to do\r\njustice to these wonderful campaigns of 1794 and 1795. It will suffice\r\nto point out that when the National Convention finally adjourned in\r\n1795, the First Coalition was in reality dissolved. The pitiful Charles\r\nIV of Spain humbled himself to contract a close alliance with the\r\nrepublic which had put his Bourbon cousin to death. By the separate\r\ntreaty of Basel (1795), Prussia gave France a free hand on the left\r\nbank of the Rhine and turned her attention to securing compensation at\r\nthe expense of Poland, William V, the Orange stadholder of Holland, was\r\ndeposed and his country transformed into the Batavian Republic, allied\r\nwith France. French troops were in full possession of the Austrian\r\nNetherlands and all other territories up to the Rhine. The life-long\r\nambition of Louis XIV appeared to have been realized by the new France\r\nin two brief years. Only Great Britain, Austria, and Sardinia remained\r\nin arms against the republic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Suppression of Domestic Insurrection]\r\n\r\nThe foreign successes of the republic seem all the more wonderful when\r\nit is remembered that at the same time serious revolts had to be\r\nsuppressed within France. Opposition to Carnot's drafting of soldiers\r\nwas utilized by reactionary agitators to stir up an insurrection of the\r\npeasants in La Vendée in order to restore the monarchy and to\r\nreëstablish the Roman Catholic Church. Provincial and bourgeois dislike\r\nof the radicalism of the Parisian proletariat caused riots and\r\noutbreaks in such important and widely separated cities as Lyons,\r\nMarseilles, and Bordeaux. With the same devotion and thoroughness that\r\nhad characterized their foreign policy, but with greater sternness, the\r\nofficials of the National Convention stamped out all these riots and\r\ninsurrections. By 1795 all France, except only the émigrés and secret\r\nconspirators, had more or less graciously accepted the republic.\r\n\r\nThe true explanation of these marvelous achievements, whether at home\r\nor abroad, lies in the strong central government which the National\r\nConvention established and in the policy of terrorism which that\r\ngovernment pursued.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rule Of The Committee Of Public Safety]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1793 the National Convention intrusted the supreme\r\nexecutive authority of France to a special committee, composed of nine\r\n(later twelve) of its members, who were styled the Committee of Public\r\nSafety. This small body, which included such Jacobin leaders as Carnot,\r\nRobespierre, and St. Just, acting secretly, directed the ministers of\r\nstate, appointed the local officials, and undertook the administration\r\nof the whole country. Manifold were the duties it was called upon to\r\ndischarge. Among other problems, it must conduct the foreign relations,\r\nsupervise the armies, and secure the active support of the French\r\npeople. Diligently and effectively did it apply itself to its various\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Terror\" A Political Expedient]\r\n\r\nTerrorism has been the word usually employed to describe the internal\r\npolicy of the Committee of Public Safety, and the \"Reign of Terror,\"\r\nthe period of the Committee's chief work, from the summer of 1793 to\r\nthat of 1794. So sensational and so sanguinary was the period that many\r\nwriters have been prone to make it the very center of the Revolution\r\nand to picture \"liberty, equality, and fraternity\" as submerged in a\r\nveritable sea of blood. As a matter of fact, however, the Reign of\r\nTerror was but an incident, though obviously an inevitable incident, in\r\na great Revolution. Nor may the French people be justly accused of a\r\npeculiarly bloodthirsty disposition. Given the same circumstances, it\r\nis doubtful whether similar scenes would not have been enacted at\r\nVienna, Berlin, Madrid, or even London. It must be remembered that\r\ngreat principles and far-reaching reforms were endangered by a host of\r\nforeign and domestic enemies. It seemed to the republican leaders that\r\nthe occasion demanded complete unanimity in France. A divided nation\r\ncould not triumph over united Europe. The only way in which France\r\ncould present a united front to the world was by striking terror into\r\nthe hearts of the opponents of the new régime. And terror involved\r\nbloodshed.\r\n\r\nThe chief allies of the Committee of Public Safety in conducting\r\nterrorism were the Committee of General Security and the Revolutionary\r\nTribunal. The former was given police power in order to maintain order\r\nthroughout the country. The latter was charged with trying and\r\ncondemning any person suspected of disloyalty to the republic. Both\r\nwere responsible to the Committee of Public Safety. A decree of the\r\nConvention, called the Law of Suspects, proclaimed as liable to\r\narbitrary arrest every person who was of noble birth, or had held\r\noffice before the Revolution, or had any relation with an émigré, or\r\ncould not produce a signed certificate of citizenship.\r\n\r\nWith such instruments of despotism France became revolutionary by\r\nstrokes of the guillotine. [Footnote: The guillotine, which is still\r\nused in France, consists of two upright posts between which a heavy\r\nknife rises and falls. The criminal is stretched upon a board and then\r\npushed between the posts. The knife falls and instantly beheads him.\r\nThe device was invented by a certain philanthropic Dr. Guillotine, who\r\nwished to substitute in capital punishment an instrument sure to\r\nproduce instant death in the place of the bungling process of beheading\r\nwith an ax. (Mathews.)] It is estimated that about 2500 persons were\r\nexecuted at Paris during the Reign of Terror. Among others Marie\r\nAntoinette, Philippe Égalité, and Madame Roland suffered death.\r\n\r\nThe Terror spread to the provinces. Local tribunals were everywhere\r\nestablished to search out and condemn suspected persons. The city of\r\nLyons, which ventured to resist the revolutionary government, was\r\npartially demolished and hundreds of its citizens were put to death. At\r\nNantes, where echoes of the Vendée insurrection were long heard, the\r\nbrutal Jacobin deputy Carrier loaded unhappy victims on old hulks which\r\nwere towed out into the Loire and sunk. The total number of those who\r\nperished in the provinces is unknown, but it may have reached ten\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nWhen the total loss of life by means of revolutionary tribunals is\r\ncalculated, it will certainly be found to bear slight comparison with\r\nthe enormous sacrifice of life which any one of the numerous great wars\r\nof the nineteenth century has entailed. The chief wonder about the\r\nReign of Terror is that its champions and supporters, who had so much\r\nat stake, did not do worse things.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Factions among the Revolutionaries]\r\n\r\nA more calamitous phase of the Terror than the slaughter of royalists\r\nand reactionaries was the wretched quarreling among various factions of\r\nthe radicals and the destruction. of one for the benefit of another.\r\nThus, the efforts of the Girondists to stay the execution of the king\r\nand to appeal to the provinces against the violence in Paris, coupled\r\nwith the treason of Dumouriez, seemed to the Parisian proletariat to\r\nmark the alliance of the Girondists with the reactionaries.\r\nAccordingly, the workingmen of Paris, under the leadership of Marat,\r\nrevolted on 31 May, 1793, and two days later obliged the Convention to\r\nexpel twenty-nine Girondist members. Of these, the chief, including\r\nBrissot and Vergniaud, were brought to the guillotine in October, 1793.\r\nNext, the leaders of the commune of Paris, who had gone to such extreme\r\nlengths as to suppress the Christian churches in that city and to\r\nproclaim atheism, were dispatched in March, 1794, by a coalition of the\r\nfollowers of Danton and Robespierre. Then in April, when Danton at\r\nlength wearied of the Terror and counseled moderation, that redoubtable\r\ngenius, together with his friend, Camille Desmoulins, was guillotined.\r\nFinally, Robespierre himself, after enjoying a brief dictatorship,\r\nduring which time he vainly endeavored to put in practice the theories\r\nof Rousseau, was sent, in company with St. Just, to the guillotine by\r\ndirection of the National Convention in July, 1794. This meant the\r\nbeginning of reaction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: End of the Terror: Thermidorian Reaction, 1794]\r\n\r\nThe death of Robespierre ended the Reign of Terror. The purpose of the\r\nTerror, however, was already achieved. The Revolution was preserved in\r\nFrance, and France was preserved in Europe. The Thermidorian Reaction,\r\nas the end of the Terror is called, left the National Convention free\r\nto resume its task of devising a permanent republican constitution for\r\nthe country. A few subsequent attempts were made, now by reactionaries,\r\nnow by extreme radicals, to interfere with the work, but they were\r\nsuppressed with comparative ease. The last uprising of the Parisian\r\npopulace which threatened the Convention was effectually quelled\r\n(October, 1795) by a \"whiff of grape-shot\" discharged at the command of\r\na young and obscure major of artillery, Napoleon Bonaparte by name.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reforms of the National Convention, 1792-1795]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of foreign war and internal dissension, even in the midst\r\nof the Terror, the National Convention found time to further the social\r\nreforms of the earlier stage of the Revolution. Just as the bourgeois\r\nConstituent Assembly destroyed the inequalities arising from the\r\nprivileges of the \"old régime,\" so the popular Convention sought to put\r\nan end to the inequalities arising from wealth. Under its new leaders,\r\nthe Revolution assumed for a time a distinctly socialistic character.\r\nThe property of the émigrés was confiscated for the benefit of the\r\nstate. A maximum price for grain was set by law. Large estates were\r\nbroken up and offered for sale to poorer citizens in lots of two or\r\nthree acres, to be paid for in small annual installments. All ground\r\nrents were abolished without compensation to the owners. \"The rich,\"\r\nsaid Marat, \"have so long sucked out the marrow of the people that they\r\nare now visited with a crushing retribution.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the reforms of the Convention went to absurd lengths. In the\r\npopular passion for equality, every one was to be called \"Citizen\"\r\nrather than \"Monsieur.\" The official record of the expense of Marie\r\nAntoinette's funeral was the simple entry, \"Five francs for a coffin\r\nfor the widow of Citizen Capet.\" Ornate clothing disappeared with\r\ntitles of nobility, and the silk stockings and knee breeches\r\n(_culottes_), which had distinguished the privileged classes and\r\nthe gentlemen, were universally supplanted by the long trousers which\r\nhad hitherto been worn only by the lowest class of workingmen (_sans-\r\nculottes_). To do away with the remembrance of historic\r\nChristianity, the year was divided anew into twelve months, each\r\ncontaining three weeks of ten days (_décades_), every tenth day\r\n(_décadi_) being for rest, and the five or six days left over at\r\nthe end of the year, called _sans-culottides_, were national\r\nholidays; the names of the months were changed, and the revolutionary\r\ncalendar made to date from the establishment of the republic, 22\r\nSeptember, 1792.\r\n\r\nMany of the reforms had long been urgently needed and proved to be of\r\npermanent value. Such was the establishment of a convenient and uniform\r\nsystem of weights and measures, based on decimal reckoning, the so-\r\ncalled metric system, which has come to be accepted by almost all\r\ncivilized nations save the English-speaking peoples. Such, too, was the\r\nelaborate system of state education which the philosopher Condorcet\r\n[Footnote: Marquis de Condorcet (1743-1794).] prepared and which,\r\nthough more pressing questions compelled its postponement, became the\r\nbasis on which the modern scheme of free public instruction has been\r\nbuilt up in France. Such, moreover, was the separation of Church and\r\nstate, effected in September, 1794, the establishment in the following\r\nyear of liberty of worship, and the restoration of the churches to\r\nChristian worship on condition that the clergymen submitted to the laws\r\nof the state. Such, finally, was the project of preparing a single\r\ncomprehensive code of law for the whole country. Although the legal\r\ncode was not completed until the dictatorship of Napoleon Bonaparte,\r\nnevertheless the Convention made a beginning and incorporated in it a\r\nfundamental principle of inheritance that has marked modern France--the\r\nprinciple that no person may will his property to one direct heir to\r\nthe exclusion of others but that all children must inherit almost\r\nequally. Moreover, the practice of imprisoning men for debt was\r\nabolished, negro slavery was ended, and woman's claim on property was\r\nprotected in common with man's. Finally the new republican constitution\r\nwas permeated with ideas of political democracy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Eventual Bourgeois Control Of The National Convention]\r\n\r\nAfter the downfall of Robespierre (Thermidorian Reaction), the National\r\nConvention ceased to press reforms in behalf of the proletariat and\r\ncame more and more under the influence of the moderate well-to-do\r\nbourgeoisie. The law against suspects was repealed and the grain laws\r\nwere amended. The Revolutionary Tribunal was suppressed and the name of\r\nthe Place de la Révolution was changed to the Place de la Concorde. The\r\ndeath in prison of the young and only son of Louis XVI in 1795 was a\r\nsevere blow to the hopes of the royalists. By 1795 France seemed\r\ndefinitively committed to a republican form of government, which,\r\nhowever, would not be extremely radical but only moderate, being now\r\nfounded on the bourgeoisie rather than on the proletariat.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIRECTORY (1795-1799) AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE REPUBLIC INTO A\r\nMILITARY DICTATORSHIP\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Constitution of the Year III, the Constitution of the First\r\nFrench Republic]\r\n[Sidenote: The Directory]\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the first French Republic was drawn up by the\r\nNational Convention during the last year of its session and after it\r\nhad passed under bourgeois influence. This constitution which went into\r\neffect in 1795 and is known, therefore, as the Constitution of the Year\r\nIII (of the Republic), intrusted the legislative power to two chambers,\r\nchosen by indirect election,--a lower house of five hundred members, to\r\npropose laws, and a Council of Ancients, of two hundred and fifty\r\nmembers, to examine and enact the laws. The bourgeois distrust of the\r\nlower classes showed itself again in restricting the electorate to\r\ntaxpayers who had lived at least a year in one place. The executive\r\nauthority of the republic was vested in a board of five members, styled\r\nDirectors, and elected by the legislature, one retiring every year. The\r\nBoard of Directors, or \"Directory,\" was to supervise the enforcement of\r\nlaws and to appoint the ministers of state, or cabinet, who should be\r\nresponsible to it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Brief Duration of the Directory, 1795-1799]\r\n\r\nThus, as the National Constituent Assembly had framed the constitution\r\nfor the liberal monarchy, so the National Convention drafted that for\r\nthe republic. But in strength and durability the republic was hardly\r\nmore fortunate than the limited monarchy. Louis XVI reigned as\r\nconstitutional king under the document of 1791 less than a year. The\r\nDirectory governed in accordance with the constitution of the Year III\r\nless than four years (1795-1799).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Weaknesses in the Directory]\r\n\r\nThe failure of the Directory was due to two chief causes: first, the\r\nprevalence of domestic difficulties; and second, the rise of military\r\npower and the appearance of a victorious, ambitious general. To both of\r\nthese causes reference must be made. The former proved that another\r\nkind of government was needed to cope with the situation; the latter\r\nsuggested what the nature of the new government would be.\r\n\r\nTo consolidate the French people after six years of radical\r\nrevolutionary upheavals required hard and honest labor on the part of\r\nmen of distinct genius. Yet the Directors were, almost without\r\nexception, men of mediocre talents, [Footnote: Carnot, upright and\r\nsincere, and the only member of first-rate ability, was forced out of\r\nthe Directory in 1797.] who practiced bribery and corruption with\r\nunblushing effrontery. They preferred their personal gain to the\r\nwelfare of the state.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political and Social Dissensions]\r\n\r\nThe period of the Directory was a time of plots and intrigues. The\r\nroyalists who were elected in large numbers to the Assemblies were\r\nrestrained from subverting the constitution only by illegal force and\r\nviolence on the part of the Directors. On the other hand, the\r\nextremists in Paris found a warm-hearted leader in a certain Babeuf\r\n(1760-1797), who declared that the Revolution had been directed\r\nprimarily to the advantage of the bourgeoisie, that the proletarians,\r\ndespite their toil and suffering and bloodshed, were still just as\r\npoorly off as ever, and that their only salvation lay in a compulsory\r\nequalization of wealth and the abolition of poverty. An insurrection of\r\nthese radicals--the forerunners of modern Socialism--was suppressed and\r\nBabeuf was put to death in 1797.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Financial Difficulties]\r\n\r\nWhile sincere radicals and convinced reactionaries were uniting in\r\ncommon opposition to the unhappy Directory, the finances of the state\r\nwere again becoming hopelessly involved. \"Graft\" flourished unbridled\r\nin the levying and collecting of the taxes and in all public\r\nexpenditures. To the extravagance of the Directors in internal\r\nadministration were added the financial necessities of armies\r\naggregating a million men. Paris, still in poverty and want, had to be\r\nfed at the expense of the nation. And the issue of _assignats_ by\r\nthe National Constituent Assembly, intended at first only as a\r\ntemporary expedient, had been continued until by the year 1797 the\r\ntotal face value of the _assignats_ amounted to about forty-five\r\nbillion _livres_. So far had the value of paper money depreciated,\r\nhowever, that in March, 1796, three hundred _livres_ in\r\n_assignats_ were required to secure one _livre_ in cash. In\r\n1797 a partial bankruptcy was declared, interest payments being\r\nsuspended on two-thirds of the public debt, and the _assignats_\r\nwere demonetized. The republic faced much the same financial crisis as\r\nhad confronted the absolute monarchy in 1789.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Continued Success in Foreign War]\r\n\r\nFrom but one direction did light stream in upon the Directory--and that\r\nwas the foreign war. When the Directory assumed office, France was\r\nstill at war with Austria, Sardinia, and Great Britain. The general\r\nplan of campaign was to advance one French army across the Rhine,\r\nthrough southern Germany, and thence into the Austrian dominions, and\r\nto dispatch another army across the Alps, through northern Italy, and\r\nthence on to Vienna. Of the army of the Rhine such veteran generals as\r\nPichegru, Jourdan, and Moreau were put in charge. To the command of the\r\narmy operating in Italy, the young and inexperienced Bonaparte was\r\nappointed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Appearance of Napoleon Bonaparte]\r\n\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte hitherto had not been particularly conspicuous in\r\npolitics or in war. He was believed to be in full sympathy with the\r\nRevolution, although he had taken pains after the downfall of\r\nRobespierre to disavow any attachment to the extreme radicals. He had\r\nacquired some popularity by his skillful expulsion of the British from\r\nToulon in 1793, and his protection of the National Convention against\r\nthe uprising of the Parisian radicals in 1795 gave him credit as a\r\nfriend of law and order. Finally, his marriage in 1796 with Josephine\r\nBeauharnais, the widow of a revolutionary general and an intimate\r\nfriend of one of the Directors, bettered his chances of indulging his\r\nfondness for politics and his genius in war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bonaparte's First Italian Campaign, 1796-1797]\r\n[Sidenote: Treaty of Campo Formio, 1797]\r\n\r\nThat very year (1796), while the older and more experienced French\r\ngenerals were repeatedly baffled in their efforts to carry the war into\r\nthe Germanies, the young commander--but twenty-seven years of age--\r\nswept the Austrians from Italy. With lightning rapidity, with\r\ninfectious enthusiasm, with brilliant tactics, with great personal\r\nbravery, he crossed the Alps, humbled the Sardinians, and within a year\r\nhad disposed of five Austrian armies and had occupied every fort in\r\nnorthern Italy. Sardinia was compelled to cede Savoy and Nice to the\r\nFrench Republic, and, when Bonaparte's army approached Vienna, Austria\r\nstooped to make terms with this amazing republican general. By the\r\ntreaty of Campo Formio (1797), France secured the Austrian Netherlands\r\nand the Ionian Islands; Austria obtained, as partial compensation for\r\nher sacrifices, the ancient Venetian Republic, but agreed not to\r\ninterfere in other parts of Italy; and a congress was to assemble at\r\nRastatt to rearrange the map of the Holy Roman Empire with a view to\r\ncompensating those German princes whose lands on the left bank of the\r\nRhine had been appropriated by France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Great Britain Left Alone in Arms Against the French\r\nRepublic]\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1796-1797, known in history as the First Italian\r\ncampaign, was the beginning of a long series of sensational military\r\nexploits which were to rank Napoleon Bonaparte as the foremost soldier\r\nof modern times. Its immediate effect was to complete the dissolution\r\nof the First Coalition by forcing Austria and Sardinia to follow the\r\nexample of Spain, Prussia, and Holland and to make a peace highly\r\nfavorable to the French Republic. Great Britain alone continued the\r\nstruggle against the Directory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bonaparte's Rising Fame]\r\n\r\nAnother effect of the first Italian campaign, almost as immediate and\r\ncertainly more portentous, was the sudden personal fame of Napoleon\r\nBonaparte. He was the most talked-of man in France. The people\r\napplauded him. The government feared but flattered him. Schemers and\r\nplotters of every political faith sought his support. Alongside of\r\ndecreasing respect for the existing government was increasing trust in\r\nBonaparte's strength and ability.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bonaparte's Egyptian Campaign Against Great Britain, 1798]\r\n\r\nIt was undoubtedly with a sense of relief that the despised Directors\r\nin 1798 assented to a project proposed by the popular hero to transport\r\nto Egypt a French expedition with the object of interrupting\r\ncommunications between Great Britain and India. The ensuing Egyptian\r\ncampaign of 1798 was spectacular rather than decisive. Bonaparte made\r\nstirring speeches to his soldiers. He called the Pyramids to witness\r\nthe valor of the French. He harangued the Mohammedans upon the\r\nbeautiful and truthful character of their religion and upon the\r\nadvantages which they would derive from free trade with France. He\r\nencouraged the close study of Egyptian antiquities. [Footnote: It was\r\nan army officer on this Egyptian expedition who discovered the famous\r\nRosetta Stone, by the aid of which hieroglyphics could be deciphered.]\r\nBut his actual victories did not measure up to the excessively colored\r\nreports that he sent home. He was checked in Syria, and a great naval\r\nvictory won by the celebrated English admiral, Lord Nelson, near the\r\nmouth of the Nile, effectually prevented the arrival of reinforcements.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Embarrassments of the Directory during Bonaparte's Absence\r\nfrom France]\r\n\r\nThereupon, General Bonaparte, luckily eluding the British warships,\r\nreturned to France. It was believed by Frenchmen that his last\r\nexpedition had been eminently successful: but that in the meantime the\r\nwork of the Directory had been disastrous, no one doubted. While\r\nBonaparte was away, affairs in France had gone from bad to worse. There\r\nwere new plots, increased financial and social disorders, and finally\r\nthe renewal on a large scale of foreign war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Second Coalition and the Renewal of War in Europe]\r\n\r\nAfter the treaty of Campo Formio, the Directors had prosecuted\r\nzealously the policy of surrounding France with a circle of dependent\r\nrepublics. Even before that peace, Holland had been transformed into\r\nthe Batavian Republic, and now pretexts of various sorts were utilized\r\nto convert the duchy of Milan, or Lombardy, into the Cisalpine\r\nRepublic; the oligarchy of Genoa into the Ligurian Republic; the Papal\r\nStates into the Roman Republic; the kingdom of the Two Sicilies into\r\nthe Parthenopaean Republic; the Swiss Confederation into the Helvetic\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that the governments of all these republics were\r\nmodeled after that of France and were allied with France, the monarchs\r\nof Europe bestirred themselves once more to get rid of the danger that\r\nthreatened them. A Second Coalition was formed by Great Britain,\r\nAustria, and Russia, and, thanks to liberal sums of money supplied by\r\nWilliam Pitt, the British minister, they were able to put large armies\r\nin the field.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French Reverses]\r\n\r\nDuring 1799 the Second Coalition won repeated victories; the French\r\nwere driven from Italy; and most of the dependent republics collapsed.\r\nIt seemed as though Bonaparte's first Italian campaign had been for\r\nnaught. Possibly the military hero of France had himself foreseen this\r\nvery situation and had intended to exploit it to his own advantage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Return of Bonaparte from Egypt: the \"Man of the Hour\"]\r\n\r\nAt any rate, when Bonaparte had sailed for Egypt, he had left his\r\ncountry apparently prosperous, victorious, and honored. Now, when he\r\nlanded at Fréjus on 9 October, 1799, he found France bankrupt,\r\ndefeated, and disgraced. It is small wonder that his journey from\r\nFréjus to Paris was a triumphal procession. The majority of Frenchmen\r\nwere convinced that he was the man of the hour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Coup d'État of the Eighteenth Brumaire: Overthrow of the\r\nDirectory, 1799]  Within a month of his return from Egypt, public\r\nopinion enabled the young conqueror to overthrow the government of the\r\nDirectory. Skillfully intriguing with the Abbé Sieyès, who was now one\r\nof the Directors, he surrounded the Assemblies with a cordon of troops\r\nloyal to himself and on 18-19 Brumaire (9-10 November, 1799) secured by\r\nshow of force the downfall of the government and the appointment of\r\nhimself to supreme military command. This blow at the state (_coup\r\nd'état_) was soon followed by the promulgation of a new\r\nconstitution, by which General Bonaparte became First Consul of the\r\nFrench Republic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Militarism and the Close of the Revolution]\r\n\r\nThe _coup d'état_ of 18 Brumaire virtually ended the Revolution in\r\nFrance. Within the space of ten and a half years from the assembling of\r\nthe Estates-General at Versailles, parliamentary and popular government\r\nfell beneath the sword. The predictions of Marat and Robespierre were\r\nrealized: militarism had supplanted democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION (1789-1799)\r\n\r\nIt may now be possible for us to have some idea as to the real meaning\r\nof these ten years of Assemblies, constitutions, insurrections, and\r\nwars, which have marked the period of the French Revolution. A present-\r\nday visitor in Paris will be struck by the bold letters which stand out\r\non the public buildings and churches: _Liberté, Egalité,\r\nFraternité_--Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. These were the words\r\nwhich the revolutionaries spelled out on their homes, which they\r\nthought embodied the true meaning of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nAs to the meaning of these words, there were certainly quite\r\ncontradictory views. To the royalists and rigid Catholics--to the\r\nprivileged nobility and clergy--to many a surprised peasant--to all the\r\nreactionaries, they meant everything that was hateful, blasphemous,\r\nsordid, inhuman, and unpatriotic. To the enlightened altruistic\r\nbourgeois--to the poverty-stricken workingman of the city--to many a\r\ndreamer and philanthropist--to all the extreme radicals, they were but\r\na shadowy will-of-the-wisp that glimmered briefly and perhaps indicated\r\nfaintly the gorgeousness of the great day that much later might break\r\nupon them. Between these extremes of reaction and radicalism fell the\r\nbulk of the bourgeoisie and of the peasantry--the bulk of the nation--\r\nand it is in their sense that we shall try to make clear the meaning of\r\nthe three symbolical words.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Liberty\"]\r\n\r\n\"Liberty\" implied certain political ideals. Government was henceforth\r\nto be exercised not autocratically by divine right, but\r\nconstitutionally by the sovereign will of the governed. The individual\r\ncitizen was no longer to be subject in all things to a king, but was to\r\nbe guaranteed in possession of personal liberties which no state or\r\nsociety might abridge. Such were liberty of conscience, liberty of\r\nworship, liberty of speech, liberty of publication. The liberty of\r\nowning private property was proclaimed by the French Revolution as an\r\ninherent right of man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Equality\"]\r\n\r\n\"Equality\" embraced the social activities of the Revolution. It meant\r\nthe abolition of privilege, the end of serfdom, the destruction of the\r\nfeudal system. It pronounced all men equal before the law. It aspired,\r\nthough with little success, to afford every man an equal chance with\r\nevery other man in the pursuit of life and happiness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Fraternity\"]\r\n\r\n\"Fraternity\" was the symbol of the brotherhood of those who sought to\r\nmake the world better and happier and more just. In France it found\r\nexpression in an outburst of patriotism and national sentiment. No\r\nlonger did mercenaries fight at the behest of despots for dynastic\r\naggrandizement; henceforth a nation in arms was prepared to do battle\r\nunder the glorious banner of \"fraternity\" in defense of whatever it\r\nbelieved to be for the nation's interests.\r\n\r\nPolitical liberty, social equality, patriotism in the nation,--these\r\nthree have been the enduring watchwords of all those who down to our\r\nown day have looked for inspiration to the French Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL READING\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL.

So\r\ncompletely did this masterful personality dominate the course of events\r\nthat his name has justly been used to characterize this era. The Era of\r\nNapoleon stands out as one of the most significant periods in modern\r\ntimes. Apart from its importance as marking a revolution in the art of\r\nwar, it bore memorable results in two directions: (1) the adaptation of\r\nrevolutionary theories to French practical political necessities, and\r\nthe establishment of many of the permanent institutions of present-day\r\nFrance; and (2) the communication of the revolutionary doctrines of the\r\nFrench Revolution far and wide throughout Europe, so that henceforth\r\nthe movement was general rather than local.\r\n\r\nDuring the first five years of the era (1799-1804) France remained\r\nformally a republic. It was in these years that General Bonaparte, as\r\nFirst Consul, consolidated his country and fashioned the nature of the\r\nlasting gains of the Revolution. Thenceforth, from 1804 to 1814, France\r\nwas an empire, established and maintained by military force. Then it\r\nwas that the national hero--self-crowned Napoleon I, emperor of the\r\nFrench,--by means of war, conquest, annexation, or alliance, spread the\r\nideas of his country far and wide throughout Europe. Before we review\r\nthe main activities of the constructive consulate or of the proselyting\r\nempire, we should have some notion of the character of the leading\r\nactor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH REPUBLIC UNDER THE CONSULATE, 1799-1804\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Napoleon Bonaparte]\r\n\r\nWhen General Bonaparte executed the _coup d'état_ of 1799 and\r\nseized personal power in France, he was thirty years of age, short, of\r\nmedium build, quiet and determined, with cold gray eyes and rather\r\nawkward manners. His early life had been peculiarly interesting. He was\r\nborn at Ajaccio in Corsica on 15 August, 1769, just after the island\r\nhad been purchased by France from Genoa but before the French had fully\r\nsucceeded in quelling a stubborn insurrection of the Corsicans.\r\nBelonging to a prominent and numerous Italian family,--at the outset\r\nhis name was written Napoleone di Buonaparte,--he was selected along\r\nwith sons of other conspicuous Corsican families to be educated at\r\npublic expense in France. In this way he received a good military\r\neducation at Brienne and at Paris. He early displayed a marked fondness\r\nfor the study of mathematics and history as well as for the science of\r\nwar; and, though reserved and taciturn, he was noticeably ambitious and\r\na keen judge of men.\r\n\r\nDuring his youth Buonaparte dreamed of becoming the leader in\r\nestablishing the independence of Corsica, but the outbreak of the\r\nFrench Revolution afforded him a wider field for his enthusiasm and\r\nambition. Already an engineer and artilleryman, he threw in his lot\r\nwith the Jacobins, sympathized at least outwardly with the course of\r\nthe Revolution, and was rewarded, as we have seen, with an important\r\nplace in the recapture of Toulon (1793) and in the defense of the\r\nConvention (1795). It was not, however, until his first Italian\r\ncampaign,--when incidentally he altered his name to the French form,\r\nBonaparte,--that he acquired a commanding reputation as the foremost\r\ngeneral of the French Republic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Bonaparte]\r\n\r\nHow Bonaparte utilized his reputation in order to make himself master\r\nof his adopted country has already been related. It was due in large\r\npart to an extraordinary opportunity which French politics at that time\r\noffered. But it was due, likewise, to certain characteristic qualities\r\nof the young general. In the first place, he was thoroughly convinced\r\nof his own abilities. Ambitious, selfish, and egotistical, he was\r\nalways thinking and planning how he might become world-famous.\r\nFatalistic and even superstitious, he believed that an unseen power was\r\nleading him on to higher and grander honors. He convinced his\r\nassociates that he was \"a man of destiny.\" Then, in the second place,\r\nBonaparte possessed an effective means of satisfying his ambition, for\r\nhe made himself the idol of his soldiers. He would go to sleep\r\nrepeating the names of the corps, and even those of some of the\r\nindividuals who composed them; he kept these names in a corner of his\r\nmemory, and this habit came to his aid when he wanted to recognize a\r\nsoldier and to give him a cheering word from his general. He spoke to\r\nthe subalterns in a tone of good fellowship, which delighted them all,\r\nas he reminded them of their \"common feats of arms.\" Then, in the third\r\nplace, Bonaparte was a keen observer and a clever critic. Being\r\nsagacious, he knew that by 1799 France at large was weary of weak\r\ngovernment and perpetual political strife and that she longed to have\r\nher scars healed by a practical man. Such a man he instinctively felt\r\nhimself to be. In the fourth place, Bonaparte was a politician to the\r\nextreme of being unscrupulous. Knowing what he desired, he was ready\r\nand willing to employ any means to attain his ends. No love for\r\ntheories or principles, no fear of God or man, no sentimental aversion\r\nfrom bloodshed, nothing could deter him from striving to realize his\r\nvaulting but self-centered ambition. Finally, there was in his nature\r\nan almost paradoxical vein of poetry and art which made him human and\r\noften served him well. He dreamed of empires and triumphs. He reveled\r\nin the thought of courts and polished society. He entertained a sincere\r\nadmiration for learning. His highly colored speeches to his soldiers\r\nwere at once brilliant and inspiriting. His fine instinct of the\r\ndramatic gave the right setting to all his public acts. And in the\r\ndifficult arts of lying and deception, Bonaparte has never been\r\nsurpassed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Government Of The Consulate: Constitution Of The Year\r\nVIII]\r\n\r\nSuch was the man who effected the _coup d'état_ of 18 Brumaire\r\n(November, 1799). His first work in his new rôle was to publish a\r\nconstitution, which he prepared in conjunction with the Abbé Sieyès and\r\nwhich was to supersede the Constitution of the Year III. It concealed\r\nthe military despotism under a veil of popular forms. The document\r\nnamed three \"consuls,\" the first of whom was Bonaparte himself, who\r\nwere to appoint a Senate. From lists selected by general election, the\r\nSenate was to designate a Tribunate and a Legislative Body. The First\r\nConsul, in addition to conducting the administration and foreign\r\npolicies and having charge of the army, was to propose, through a\r\nCouncil of State, all the laws. The Tribunate was to discuss the laws\r\nwithout voting on them. The Legislative Body was then to vote on the\r\nlaws without discussing them. And the Senate, acting as a kind of\r\nsupreme court, was to decide all constitutional questions. Thus a\r\nwritten constitution was provided, and the principle of popular\r\nelection was recognized, but in last analysis all the power of the\r\nstate was centered in the First Consul, who was Napoleon Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nThe document was forthwith submitted for ratification to a popular\r\nvote, called a _plebiscite_. So great was the disgust with the\r\nDirectory and so unbounded was the faith of all classes in the military\r\nhero who offered it, that it was accepted by an overwhelming majority\r\nand was henceforth known in French history as the Constitution of the\r\nYear VIII.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foreign Danger Confronting France]\r\n\r\nOne reason why the French nation so readily acquiesced in an obvious\r\nact of usurpation was the grave foreign danger that threatened the\r\ncountry. As we have noted in another connection, the armies of the\r\nSecond Coalition in the course of 1799 had rapidly undone the\r\nsettlement of the treaty of Campo Formio, and, possessing themselves of\r\nItaly and the Rhine valley, were now on the point of carrying the war\r\ninto France. The First Consul perceived at a glance that he must face\r\nessentially the same situation as that which confronted France in 1796.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dissolution of the Second Coalition]\r\n\r\nThe Second Coalition embraced Great Britain, Austria, and Russia.\r\nBonaparte soon succeeded by flattery and diplomacy not only in securing\r\nthe withdrawal of Russia but in actuating the half-insane Tsar Paul to\r\nrevive against Great Britain an Armed Neutrality of the North, which\r\nincluded Russia, Prussia, Sweden, and Denmark. Meanwhile the First\r\nConsul prepared a second Italian campaign against Austria. Suddenly\r\nleading a French army through the rough and icy passes of the Alps, he\r\ndescended into the fertile valley of the Po and at Marengo in June,\r\n1800, inflicted an overwhelming defeat upon the enemy. French success\r\nin Italy was supplemented a few months later by a brilliant victory of\r\nthe army under Moreau at Hohenlinden in southern Germany. Whereupon\r\nAustria again sued for peace, and the resulting treaty of Lunéville\r\n(1801) reaffirmed and strengthened the provisions of the peace of Campo\r\nFormio.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Truce between France and Great Britain: Treaty of Amiens,\r\n1802]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, steps were being taken to terminate the state of war which\r\nhad been existing between France and Great Britain since 1793. Although\r\nFrench arms were victorious in Europe, the British squadron of Lord\r\nNelson (1758-1805) had managed to win and retain the supremacy of the\r\nsea. By gaining the battle of the Nile (1 August, 1798) Nelson had cut\r\noff the supplies of the French expedition in Egypt and eventually\r\n(1801) obliged it to surrender. Now, by a furious bombardment of\r\nCopenhagen (2 April, 1801), Nelson broke up the Armed Neutrality of the\r\nNorth. But despite the naval feats of the British, republican France\r\nseemed to be unconquerable on the Continent. Under these circumstances\r\na treaty was signed at Amiens in March, 1802, whereby Great Britain\r\npromised to restore all the colonial conquests made during the war,\r\nexcept Ceylon and Trinidad, and tacitly accepted the Continental\r\nsettlement as defined at Lunéville. The treaty of Amiens proved to be\r\nbut a temporary truce in the long struggle between France and Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French Reforms under the Consulate]\r\n\r\nSo far, the Consulate had meant the establishment of an advantageous\r\npeace for France. With all foreign foes subdued, with territories\r\nextended to the Rhine, and with allies in Spain, and in the Batavian,\r\nHelvetic, Ligurian, and Cisalpine republics, the First Consul was free\r\nto devote his marvelous organizing and administrative instincts to the\r\ninternal affairs of his country. The period of the Consulate (1799-\r\n1804) was the period of Bonaparte's greatest and most enduring\r\ncontributions to the development of French institutions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Revolutionary Heritage]\r\n\r\nThroughout his career Bonaparte professed himself to be the \"son of the\r\nRevolution,\" the heir to the new doctrine of Liberty, Equality, and\r\nFraternity. It was to the Revolution that he owed his position in\r\nFrance, and it was to France that he claimed to be assuring the results\r\nof the Revolution. Yet, in actual practice, it was equality and\r\nfraternity, but not liberty, that were preserved by the First Consul.\r\n\"What the French people want,\" he declared, \"is equality, not liberty.\"\r\nIn the social order, therefore, Bonaparte rigidly maintained the\r\nabolition of privilege, of serfdom and feudalism, and sought to\r\nguarantee to all Frenchmen equal justice, equal rights, equal\r\nopportunity of advancement. But in the political order he exercised a\r\ntyranny as complete, if less open, than that of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Administrative Centralization]\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the Year VIII (1799) placed in Bonaparte's hands\r\nall the legislative and executive functions of the central government,\r\nand a series of subsequent acts put the law courts under his control.\r\nIn 1800 the local government of the whole country was subordinated to\r\nhim. The extensive powers vested by the Constituent Assembly in\r\nelective bodies of the departments and smaller districts\r\n(_arrondissements_) were now to be wielded by prefects and sub-\r\nprefects, appointed by the First Consul and responsible to him. The\r\nlocal elective councils continued to exist, but sat only for a\r\nfortnight in the year and had to deal merely with the assessment of\r\ntaxes: they might be consulted by the prefect or sub-prefect but had no\r\nserious check upon the executive. The mayor of every small commune was\r\nhenceforth to be chosen by the prefect, while the police of all cities\r\ncontaining more than 100,000 inhabitants were directed by the central\r\ngovernment and the mayors of towns of more than 5000 population were\r\nchosen by Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nThis highly centralized administration of the country afforded the\r\npeople little direct voice in governmental matters but it possessed\r\ndistinct advantages in assuring the prompt, uniform, military-like\r\nexecution of the laws and decrees of the central government. In essence\r\nit was a continuation of the system of intendants instituted by\r\nCardinal Richelieu. How conservative are the French people, at least in\r\nthe institutions of local government, may be inferred from the fact\r\nthat despite many changes in France during the nineteenth century from\r\nrepublic to empire to monarchy to republic to empire to republic,\r\nBonaparte's system of prefects and sub-prefects has survived to the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bonaparte's Centralizing Tendencies]\r\n\r\nAs in administration, so in all his internal reforms, Bonaparte\r\ndisplayed the same fondness for centralization, with consequent\r\nthoroughness and efficiency, at the expense of idealistic liberty. His\r\nreforms of every description--financial, ecclesiastical, judicial,\r\neducational,--and even his public works, showed the guiding hand of the\r\nvictorious general rather than that of the convinced revolutionary.\r\nThey were the adaptation of the revolutionary heritage to the purposes\r\nand policies of one-man power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Financial Readjustment]\r\n[Sidenote: The Bank of France]\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that financial disorders had been the immediate\r\ncause of the downfall of the absolute monarchy as well as of the\r\nDirectory. From the outset, Bonaparte guarded against any such\r\nrecurrence. By careful collection of taxes he increased the revenue of\r\nthe state. By rigid economy, by the severe punishment of corrupt\r\nofficials, and by the practice of obliging people whose lands he\r\ninvaded to support his armies, he reduced the public expenditures. The\r\ncrowning achievement of his financial readjustments was the\r\nestablishment (1800) of the Bank of France, which has been ever since\r\none of the soundest financial institutions in the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ecclesiastical Settlement: the Concordat, 1801]\r\n\r\nAnother grave problem which Bonaparte inherited from the Revolution was\r\nthe quarrel between the state and the Roman Catholic Church. He was\r\ndetermined to gain the political support of the large number of\r\nconscientious French Catholics who had been alienated by the harsh\r\nanti-clerical measures of the revolutionaries. After delicate and\r\nprotracted negotiations, a settlement was reached in a concordat (1801)\r\nbetween Pope Pius VII and the French Republic, whereby the pope, for\r\nhis part, concurred in the confiscation of the property of the Church\r\nand the suppression of the monasteries, and the First Consul undertook\r\nto have the salaries of the clergy paid by the state; the latter was to\r\nnominate the bishops and the former was to invest them with their\r\noffice; the priests were to be appointed by the bishops. In this way\r\nthe Catholic Church in France became a branch of the lay government\r\nmuch more completely than it had been in the time of Louis XIV. So\r\nadvantageous did the arrangement appear that the Concordat of 1801\r\ncontinued to regulate the relations of church and state until 1905.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Judicial Reforms]\r\n[Sidenote: The Code Napoléon]\r\n\r\nOne of the fondest hopes cherished by enlightened liberals was to clear\r\naway the confusion and discrepancies of the numerous legal systems of\r\nthe old régime and to reduce the laws of the land to a simple and\r\nuniform code, so that every person judicial who could read would be\r\nable to know what was legal and what was illegal. The constitution of\r\n1791 had promised such a work; the National Convention had actually\r\nbegun it; but the preoccupations of the leading revolutionaries,\r\ncombined with the natural caution and slowness of the lawyers to whom\r\nthe task was intrusted, delayed its completion. It was not until the\r\ncommanding personality of Bonaparte came into contact with it that real\r\nprogress was made. Then surrounding himself with excellent legal\r\nadvisers [Footnote: Chief among these legal experts was Cambacérès\r\n(1753-1824), the Second Consul.] whom he literally drove to labor, the\r\nFirst Consul brought out a great Civil Code (1804), which was followed\r\nby a Code of Civil Procedure, a Code of Criminal Procedure, a Penal\r\nCode, and a Commercial Code. These codes were of the utmost importance.\r\nThe simplicity and elegance of their form commended them not only to\r\nFrance, but to the greater part of continental Europe. Moreover, they\r\npreserved the most valuable social conquests of the Revolution, such as\r\ncivil equality, religious toleration, equality of inheritance,\r\nemancipation of serfs, freedom of land, legal arrest, and trial by\r\njury. It is true that many harsh punishments were retained and that the\r\nposition of woman was made distinctly inferior to that of man, but, on\r\nthe whole, the French Codes long remained not only the most convenient\r\nbut the most enlightened set of laws in the world. Bonaparte was\r\nrightly hailed as a second Justinian.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The New Educational System]\r\n\r\nA similar motive and the same enthusiasm actuated the First Consul in\r\npressing forward important educational reforms. On the foundation laid\r\nseveral years earlier by Condorcet was now reared an imposing system of\r\npublic instruction. (1) Primary or elementary schools were to be\r\nmaintained by every commune under the general supervision of the\r\nprefects or sub-prefects. (2) Secondary or grammar schools were to\r\nprovide special training in French, Latin, and elementary science, and,\r\nwhether supported by public or private enterprise, were to be subject\r\nto governmental control. (3) _Lycées_ or high schools were to be\r\nopened in every important town and instruction given in the higher\r\nbranches of learning by teachers appointed by the state. (4) Special\r\nschools, such as technical schools, civil service schools, and military\r\nschools, were brought under public regulation. (5) The University of\r\nFrance was established to maintain uniformity throughout the new\r\neducational system. Its chief officials were appointed by the First\r\nConsul, and no one might open a new school or teach in public unless he\r\nwas licensed by the university. (6) The recruiting station for the\r\nteaching staff of the public schools was provided in a normal school\r\norganized in Paris. All these schools were directed to take as the\r\nbases of their teaching the principles of the Catholic Church, loyalty\r\nto the head of the state, and obedience to the statutes of the\r\nuniversity. Despite continued efforts of Bonaparte, the new system was\r\nhandicapped by lack of funds and of experienced lay teachers, so that\r\nat the close of the Napoleonic Era, more than half of the total number\r\nof French children still attended private schools, mostly those\r\nconducted by the Catholic Church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Public Works]\r\n\r\nBonaparte proved himself a zealous benefactor of public works and\r\nimprovements. With very moderate expenditure of French funds, for\r\nprisoners of war were obliged to do most of the work, he enormously\r\nimproved the means of communication and trade within the country, and\r\npromoted the economic welfare of large classes of the inhabitants. The\r\nsplendid highways which modern France possesses are in large part due\r\nto Bonaparte. In 1811 he could enumerate 229 broad military roads which\r\nhe had constructed, the most important of which, thirty in number,\r\nradiated from Paris to the extremities of the French territory. Two\r\nwonderful Alpine roads brought Paris in touch with Turin, Milan, Rome,\r\nand Naples. Numerous substantial bridges were built. The former network\r\nof canals and waterways was perfected. Marshes were drained, dikes\r\nstrengthened, and sand dunes hindered from spreading along the ocean\r\ncoast. The principal seaports, both naval and commercial, were enlarged\r\nand fortified, especially the harbors of Cherbourg and Toulon.\r\n\r\nAlong with such obviously useful labor went desirable embellishment of\r\nlife. State palaces were restored and enlarged, so that, under\r\nBonaparte, St. Cloud, Fontainebleau, and Rambouillet came to rank with\r\nthe majesty of Versailles. The city of Paris was beautified. Broad\r\navenues were projected. The Louvre was completed and adorned with\r\nprecious works of art which Bonaparte dragged as fruits of victory from\r\nItaly, or Spain, or the Netherlands. During the Consulate, Paris was\r\njust beginning to lay claim to a position as the pleasure city of\r\nEurope. Its population almost doubled during the Era of Napoleon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Colonial Enterprises and their Failure]\r\n\r\nThe First Consul also entertained the hope of appearing as the restorer\r\nof the French colonial empire. In 1800 he prevailed upon the Spanish\r\ngovernment to re-cede to France the extensive territory--called\r\nLouisiana--lying west of the Mississippi River. Soon afterwards he\r\ndispatched his brother-in-law, General Leclerc, with an army of 25,000\r\nmen, to make good the French claims to the large island of Haiti. But\r\nthe colonial ventures of Napoleon ended in failure. In Haiti, Leclerc's\r\nefforts to reestablish negro slavery encountered the stubborn\r\nresistance of the blacks, organized and led by one of their number,\r\nToussaint L'Ouverture, a remarkable military genius. After a determined\r\nand often ferocious struggle Leclerc proposed a compromise, and\r\nToussaint, induced by the most solemn guarantees on the part of the\r\nFrench, laid down his arms. He was seized and sent to France, where he\r\ndied in prison in 1803. The negroes, infuriated by this act of\r\ntreachery, renewed the war with a barbarity unequaled in previous\r\ncontests. The French, further embarrassed by the appearance of a\r\nBritish fleet, were only too glad to relinquish the island in November,\r\n1803. Meanwhile, expectation of war with Great Britain had induced\r\nBonaparte in April, 1803, to sell the entire Louisiana Territory to the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Success of the Consulate]\r\n\r\nIf we except these brief and ill-starred colonial exploits, we may\r\npronounce the First Consul's government and achievements eminently\r\nsuccessful. Bonaparte had inspired public confidence by the honesty of\r\nhis administration and by his choice of officials, for he was served by\r\nsuch a consummate diplomat as Talleyrand and by such a tireless chief\r\nof police as Fouché. His speedy and victorious termination of the War\r\nof the Second Coalition and his subsequent apparent policy of peace had\r\nredounded to his credit. His sweeping and thorough reforms in internal\r\naffairs had attracted to his support many and varied classes in the\r\ncommunity--the business interests, the bourgeoisie, the peasantry, and\r\nthe sincere Catholics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dwindling Opposition to Bonaparte]\r\n\r\nOnly two groups--and these continually dwindling in size and\r\nimportance--stood in the way of Bonaparte's complete mastery of France.\r\nOne was the remnant of the Jacobins who would not admit that the\r\nRevolution was ended. The other was the royalist party which longed to\r\nundo all the work of the Revolution. Both these factions were reduced\r\nduring the Consulate to secret plots and intrigues. Attempts to\r\nassassinate the First Consul served only to increase his popularity\r\namong the masses. Early in 1804 Bonaparte unearthed a conspiracy of\r\nroyalists, whom he punished with summary vengeance. General Pichegru,\r\nwho was implicated in the conspiracy, was found strangled in prison\r\nsoon after his arrest. Moreau, who was undoubtedly the ablest general\r\nin France next to Bonaparte, was likewise accused of complicity,\r\nalthough he was a stanch Jacobin, and escaped more drastic punishment\r\nonly by becoming an exile in America. Not content with these\r\nadvantages, Bonaparte determined thoroughly to terrorize the royalists:\r\nby military force he seized a young Bourbon prince, the due d'Enghien,\r\non German soil, and without a particle of proof against him put him to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Transformation of the Consulate into the Empire]\r\n\r\nIn 1802 a plébiscite had bestowed the Consulate on Bonaparte for life.\r\nNow there was little more to do than to make the office hereditary and\r\nto change its name. This alteration was proposed in 1804 by the\r\nsubservient Senate and promptly ratified by an overwhelming popular\r\nvote. On 2 December, 1804, amid imposing ceremonies in the ancient\r\ncathedral of Notre Dame, in the presence of Pope Pius VII, who had come\r\nall the way from Rome to grace the event, General Bonaparte placed a\r\ncrown upon his own head and assumed the title of Napoleon I, emperor of\r\nthe French.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH EMPIRE AND ITS TERRITORIAL EXPANSION\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The French Empire a Continuation of the First French\r\nRepublic]\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the empire was by no means a break in French\r\nhistory. The principle of popular sovereignty was still recognized. The\r\nsocial gains of the Revolution were still intact. The magic words\r\n\"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\" still blazed proudly forth on public\r\nbuildings. The tricolor was still the flag of France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lapse of Republican Institutions]\r\n\r\nOf course a few changes were made in externals. The title of \"citoyen\"\r\nwas again replaced by that of \"monsieur.\" The republican calendar\r\ngradually lapsed. Napoleon's relatives became \"grand dignitaries.\" The\r\nrevolutionary generals who accepted the new regime were promoted to be\r\n\"marshals of the empire.\" The old titles of nobility were restored, and\r\nnew ones created.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Monarchical Alteration in Dependent States]\r\n\r\nThe outward changes in France were reflected in the dependent\r\nsurrounding states. And in effecting the foreign alterations, Napoleon\r\ntook care to provide for his numerous family. For his brother Louis,\r\nthe Batavian Republic was transformed into the kingdom of Holland. For\r\nhis brother Jerome, estates were subsequently carved out of Hanover,\r\nPrussia, and other northwest German lands to form the kingdom of\r\nWestphalia. Brother Joseph was seated on the Bourbon throne of the Two\r\nSicilies. The Cisalpine Republic became the kingdom of Italy with\r\nNapoleon as king, and Eugène Beauharnais, his stepson, as viceroy. Both\r\nPiedmont and Genoa were incorporated into the French Empire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Censorship of the Press and Activity of the Secret Police]\r\n[Sidenote: The Eventual Absolutism of Napoleon]\r\n\r\nThe Consulate, as has been explained, was characterized by a policy of\r\npeace. Sweeping reforms had been accomplished in internal affairs so\r\nthat France was consolidated and the vast majority of her citizens\r\nbecame devoted supporters of the emperor. What adverse criticism\r\nFrenchmen might have directed against the empire was stifled by the\r\nactivity of a splendidly organized secret police and by a rigorous\r\ncensorship of the press. So complete was Napoleon's control of the\r\nstate that the decisive naval defeat of Trafalgar was not mentioned by\r\na single French newspaper until after the fall of the empire. By\r\ndegrees the imperial despotism of the Corsican adventurer became as\r\nrigid as the absolute monarchy of the Bourbons. In fact, Napoleon went\r\nso far as to adapt an old catechism which the celebrated Bishop Bossuet\r\nhad prepared during the reign of Louis XIV and to order its use by all\r\nchildren. A few extracts from the catechism will make clear how\r\nNapoleon wished to be regarded.\r\n\r\n\"_Question_. What are the duties of Christians toward those who\r\ngovern them, and what in particular are our duties towards Napoleon I,\r\nour emperor?\r\n\r\n\"_Answer_. Christians owe to the princes who govern them, and we\r\nin particular owe to Napoleon I, our emperor, love, respect, obedience,\r\nfidelity, military service, and the taxes levied for the preservation\r\nand defense of the empire and of his throne. We also owe him fervent\r\nprayers for his safety and for the spiritual and temporal prosperity of\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\n\"_Question_. Why are we subject to all these duties toward our\r\nemperor?\r\n\r\n\"_Answer_. First, because God, who has created empires and\r\ndistributed them according to His will, has, by loading our emperor\r\nwith gifts both in peace and in war, established him as our sovereign\r\nand made him the agent of His power and His image upon earth. To honor\r\nand serve our emperor is, therefore, to honor and serve God Himself.\r\nSecondly, because our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, both by His teaching\r\nand His example, has taught us what we owe to our sovereign. Even at\r\nHis very birth He obeyed the edict of Cæsar Augustus; He paid the\r\nestablished tax and while He commanded us to render to God those things\r\nwhich belong to God, He also commanded us to render unto Cæsar those\r\nthings which are Cæsar's.\r\n\r\n\"_Question_. What must we think of those who are wanting in their\r\nduties towards our emperor?\r\n\r\n\"_Answer_. According to the Apostle Paul, they are resisting the\r\norder established by God Himself, and render themselves worthy of\r\neternal damnation.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Military Ambition of Napoleon]\r\n\r\nWith opposition crushed in France and with the loyalty of the French\r\nnation secured, Napoleon as emperor could gratify his natural instincts\r\nfor foreign aggrandizement and glory. He had become all-powerful in\r\nFrance; he would become all-powerful in Europe. Ambitious and\r\nsuccessful in the arts of peace, he would be more ambitious and more\r\nsuccessful in the science of war. The empire, therefore, meant war\r\nquite as clearly as the Consulate meant peace. To speculate upon what\r\nNapoleon might have accomplished for France had he restrained his\r\nambition and continued to apply his talents entirely to the less\r\nsensational triumphs of peace, is idle, because Napoleon was not that\r\ntype of man. He lived for and by selfish ambition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Empire Military]\r\n\r\nThe ten years of the empire (1804-1814) were attended by continuous\r\nwarfare. Into the intricacies of the campaigns it is neither possible\r\nnor expedient in the compass of this chapter to enter. It is aimed,\r\nrather, to present only such features of the long struggle as are\r\nsignificant in the general history of Europe, for the wars of Napoleon\r\nserved a purpose which their prime mover only incidentally had at\r\nheart--the transmission of the revolutionary heritage to Europe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Renewal of War between France and Great Britain]\r\n\r\nWhen the empire was established, war between France and Great Britain,\r\ninterrupted by the truce of Amiens, had already broken forth afresh.\r\nThe struggle had begun in first instance as a protest of the British\r\nmonarchy against the excesses of the French Revolution, especially\r\nagainst the execution of Louis XVI, and doubtless the bulk of the\r\nEnglish nation still fancied that they were fighting against revolution\r\nas personified in Napoleon Bonaparte. But to the statesmen and\r\ninfluential classes of Great Britain as well as of France, the conflict\r\nhad long assumed a deeper significance. It was an economic and\r\ncommercial war. The British not only were mindful of the assistance\r\nwhich France had given to American rebels, but also were resolved that\r\nFrance should not regain the colonial empire and commercial position\r\nwhich she had lost in the eighteenth century. The British had struggled\r\nto maintain their control of the sea and the monopoly of trade and\r\nindustry which attended it. Now, when Napoleon extended the French\r\ninfluence over the Netherlands and Holland, along the Rhine, and\r\nthroughout Italy, and even succeeded in negotiating an alliance with\r\nSpain, Britain was threatened with the loss of valuable commercial\r\nprivileges in all those regions, and was further alarmed by the\r\nambitious colonial projects of Napoleon. In May, 1803, therefore, Great\r\nBritain declared war. The immediate pretext for the resumption of\r\nhostilities was Napoleon's positive refusal to cease interfering in\r\nItaly, in Switzerland, and in Holland.\r\n\r\nNapoleon welcomed the renewal of war. He understood that until he had\r\ncompletely broken the power of Great Britain all his Continental\r\ndesigns were imperiled and his colonial and commercial projects\r\nhopeless. The humiliation of the great rival across the Channel would\r\nbe the surest guarantee of the prosperity of the French bourgeoisie,\r\nand it was in last analysis from that class that his own political\r\nsupport was chiefly derived. The year 1803-1804 was spent by the\r\nemperor in elaborate preparations for an armed invasion of England.\r\nAlong the Channel coast were gradually collected at enormous cost a\r\nhost of transports and frigates, a considerable army, and an abundance\r\nof supplies. To the amazing French armament, Spain was induced to\r\ncontribute her resources.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Third Coalition Against France]\r\n\r\nGreat Britain replied to these preparations by covering the Channel\r\nwith a superior fleet, by preying upon French commerce, and by seizing\r\nSpanish treasure-ships from America. And William Pitt, the very\r\nembodiment of the Englishman's prejudice against things French,\r\nreturned to the ministry of his country. Pitt was unwilling to risk\r\nBritish armies against the veterans of Napoleon, preferring to spend\r\nliberal sums of money in order to instigate the Continental Powers to\r\ncombat the French emperor. Pitt was the real bone and sinews of the\r\nThird Coalition, which was formed in 1805 by Great Britain, Austria,\r\nRussia, and Sweden to overthrow Napoleon.\r\n\r\nAustria naturally smarted under the provisions of the treaty of\r\nLunéville quite as much as under those of Campo Formio. Francis II was\r\naroused by French predominance in Italy and now that he himself had\r\nadded the title of \"hereditary emperor of Austria\" to his shadowy\r\ndignity as \"Holy Roman Emperor\" he was irritated by the upstart\r\nNapoleon's assumption of an imperial title.\r\n\r\nIn Russia the assassination of the Tsar Paul, the crazy admirer of\r\nBonaparte, had called to the throne in 1801 the active though easily\r\ninfluenced Alexander I. In early life Alexander had acquired a\r\npronounced taste for revolutionary philosophy and its liberal ideas,\r\nand likewise a more or less theoretical love of humanity. Now, Pitt\r\npersuaded him, with the assistance of English gold, that Napoleon was\r\nthe enemy both of true liberty and of humanity. So the tsar joined his\r\narmy with that of Austria, and in the autumn of 1805 the allies\r\nadvanced through southern Germany toward the Rhine.\r\n\r\nPitt had done his best to bring Prussia into the coalition, but the\r\nPrussian king, Frederick William III (1797-1840), was timid and\r\nirresolute, and, despite the protests of his people, was cajoled by\r\nNapoleon's offer of Hanover into a declaration of neutrality. Bavaria\r\nand Württemberg, from fear of Austria, became open allies of the French\r\nemperor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Napoleon vs. Austria]\r\n\r\nBefore the troops of the Third Coalition could threaten the eastern\r\nfrontier of France, Napoleon abandoned his military projects against\r\nGreat Britain, broke up his huge armaments along the Atlantic coast,\r\nand, with his usual rapidity of march, hurled his finely trained army\r\nupon the Austrians near the town of Ulm in Württemberg. There, on 20\r\nOctober, 1805, the Austrian commander, with some 50,000 men,\r\nsurrendered, and the road to Vienna was open to the French.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Trafalgar (1805) and the Continued Sea Power of Great\r\nBritain]\r\n\r\nThis startling military success was followed on the very next day by a\r\nnaval defeat quite as sensational and even more decisive. On 21\r\nOctober, the allied French and Spanish fleets, issuing from the harbor\r\nof Cadiz, encountered the British fleet under Lord Nelson, and in a\r\nterrific battle off Cape Trafalgar were completely worsted. Lord Nelson\r\nlost his life in the conflict, but from that day to the close of the\r\nNapoleonic Era British supremacy on the high seas was not seriously\r\nchallenged.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Austerlitz, 1805]\r\n\r\nWasting no tears or time on the decisive loss of sea-power, Napoleon\r\nhastened to follow up his land advantages. Occupying Vienna, he turned\r\nnorthward into Moravia where 1805 Francis II and Alexander I had\r\ngathered a large army of Austrians and Russians. On 2 December, 1805,\r\nthe anniversary of his coronation as emperor,--his \"lucky\" day, as he\r\ntermed it,--Napoleon overwhelmed the allies at Austerlitz in one of the\r\ngreatest battles in history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defeat of Austria: Treaty of Pressburg, 1805]\r\n\r\nThe immediate result of the campaign of Ulm and Austerlitz was the\r\nenforced withdrawal of Austria from the Third Coalition. Late in\r\nDecember, 1805, the emperors Francis II and Napoleon signed the treaty\r\nof Pressburg, whereby the former ceded Venetia to the kingdom of Italy\r\nand recognized Napoleon as its king, and resigned the Tyrol to Bavaria,\r\nand outlying provinces in western Germany to Württemberg. Both Bavaria\r\nand Württemberg were converted into kingdoms. By the humiliating treaty\r\nof Pressburg, Austria thus lost 3,000,000 subjects and large revenues;\r\nwas cut off from Italy, Switzerland, and the Rhine; and was reduced to\r\nthe rank of a second-rate power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Napoleon vs. Prussia]\r\n[Sidenote: Jena (1806) and the Humiliation of Prussia]\r\n\r\nFor a time it seemed as if the withdrawal of Austria from the Third\r\nCoalition would be fully compensated for by the adhesion of Prussia.\r\nStung by the refusal of Napoleon to withdraw his troops from southern\r\nGermany and by the bootless haggling over the transference of Hanover,\r\nand goaded on by his patriotic and high-spirited wife, the beautiful\r\nQueen Louise, timid Frederick William III at length ventured in 1806 to\r\ndeclare war against France. Then, with a ridiculously misplaced\r\nconfidence in the old-time reputation of Frederick the Great, without\r\nwaiting for assistance from the Russians who were coming up, the\r\nPrussian army--some 110,000 strong, under the old-fashioned duke of\r\nBrunswick--advanced against the 150,000 veterans of Napoleon. The\r\nresulting battle of Jena, on 14 October, 1806, proved the absolute\r\nsuperiority of Napoleon's strategy and of the enthusiastic French\r\nsoldiers over the older tactics and military organization of the\r\nPrussians. Jena was not merely a defeat for the Prussians; it was at\r\nonce a rout and a total collapse of that Prussian military prestige\r\nwhich in the course of the eighteenth century had been gained by the\r\nutmost sacrifice. Napoleon entered Berlin in triumph and took\r\npossession of the greater part of the kingdom of Prussia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Napoleon vs. Russia, Friedland]\r\n[Sidenote: Treaty of Tilsit (1807): Dissolution of the Third Coalition]\r\n\r\nThe Russians still remained to be dealt with. Winter was a bad season\r\nfor campaigning in East Prussia, and it was not until June, 1807, at\r\nFriedland, that Napoleon was able to administer the same kind of a\r\ndefeat to the Russians that he had administered to the Austrians at\r\nAusterlitz and to the Prussians at Jena. The Tsar Alexander at once\r\nsued for peace. At Tilsit, on a raft moored in the middle of the River\r\nNiemen, Napoleon and Alexander met and arranged the terms of peace for\r\nFrance, Russia, and Prussia. The impressionable tsar was dazzled by the\r\nstriking personality and the unexpected magnanimity of the emperor of\r\nthe French. Hardly an inch of Russian soil was exacted, only a promise\r\nto coöperate in excluding British trade from the Continent. Alexander\r\nwas accorded full permission to deal as he would with Finland and\r\nTurkey. \"What is Europe?\" exclaimed the emotional tsar: \"Where is it,\r\nif it is not you and I?\" But Prussia had to pay the price of the\r\nalliance between French and Russian emperors. From Prussia was torn the\r\nportion of Poland which was erected into the grand-duchy of Warsaw,\r\nunder Napoleon's obsequious ally, the elector of Saxony. Despoiled\r\naltogether of half of her territories, compelled to reduce her army to\r\n42,000 men, and forced to maintain French troops on her remaining lands\r\nuntil a large war indemnity was paid, Prussia was reduced to the rank\r\nof a third-rate power. Tilsit destroyed the Third Coalition and made\r\nNapoleon master of the Continent. Only Great Britain and Sweden\r\nremained under arms, and against the latter country Napoleon was now\r\nable to employ both Denmark and Russia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Humiliation of Sweden]\r\n\r\nEarly in 1808 a Russian army crossed the Finnish border without any\r\nprevious declaration of war, and simultaneously a Danish force prepared\r\nto invade Sweden from the Norwegian frontier. The ill-starred Swedish\r\nking, Gustavus IV (1792-1809), found it was all he could do, even with\r\nBritish assistance, to fight off the Danes. The little Finnish army,\r\nleft altogether unsupported, succumbed after an heroic struggle against\r\noverwhelming odds, and in 1809 the whole of Finland and the Åland\r\nIslands were formally ceded to Russia. Finland, however, did not enter\r\nRussia as a conquered province, but, thanks to the bravery of her\r\npeople and not less to the wisdom and generosity of the Tsar Alexander,\r\nshe long maintained her free constitution and was recognized as a semi-\r\nindependent grand-duchy with the Russian tsar as grand-duke. Thus\r\nSweden lost her ancient duchy of Finland, and she was permitted to\r\nretain a small part of Pomerania only at the humiliating price of\r\nmaking peace with Napoleon and excluding British goods from all her\r\nports, In the same year, Gustavus IV was compelled to abdicate in favor\r\nof his uncle, Charles XIII (1809-1818), an infirm and childless old\r\nman, who was prevailed upon to designate as his successor one of\r\nNapoleon's own marshals, General Bernadotte. Surely, Napoleon might\r\nhope henceforth to dominate Sweden as he then dominated every other\r\nContinental state. Of course, Great Britain, triumphant on the seas,\r\nremained unconquered, but the British army, the laughingstock of\r\nEurope, could expect to achieve little where Austria, Prussia, Russia,\r\nand Sweden had failed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Height of Napoleon's Power, 1808]\r\n\r\nThe year that followed Tilsit may be taken as marking the height of\r\nNapoleon's career. The Corsican adventurer was emperor of a France that\r\nextended from the Po to the North Sea, from the Pyrenees and the Papal\r\nStates to the Rhine, a France united, patriotic, and in enjoyment of\r\nmany of the fruits of the Revolution. He was king of an Italy that\r\nembraced the fertile valley of the Po and the ancient possessions of\r\nVenice, and that was administered by a viceroy, his stepson and heir-\r\napparent, Eugène Beauharnais. The pope was his friend and ally. His\r\nbrother Joseph governed the kingdom of Naples. His brother Louis and\r\nhis stepdaughter Hortense were king and queen of Holland. His sister\r\nElise was princess of the diminutive state of Lucca. The kings of Spain\r\nand Denmark were his admirers and the tsar of Russia now called him\r\nfriend and brother. A restored Poland was a recruiting station for his\r\narmy. Prussia and Austria had become second- or third-rate powers, and\r\nFrench influence once more predominated in the Germanies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Profound Changes in the Germanies]\r\n\r\nIt was in the Germanies, in fact, that Napoleon's achievements were\r\nparticularly striking. Before his magic touch many of the antique\r\npolitical and social institutions of that country crumbled away. As\r\nearly as 1801 the diminution of the number of German states had begun.\r\nThe treaty of Lunéville had made imperative some action on the part of\r\nthe Diet of the Holy Roman Empire in order to indemnify the rulers\r\nwhose lands on the left bank of the Rhine had been incorporated into\r\nFrance, and to grant \"compensations\" to the south German states. After\r\nlaborious negotiations, lasting from 1801 to 1803, the Diet authorized\r\n[Footnote: By a decree, called the\r\n_Reichsdeputationshauptschluss_.] the wholesale confiscation\r\nthroughout southern Germany of ecclesiastical lands and of free cities,\r\nwith the result that 112 formerly independent states lying east of the\r\nRhine were wiped out of existence and nearly one hundred others on the\r\nwest bank were added to France. Thus the number of the Germanies was\r\nsuddenly reduced from more than three hundred to less than one hundred,\r\nand the German states which mainly benefited, along with Prussia, were\r\nthe southern states of Bavaria, Württemberg, and Baden, which Napoleon\r\ndesired to use as an equipoise against both Austria and Prussia. In\r\nthis ambition he was not disappointed, for in the War of the Third\r\nCoalition (1805) he received important assistance from these three\r\nstates, all of which were in turn liberally rewarded for their\r\nservices, the rulers of Bavaria and Württemberg being proclaimed kings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extinction of the Holy Roman Empire (1806), and its\r\nReplacement by the Empire of Austria and the Confederation of the\r\nRhine]\r\n\r\nThe year 1806 was epochal in German history. On 19 July, the\r\nConfederation of the Rhine was formally established with Napoleon as\r\nProtector. The kings of Bavaria and Württemberg, the grand-dukes of\r\nBaden, Hesse-Darmstadt, and Berg, the archbishop of Mainz, and nine\r\nminor princes virtually seceded from the Holy Roman Empire and accepted\r\nthe protection of Napoleon, whom they pledged themselves to support\r\nwith an army of 63,000 men. On 1 August, Napoleon declared that he no\r\nlonger recognized the Holy Roman Empire, and on 6 August the Habsburg\r\nemperor, Francis II, resigned the crown which his ancestors for\r\ncenturies had worn. The work of a long line of French kings and\r\nstatesmen,--Francis I, Henry IV, Richelieu, Mazarin, Louis XIV,--was\r\nthus consummated by Napoleon Bonaparte. The Holy Roman Empire had at\r\nlast come to the inglorious end which it had long deserved. And its\r\nlast emperor had to content himself with his newly appropriated title\r\nof Francis I, Hereditary Emperor of Austria. The dignity and might of\r\nthe proud Habsburgs had declined before a mere upstart of the people as\r\nnever before a royal Bourbon. And this same year, 1806, witnessed, as\r\nwe have seen, not only the humiliation of Austria but the deepest\r\ndegradation of Prussia.\r\n\r\nBy 1808 all the Germanies were at the mercy of Napoleon. Prussia was\r\nshorn of half her possessions and forced to obey the behests of her\r\nconqueror. The Confederation of the Rhine was enlarged and solidified.\r\nA kingdom of Westphalia was carved out of northern and western Germany\r\nat the expense of Prussia, Hanover, Brunswick, and Hesse, and bestowed\r\nupon Jerome, brother of Napoleon. The grand-duchy of Berg was governed\r\nby the Protector's plebeian brother-in-law, Joachim Murat. And,\r\ngreatest fact of all, wherever the French emperor's rule extended,\r\nthere followed the abolition of feudalism and serfdom, the recognition\r\nof equality of all citizens before the law, the principles and precepts\r\nof the Code Napoléon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Napoleon \"the Son of the Revolution\"]\r\n\r\nThis was the true apogee of Napoleon's power. From the November day in\r\n1799 when the successful general had overthrown the corrupt and\r\ndespicable Directory down to 1808, his story is a magnificent\r\nsuccession of the triumphs of peace and of war. Whatever be the\r\njudgment of his contemporaries or of posterity upon his motives, there\r\ncan be little question that throughout these nine years he appeared to\r\nFrance and to Europe what he proclaimed himself--\"the son of the\r\nRevolution.\" He it was who in the lull between the combats of the\r\nSecond Coalition and those of the Third had consolidated the work of\r\nthe democratic patriots from Mirabeau to Carnot and had assured to\r\nFrance the permanent fruits of the Revolution in the domains of\r\nproperty, law, religion, education, administration, and finance. He it\r\nwas who, if narrowing the concept of liberty, had broadened the\r\nsignificance of equality by the very lesson of his own rise to power\r\nand had deepened the meaning of fraternity by lavishing affection and\r\ndevotion upon that machine of democracy--the national army--the \"nation\r\nin arms.\" And he it was who, true to the revolutionary tradition of\r\nstriking terror into the hearts of the divine-right monarchs of Europe,\r\nhad with a mighty noise shaken the whole Continent and brought down the\r\npolitical and social institutions of the \"old régime\" tumbling in ruins\r\nthroughout central and southern Europe. He had made revolutionary\r\nreform too solid and too widespread to admit of its total extinction by\r\nthe allied despots of Europe. The dream which a Leopold and a Frederick\r\nWilliam had cherished in 1791 of turning back the hands on the clock of\r\nhuman progress and of restoring conditions in France as they had been\r\nprior to 1789, was happily dispelled. But in the meantime the despots\r\nwere to have their innings.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESTRUCTION OF THE FRENCH EMPIRE\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Weaknesses in the French Empire of Napoleon]\r\n[Sidenote: 1. Napoleon Himself]\r\n\r\nFrom 1808 to 1814--six dreadful years--Napoleon's power was constantly\r\non the wane. Nor are the reasons for his ultimate failure difficult to\r\nperceive. Some of the very elements which had contributed most to the\r\nupbuilding of his great empire with its dependent kingdoms and duchies\r\nwere in the long run elements of weakness and instability--vital causes\r\nof its eventual downfall. In the first place, there was the factor of\r\nindividual genius. Altogether too much depended upon the physical and\r\nmental strength of one man. Napoleon was undoubtedly a genius, but\r\nstill he was human. He was growing older, more corpulent, less able to\r\nwithstand exertion and fatigue, fonder of affluence and ease. On the\r\nother hand, every fresh success had confirmed his belief in his own\r\nability and had further whetted his appetite for power until his\r\nambition was growing into madness and his egotism was becoming mania.\r\nHis aversion from taking the advice of others increased so that even\r\nthe subtle intriguers, Talleyrand and Fouché, were less and less\r\nadmitted to his confidence. The emperor would brook the appearance of\r\nno actor on the French stage other than himself, although on that stage\r\nduring those crowded years there was too much for a single emperor,\r\nalbeit a master emperor, to do.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 2. Defects of Militarism]\r\n\r\nThe second serious defect in the Napoleonic system was the fact that\r\nits very foundation was military. What had enabled the National\r\nConvention in the days of the Revolution's darkest peril to roll back\r\nthe tide of foreign invasion was the heroism and devotion of an\r\nenthusiastic citizen soldiery, actuated by a solemn consciousness that\r\nin a very literal sense they were fighting for their fields and\r\nfiresides, for the rights of men and of Frenchmen. They constituted\r\ncompact and homogeneous armies, inspired by the principles and words of\r\nRouget de Lisle's rousing battle hymn, and they smote the hired\r\ntroopers of the banded despots hip and thigh. It was this kind of an\r\narmy which Napoleon Bonaparte took over and which had earned for him\r\nhis first spectacular successes. He certainly tried to preserve its\r\nRevolutionary enthusiasm throughout his career. He talked much of its\r\n\"mission\" and its \"destiny,\" of liberty, equality, and fraternity, and\r\nhe kept alive its traditions of heroism and duty. He even improved its\r\ndiscipline, its material well-being, and its honor. But gradually,\r\nalmost imperceptibly, the altruistic ideals of the Revolution gave way\r\nin the French army to the more selfish and more Napoleonic ideal of\r\nglamour and glory. And as years passed by and the deadly campaigns\r\nrepeated themselves and the number of patriotic volunteers lessened,\r\nNapoleon resorted more and more to conscription--forcibly taking away\r\nthousands of young Frenchmen from peaceful and productive pursuits at\r\nhome and strewing their bones throughout the length and breadth of the\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 3. Reaction of Nationalism]\r\n\r\nNor did Napoleon's army remain homogeneous. To the last its kernel was\r\nFrench, but, as the empire expanded and other peoples were brought into\r\na dependent or allied position, it came to include regiments or\r\ncompanies of Poles, Germans, Italians, Dutch, Spaniards, and Danes. In\r\nits newer heterogeneous condition it tended the more to lose its\r\noriginal character and to assume that of an enormous machine-like\r\nconglomeration of mercenaries who followed the fortunes of a despot\r\nmore tyrannical and more dangerous than any of the despots against whom\r\nit had at first been pitted. It is true that many of the Frenchmen who\r\ncomposed the kernel of the Grand Army still entertained the notion that\r\nthey were fighting for liberty, equality, and fraternity, and that\r\ntheir contact with their fellow-soldiers and likewise with their\r\nenemies was a most effective means of communicating the revolutionary\r\ndoctrines to Europe, but it is also true that Napoleon's policy of\r\nquartering his troops upon the lands of his enemies or of his allies,\r\nand thereby conserving the resources of his own country, operated to\r\ndevelop the utmost hatred for the French, for the Revolution, and for\r\nNapoleon. This hatred produced, particularly in Germany and in Spain, a\r\nreal patriotic feeling among the masses of the exploited nations, so\r\nthat those very peoples to whom the notions of liberty and equality had\r\nfirst come as a blessed promise of deliverance from the oppression of\r\ntheir own divine-right rulers now used the same notions to justify them\r\nin rising as nations against the despotism of a foreign military\r\noppressor. Liberty, equality, and fraternity--the gospel of the\r\nRevolution--was the boomerang which Napoleon by means of his army\r\nhurled against the European tyrants and which returned with redoubled\r\nforce against him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 4. \"The Continental System\"]\r\n\r\nIt was thus the character of the emperor himself and his military\r\nexigencies that, taken in conjunction with the so-called \"Continental\r\nSystem\" and the national revolts, made Napoleon's empire but an episode\r\nin the story of modern times. It is now time to explain the Continental\r\nSystem and then to see how it reacted throughout Europe upon the\r\nfeeling of national patriotism to bring about the downfall of the\r\nCorsican adventurer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Economic War between Great Britain and France]\r\n\r\n\"Continental System\" is the term commonly applied to the curious\r\ncharacter which the warfare between Napoleon and Great Britain\r\ngradually assumed. By 1806 the interesting situation had developed that\r\nGreat Britain was indisputable mistress of the seas while Napoleon was\r\nno less indisputable master of the Continent. The battles of the Nile,\r\nof Copenhagen, and of Trafalgar had been to the British what those of\r\nMarengo, Austerlitz, and Jena had been to the French. On one hand the\r\ndestruction of the French fleet, together with the Danish, Dutch, and\r\nSpanish squadrons, had effectually prevented Napoleon from carrying\r\ninto practice his long-cherished dream of invading England. On the\r\nother hand, the British army was not strong enough to cope successfully\r\nwith Napoleon on land, and the European Powers which all along had been\r\nsubsidized by English gold had been cowed into submission by the French\r\nemperor. Apparently neither France nor Great Britain could strike each\r\nother by ordinary military means, and yet neither would sue for peace.\r\nWilliam Pitt died in January, 1806, heart-broken by the news of\r\nAusterlitz, the ruin of all his hopes. Charles James Fox, the gifted\r\nWhig, who thereupon became British foreign secretary, was foiled in a\r\nsincere attempt to negotiate peace with Napoleon, and died in September\r\nof the same year, despairing of any amicable settlement.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant French victory at Jena in October, 1806, seemed to fill\r\nthe British as well as the Prussian cup to overflowing. The very next\r\nmonth Napoleon followed up his successes by inaugurating a\r\nthoroughgoing campaign against his arch-enemy, Great Britain herself;\r\nbut the campaign was to be conducted in the field of economics rather\r\nthan in the purview of military science. England, it must be\r\nremembered, had become, thanks to the long series of dynastic and\r\ncolonial wars that filled the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the\r\nchief commercial nation of the world: she had a larger number of\r\ncitizens who made their living as ship-owners, sailors, and traders\r\nthan any other country in the world. Then, too, as we shall see in a\r\nsubsequent chapter, it was in the England of the eighteenth century\r\nthat the Industrial Revolution began,--a marvelous improvement in\r\nmanufacturing, which fostered the growth of a powerful industrial class\r\nand enabled the English to make goods more cheaply and in greater\r\nprofusion and to sell them more readily, at lower prices, both at home\r\nand abroad, than any other people in the world. Industry was fast\r\nbecoming the basis of Great Britain's wealth, and the commercial\r\nclasses were acquiring new strength and influence. It was, therefore,\r\nagainst \"a nation of shopkeepers,\" as Napoleon contemptuously dubbed\r\nthe English, that he must direct his new campaign.\r\n\r\nTo Napoleon's clear and logical mind, the nature of the problem was\r\nplain. Deprived of a navy and unable to utilize his splendid army, he\r\nmust attack Great Britain in what appeared to be her one vulnerable\r\nspot--in her commerce and industry. If he could prevent the importation\r\nof British goods into the Continent, he would deprive his rivals of the\r\nchief markets for their products, ruin British manufacturers, throw\r\nthousands of British workingmen out of employment, create such hard\r\ntimes in the British Islands that the mass of the people would rise\r\nagainst their government and compel it to make peace with him on his\r\nown terms: in a word, he would ruin British commerce and industry and\r\nthen secure an advantageous peace. It was a gigantic gamble, for\r\nNapoleon must have perceived that the Continental peoples might\r\nthemselves oppose the closure of their ports to the cheaper and better\r\nmanufactured articles of Great Britain and might respond to a common\r\neconomic impulse and rise in force to compel him to make peace on\r\nBritish terms, but the stakes were high and the emperor of the French\r\nwas a good gambler. From 1806 to 1812 the struggle between Napoleon and\r\nGreat Britain was an economic endurance-test. On the one hand, the\r\nquestion was whether the British government could retain the support of\r\nthe British people. On the other hand, the question was whether\r\nNapoleon could rely upon the cooperation of the whole Continent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Berlin and Milan Decrees]\r\n\r\nThe Continental System had been foreshadowed under the Directory and in\r\nthe early years of the Consulate, but it was not until the Berlin\r\nDecree (November, 1806) that the first great attempt was made to define\r\nand enforce it. In this decree, Napoleon proclaimed a state of blockade\r\nagainst the British Isles and closed French and allied ports to ships\r\ncoming from Great Britain or her colonies. The Berlin Decree was\r\nsubsequently strengthened and extended by decrees at Warsaw (January,\r\n1807), Milan (December, 1807), and Fontainebleau (October, 1810). The\r\nMilan Decree provided that even neutral vessels sailing from any\r\nBritish port or from countries occupied by British troops might be\r\nseized by French warships or privateers. The Fontainebleau Decree went\r\nso far as to order the confiscation and public burning of all British\r\nmanufactured goods found in the Napoleonic States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Orders in Council]\r\n\r\nTo these imperial decrees the British government, now largely dominated\r\nby such statesmen as Lord Castlereagh and George Canning, replied with\r\ncelebrated Orders in Council (January-November, 1807), which declared\r\nall vessels trading with France or her allies liable to capture and\r\nprovided further that in certain instances neutral vessels must touch\r\nat a British port. Thus the issue was squarely joined. Napoleon would\r\nsuffer no importation of British goods whether by combatants or by\r\nneutrals. The British would allow none but themselves to trade with\r\nFrance and her allies. In both cases the neutrals would be the worst\r\nsufferers. The effects of the conflict were destined to be far-\r\nreaching.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difficulties in Maintaining the Continental System]\r\n\r\nThe British by virtue of their sea-power could come nearer to enforcing\r\ntheir Orders in Council than could Napoleon to giving full effect to\r\nhis imperial decrees. Of course they had their troubles with neutrals.\r\nThe stubborn effort of Denmark to preserve its independence of action\r\nin politics and trade was frustrated in 1807 when a British expedition\r\nbombarded Copenhagen and seized the remnant of the Danish navy. From\r\nthat time until 1814 Denmark was naturally a stanch ally of Napoleon.\r\nAgainst the Americans, too, who took advantage of the Continental\r\nSystem to draw into their own hands a liberal portion of the carrying\r\ntrade, the British vigorously applied the Orders in Council, and the\r\nconsequent ill-feeling culminated in the War of 1812 between Great\r\nBritain and the United States. But on the whole, the British had less\r\ntrouble with neutrals than did Napoleon. And compared with the\r\nprodigious hardships which the System imposed upon the Continental\r\npeoples and the consequent storms of popular opposition to its author,\r\nthe contemporaneous distress in England was never acute; and the\r\nBritish nation at large never seriously wavered in affording moral and\r\nmaterial support to their hard-pressed government.\r\n\r\nHere was the failure of Napoleon. It proved physically impossible for\r\nhim to extend the Continental System widely and thoroughly enough to\r\ngain his point. In many cases, to stave off opposition, he authorized\r\nexceptions to his own decrees. If he could have prevailed upon every\r\nContinental state to close its ports to British goods simultaneously\r\nand for several successive years, he would still have been confronted\r\nwith a difficult task to prevent smuggling and the bribery of customs\r\nofficials, which reached large proportions even in France and in the\r\nsurrounding states that he had under fairly effective control. But to\r\nbring all Continental states into line with his economic campaign\r\nagainst Great Britain was a colossal task, to the performance of which\r\nhe subordinated all his subsequent policies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Subordination of Napoleon's Foreign Policies to the\r\nEnforcement of the Continental System]\r\n\r\nWe have seen how by the treaty of Tilsit (1807) Napoleon extorted\r\npromises from the tsar of Russia and the king of Prussia to exclude\r\nBritish goods from their respective countries. He himself saw to the\r\nenforcement of the decrees in the French Empire, in the kingdom of\r\nItaly, in the Confederation of the Rhine, and in the grand-duchy of\r\nWarsaw. Brother Joseph did his will in Naples, Brother Jerome in\r\nWestphalia, Sister Elise in Tuscany, and Brother Louis was expected to\r\ndo his will in Holland. The outcome of the war with Sweden in 1808 was\r\nthe completion of the closure of all Scandinavian ports to the British.\r\nNapoleon's determination to have his decrees executed in the Papal\r\nStates, as well as his high-handed treatment of matters affecting the\r\nCatholic Church in France, brought him into conflict with Pope Pius\r\nVII, a gentle but courageous man, who in daring to excommunicate the\r\nEuropean taskmaster was summarily deprived of his temporal rule and\r\ncarried off a prisoner, first to Grenoble, then to Savona, and finally\r\nto Fontainebleau, where he resided, heaped with disgrace and insults,\r\nuntil 1814. In 1809 Napoleon formally incorporated the Papal States\r\ninto the French Empire. And when in the next year Louis Bonaparte gave\r\nclear signs of an intention to promote the best interests of his Dutch\r\nsubjects, even to his brother's detriment, by admitting British goods,\r\nhe was peremptorily deposed, and Holland, too, was incorporated into\r\nthe ever-enlarging French Empire. Henceforth, the Dutch had to bear the\r\nburdens of conscription and of crushing taxation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Napoleon's Interference in Portugal]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Napoleon was devoting special attention to closing Portugal\r\nand Spain to British goods, and political conditions in these countries\r\nseemed to favor his designs. For over a hundred years Portugal had been\r\nlinked in close trade relations with England, ever since the Methuen\r\nTreaty of 1703, which, in return for the admission of English woolens\r\ninto Portugal, had granted differential duties favoring the importation\r\nof Portuguese wines into England and had thus provided a good market\r\nfor an important Portuguese product to the exclusion largely of the\r\nFrench. Napoleon, early in his public career, had tried, for a time\r\nsuccessfully, [Footnote: In 1801, as First Consul, Napoleon had\r\nprevailed upon Spain to attack Portugal in order to secure the\r\nrepudiation of the Methuen Treaty and the promise of hostility to Great\r\nBritain. This step had proved fatal to Portuguese trade, and in 1804\r\nthe Portuguese government had purchased from Napoleon a solemn\r\nrecognition of neutrality.] to break these commercial relations between\r\nGreat Britain and Portugal, but it was not until after Tilsit that he\r\nentered seriously upon the work. He then formally demanded the\r\nadherence of Portugal to the Continental System and the seizure of all\r\nBritish subjects and property within the kingdom. Prince John, the\r\nregent of the small country, protested, besought Great Britain for aid,\r\nhesitated, and finally refused. Already a Franco-Spanish army was on\r\nits way to force compliance with the emperor's demands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and in Spain]\r\n\r\nIn the court of the Spanish Bourbons was a situation that Napoleon\r\ncould readily utilize in order to have his way both in Portugal and in\r\nSpain. On the throne of Spain was seated the aging Charles IV (1788-\r\n1808), boorish, foolish, easily duped. By his side sat his queen, a\r\ncoarse sensuous woman \"with a tongue like a fishwife's.\" Their heir was\r\nPrince Ferdinand, a conceited irresponsible young braggart in his early\r\ntwenties. And their favorite, the true ruler of Spain, if Spain at this\r\ntime could be said to have a ruler, was Godoy, a vain flashy\r\nadventurer, who was loved by the queen, shielded by the king, and\r\nenvied by the heir. Under such a combination it is not strange that\r\nSpain from 1795 to 1808 was but a vassal state to France. Nor is it\r\nstrange that Napoleon was able in 1807 to secure the approval of the\r\nSpanish king to the partition of Portugal, a liberal share having been\r\nallotted to the precious Godoy.\r\n\r\nThus French troops were suffered to pour across Spain, and, in October,\r\n1807, to invade Portugal. On 1 December, Lisbon was occupied and the\r\nContinental System proclaimed in force, but on the preceding day the\r\nPortuguese royal family escaped and, under convoy of a British fleet,\r\nset sail for their distant colony of Brazil. Then it was that\r\nNapoleon's true intentions in regard to Spain as well as to Portugal\r\nbecame evident.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Joseph Bonaparte, King of Spain, 1808]\r\n\r\nFrench troops continued to cross the Pyrenees and to possess themselves\r\nof the whole Iberian peninsula. In Spain public opinion blamed the\r\nfeeble king and the detested favorite for this profanation of the\r\ncountry's soil, and in the recriminations that ensued at court Prince\r\nFerdinand warmly espoused the popular side. Riots followed. Charles IV,\r\nto save Godoy, abdicated and proclaimed Ferdinand VII (17 March, 1808).\r\nOn the pretext of mediating between the rival factions in the Bourbon\r\ncourt, Napoleon lured Charles and Ferdinand and Godoy to Bayonne on the\r\nFrench frontier and there by threats and cajolery compelled both king\r\nand prince to resign all claims upon their throne. Charles retired to\r\nRome on a pension from Napoleon; Ferdinand was kept for six years under\r\nstrict military guard at Talleyrand's château; the Bourbons had ceased\r\nto reign. Brother Joseph Bonaparte was at once promoted to the throne\r\nof Spain, and Brother-in-law Joachim Murat supplanted him as king of\r\nNaples.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1808, under protection of French troops, Joseph Bonaparte was\r\ncrowned at Madrid. Forthwith he proceeded to confer upon his new\r\nsubjects the favors of the Napoleonic régime: he decreed equality\r\nbefore the law, individual liberties, abolition of feudalism and\r\nserfdom, educational reforms, suppression of the Inquisition,\r\ndiminution of monasteries, confiscation of church property, public\r\nimprovements, and, last but not least, the vigorous enforcement of the\r\nContinental System.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Resistance in Spain]\r\n\r\nThe comparative ease with which Napoleon had thus been able to supplant\r\nthe Spanish Bourbons was equaled only by the difficulty which he and\r\nhis brother now experienced with the Spanish people. Until 1808 the\r\nCorsican adventurer had had to deal primarily with divine-right\r\nmonarchs and their old-fashioned mercenary armies; henceforth he was\r\nconfronted with real nations, inspired by the same solid patriotism\r\nwhich had inspirited the French and dominated by much the same\r\nrevolutionary fervor. The Spanish people despised their late king as\r\nweak and traitorous; they hated their new king as a foreigner and an\r\nupstart. For Spain they were patriotic to the core: priests and nobles\r\nmade common cause with commoners and peasants, and all agreed that they\r\nwould not brook foreign interference with their domestic concerns. All\r\nSpain blazed forth in angry insurrection. Revolutionary committees, or\r\n_juntas_, were speedily organized in the provinces; troops were\r\nenrolled; and a nationalist reaction was in full swing. By 1 August,\r\n1808, Joseph was obliged to flee from Madrid and the French troops were\r\nin retreat toward the Pyrenees,\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Interrelation of the Continental System and Spanish\r\nNationalism]\r\n[Sidenote: The Peninsular War, 1808-1813]\r\n\r\nTo add to the discomfiture of the French, George Canning, the British\r\nforeign minister, promptly promised his country's active assistance to\r\na movement whose real significance he already clearly perceived. In\r\nringing words he laid down the British policy which would obtain until\r\nNapoleon had been overthrown: \"We shall proceed upon the principle that\r\nany nation of Europe which starts up to oppose a Power which, whether\r\nprofessing insidious peace or declaring open war, is the common enemy\r\nof all nations, becomes instantly our ally.\" On 1 August, 1808, true to\r\nthis declaration, a British army under the command of Sir Arthur\r\nWellesley, subsequently duke of Wellington, landed in Portugal and\r\nproceeded to cooperate with Portuguese and Spanish against the French.\r\nIt was the beginning of the so-called Peninsular War, which, with\r\nlittle interruption, was to last until 1813 and to spell the first\r\ndisasters for Napoleon.\r\n\r\nWithin three weeks after their landing the British were in possession\r\nof Portugal. Roused by this unexpected reverse, Napoleon assumed\r\npersonal command of the French forces in the Peninsula. And such was\r\nhis vigor and resourcefulness that in December, 1808, he reinstated\r\nJoseph in Madrid and drove the main British army out of Spain. The\r\nsuccess of Napoleon, however, was but temporary and illusory. Early in\r\n1809 grave developments in another part of Europe called him away from\r\nSpain, and the marshals, whom he left behind, quarreled with one\r\nanother and at the same time experienced to the full the difficulties\r\nwhich Napoleon himself would have encountered had he remained.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties which impeded French military operations in the\r\nIberian peninsula were well-nigh insurmountable. The nature of the\r\ncountry furnished several unusual obstacles. In the first place, the\r\npoverty of the farms and the paucity of settlements created a scarcity\r\nof provisions and rendered it difficult for the French armies to resort\r\nto their customary practice of living upon the land. Secondly, the\r\nsudden alternations of heat and cold, to which the northern part of\r\nSpain is liable, coupled with the insanitary condition of many of the\r\ntowns, spread disease among the French soldiery. Finally, the\r\nsuccession of fairly high and steep mountain ranges, which cross the\r\nPeninsula generally in a direction of northwest to southeast, prevented\r\nany campaigning on the large scale to which Napoleonic tactics were\r\naccustomed, and put a premium upon loose, irregular guerrilla fighting,\r\nin which the Spaniards were adepts. In connection with these obstacles\r\narising from the nature of the country must be remembered the fierce\r\npatriotic determination of the native people and the arms and\r\ndisciplined commanders furnished by the British.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nationalism in Austria]\r\n[Sidenote: Premature Efforts of Austria]\r\n[Sidenote: Wagram (1809) and the Failure of Austria]\r\n\r\nThe era of national revolts had dawned, and it was not long before\r\nAustria learned the lesson from Spain. Ever since 1792 the Austrian\r\nruler had borne the brunt of the Continental warfare against\r\nrevolutionary France. And stung by the disasters and humiliations of\r\n1805 and 1806, the Emperor Francis intrusted preparations for a war of\r\nrevenge to the Archduke Charles and to Count Stadion, an able statesman\r\nand diplomat. The immediate results were: first, a far-reaching scheme\r\nof military reform, which abolished the obsolete methods of the\r\neighteenth century, the chief characteristics of the new order being\r\nthe adoption of the principle of the \"nation in arms\" and of the war\r\norganization and tactics in use among the French; and secondly, the\r\nawakening of a lively and enthusiastic feeling of patriotism among the\r\nAustrian people, especially among the Tyrolese, whom the arbitrary act\r\nof the French despot had handed over to Bavaria. The opportunity for an\r\neffective stroke appeared to be afforded by the Spanish situation, and\r\nthe general result was a desperate attempt, premature as the event\r\nproved, to overthrow Napoleon. On 9 April, 1809, Austria declared war,\r\nand the next day Archduke Charles with a splendid army advanced into\r\nBavaria. Napoleon, who temporarily put the Spanish danger out of his\r\nmind, struck the archduke with his usual lightning rapidity, and within\r\na week's time had forced him back upon Vienna. Before the middle of May\r\nthe French emperor was once more in the Austrian capital. But the\r\nArchduke Charles remained resolute, and on 21-22 May inflicted such a\r\nreverse on Napoleon at Aspern on the Danube below Vienna, that, had\r\nthere been prompt cooperation on the part of other Austrian commanders\r\nand speedy assistance from other states, the Corsican might then have\r\nbeen overthrown and Europe saved from a vaster deluge of blood. As it\r\nwas, Napoleon was allowed a fateful breathing spell, and on 5-6 July he\r\nfought and won the hard battle of Wagram. Wagram was not a rout like\r\nAusterlitz, but it was sufficiently decisive to induce the Austrian\r\nemperor to accept an armistice, and, after the failure of a coöperating\r\nBritish expedition, to conclude the treaty of Vienna or Schönbrunn (14\r\nOctober, 1809), by the terms of which he had to surrender western\r\nGalicia to the grand-duchy of Warsaw and eastern Galicia to Russia; to\r\ncede the Illyrian provinces to the French Empire; and to restore the\r\nTyrol, together with a strip of Upper Austria, to Bavaria. This treaty\r\ncost Austria four and one-half million subjects, a heavy war indemnity,\r\nand promises not to maintain an army in excess of 150,000 men, nor to\r\nhave commercial dealings with Great Britain. As a further pledge of\r\nAustria's good behavior, and in order to assure a direct heir to his\r\ngreatness, Napoleon shortly afterwards secured an annulment of his\r\nmarriage with Josephine on the ground that it had not been solemnized\r\nin the presence of a parish priest, and early in 1810 he married a\r\nyoung Austrian archduchess, Maria Louisa, the daughter of the Emperor\r\nFrancis II. Even this venture at first seemed successful, for in the\r\nfollowing year a son was born who received the high-sounding\r\nappellation of king of Rome. But Austria remained at heart thoroughly\r\nhostile; Maria Louisa later grew faithless; and the young prince, half-\r\nHabsburg and half-Bonaparte, was destined to drag out a weary and\r\nfutile existence among enemies and spies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of the French Revolution upon Prussia]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the national reaction against Napoleon grew apace. It was in\r\nPrussia that it reached more portentous dimensions than even in Austria\r\nor in Spain. Following so closely upon the invigorating victories of\r\nFrederick the Great, the disaster of Jena and the humiliation of Tilsit\r\nhad been a doubly bitter cup for the Prussian people. Prussian\r\nstatesmen were not lacking who put the blame for their country's\r\ndegradation upon many of the social and political conditions which had\r\ncharacterized the \"old régime\" in all European monarchies, and, as\r\nthese statesmen were called in counsel by the well-intentioned King\r\nFrederick William III (1797-1840), the years from 1807 to 1813 were\r\nmarked by a series of internal reforms almost as significant in the\r\nhistory of Prussia as were those from 1789 to 1795 in the history of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Regeneration of Prussia]\r\n\r\nThe credit of the Prussian regeneration belongs mainly to the great\r\nminister, the Baron vom Stein (1757-1831), and in the second place to\r\nthe Chancellor Hardenberg (1750-1822), both of whom felt the influence\r\nof English ideas and of the French philosophy of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. On 9 October, 1807, Stein issued at Memel the famous Edict of\r\nEmancipation, which abolished the institution of serfdom throughout\r\nPrussia. Free trade in land was established, and land was left free to\r\npass from hand to hand and class to class. Thus the Prussian peasants\r\nbecame personally free, although they were still bound to make fixed\r\npayments to their lords as rent. Moreover, all occupations and\r\nprofessions were thrown open to noble, commoner, and peasant alike.\r\nStein's second important step was to strengthen the cabinet and to\r\nintroduce sweeping changes in the conduct of public business, reforms\r\ntoo complicated and too technical to receive detailed explanation in\r\nthis place. His third great measure was the grant (19 November, 1808)\r\nof local self-government, on liberal yet practical lines, to all\r\nPrussian towns and villages with a population in excess of 800. Stein\r\nundoubtedly intended the last law to be a corner-stone in the edifice\r\nof national constitutional government which he longed to erect in his\r\ncountry, but in this respect his plans were thwarted and Prussia\r\nremained another two generations without a written constitution. In\r\n1811 Hardenberg continued the reform of the condition of the peasants\r\nby making them absolute owners of part of their holdings, the landlords\r\nobtaining the rest as partial compensation for their lost feudal and\r\nservile dues. During the same period, the army was likewise reorganized\r\nby Scharnhorst and Gneisenau; compulsory universal service was\r\nintroduced, while the condition imposed by Napoleon that the army\r\nshould not exceed 42,000 men was practically evaded by replacing each\r\nbody of 42,000 men by another of the same size as soon as the first was\r\nfairly versed in military affairs. In this way every able-bodied male\r\nPrussian was in preparation for an expected War of Liberation.\r\n\r\nOf course Napoleon had some idea of what was happening in Prussia: he\r\nprotested, he threatened, he actually succeeded late in 1808 in\r\nsecuring the dismissal of Stein. But the redoubtable Prussian reformer\r\nspent the next three years in trying to fan the popular flame in\r\nAustria and thence betook himself to Russia to poison the ear and mind\r\nof the Tsar Alexander against the emperor of the French. In the\r\nmeantime Napoleon was far too busy with other matters to give thorough\r\nattention to the continued development of the popular reforms in\r\nPrussia. There the national spirit burned ever brighter through the\r\nexertions of patriotic societies, such as the _Tugendbund_, or\r\n\"League of Virtue,\" through the writings of men like Fichte and Arndt,\r\nand, perhaps most permanently of all, through the wonderful educational\r\nreforms, which, associated indissolubly with the name of Wilhelm von\r\nHumboldt (1767-1835), gave to Prussia the basis of her present common-\r\nschool system and to the world the great University of Berlin (1809).\r\n\r\nIt was no longer true that the French had a monopoly of the blessed\r\nprinciples of liberty, equality, and fraternity, for which to fight. It\r\nwas no longer a fact that they were the only nation defending their\r\nhomes, their lands, and their rights. By 1810 the despotism of Napoleon\r\nwas more selfish and more directly galling to the Prussian people than\r\nhad been the threatened tyranny of Austrian and Prussian monarchs to an\r\nemancipated French nation in the dark days of 1792. Prussia was\r\nbankrupt, shorn of half her provinces, enduring the quartering of\r\nforeign soldiers, and suffering the ruin of her crops and the paralysis\r\nof her trade. Thanks to the Continental System, which had been none of\r\ntheir doing, the Prussian people witnessed the decay of their seaports,\r\nthe rotting of their ships in their harbors, paid exorbitant prices for\r\ntobacco, and denied themselves sugar, coffee, and spices. They were\r\ngrumbling and getting into a temper that boded ill to the author of\r\ntheir injuries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Liberalism in Spain]\r\n[Sidenote: The Spanish Constitution of 1812]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the warfare in Spain dragged on. In 1812 Wellington with his\r\nallied British and Spanish troops won the great victory of Salamanca,\r\ncaptured Madrid, and drove Joseph and the French north to Valencia. In\r\nthe same year radical groups of Spaniards, who had learned\r\nrevolutionary doctrines from the French, assembled at Cadiz and drafted\r\na constitution for what they hoped would be their regenerated country.\r\nThis written constitution, next in age to the American and the French,\r\nwas more radical than either and long served as a model for liberal\r\nconstitutions throughout southern Europe. After a preamble in honor of\r\nthe \"old fundamental laws of this monarchy,\" the constitution laid down\r\nthe very principle of the Revolution: \"Sovereignty is vested\r\nessentially in the nation, and accordingly it is to the nation\r\nexclusively that the right of making its fundamental laws belongs.\" The\r\nlegislative power was intrusted to the Cortes, a single-chamber\r\nparliament elected for two years by indirect universal suffrage. The\r\nexecutive power was given to the king to be exercised by his ministers.\r\nThe king could affix a suspensive veto to the acts of the Cortes. The\r\nconstitution further proclaimed the principles of individual liberty\r\nand legal equality and sought to abolish the old régime root and\r\nbranch: provision was made for a thorough reorganization of courts,\r\nlocal administration, taxation, the army, and public education. While\r\nthe framers of the constitution affirmed that \"the religion of the\r\nSpanish nation is and always will be the Apostolic Church of Rome, the\r\nonly true Church,\" they persisted in decreeing the suppression of the\r\nInquisition and the secularization of ecclesiastical property. That\r\nsuch a radical constitution would be understood and championed\r\nforthwith by the whole Spanish people, only the most confirmed and\r\nfanatical optimist could believe, but, on the other hand, it was\r\ncertain that the Spaniards as a nation were resolved that the\r\nContinental System and the Bonaparte family must go. They might\r\nsacrifice equality but not national liberty.\r\n\r\nAt last the four fateful defects in the Napoleonic Empire,--the\r\ncharacter of Napoleon himself, the nature of his army, the Continental\r\nSystem, and the rise of nationalism,--were painfully in evidence. The\r\ndrama thenceforth led irresistibly through two terrible acts--the\r\nRussian campaign and the Battle of the Nations--to the\r\n_dénouement_ in the emperor's abdication and to a sorry epilogue\r\nin Waterloo.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Strained Relations between Napoleon and Tsar Alexander]\r\n\r\nIt was the rupture between Napoleon and the Tsar Alexander that\r\nprecipitated the disasters. A number of events which transpired between\r\nthe celebrated meeting at Tilsit in 1807 and the memorable year of 1812\r\nmade a rupture inevitable. Tilsit had purported to divide the world\r\nbetween the two emperors, but Alexander, as junior partner in the firm,\r\nsoon found that his chief function was to assist Napoleon in bringing\r\nall western and central Europe under the domination of the French\r\nEmpire while he himself was allowed by no means a free rein in dealing\r\nwith his own country's hereditary enemies--Sweden, Poland, and Turkey.\r\nTo be sure, Alexander had wrested Finland from Sweden (1809), but\r\nNapoleon's forcing of Sweden into a war with Great Britain (1810-1812),\r\npresumably as an ally of Russia as well as of France, had prevented him\r\nfrom extending his territory further in that direction. Then, too, the\r\nrevival of a Polish state under the name of the grand-duchy of Warsaw\r\nand under French protection was a thorn in his flesh, which became all\r\nthe more painful, more irritating, when it was enlarged after the\r\nAustrian War of 1809. Finally, Alexander's warfare against Turkey was\r\nconstantly handicapped by French diplomacy, so that when the treaty of\r\nBucharest was at length concluded (28 May, 1812) it was due to British\r\nrather than to French assistance that Russia extended her southern\r\nboundary to the River Pruth. Alexander was particularly piqued when\r\nNapoleon dethroned one of the tsar's relatives in Oldenburg and\r\narbitrarily annexed that duchy to the French Empire, and he was deeply\r\nchagrined when the marriage of his ally with a Habsburg archduchess\r\nseemed to cement the bonds between France and Austria.\r\n\r\nAll these political differences might conceivably have been adjusted,\r\nhad it not been for the economic breach which the Continental System\r\never widened. Russia, at that time almost exclusively an agricultural\r\ncountry, had special need of British imports, and the tsar, a\r\nsympathetic, kind-hearted man, could not endure the suffering and\r\nprotests of his people. The result was a gradual suspension of the\r\nrigors of the Continental System in Russia and the eventual return to\r\nnormal trade relations as they had existed prior to Tilsit. This simple\r\nfact Napoleon could not and would not recognize. \"Russia's partial\r\nabandonment of the Continental System was not merely a pretext but the\r\nreal ground of the war. Napoleon had no alternative between fighting\r\nfor his system and abandoning the only method open to him of carrying\r\non war against England.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Preparations for War between France and Russia]\r\n\r\nBy the opening of the year 1812 Napoleon was actively preparing for war\r\non a large scale against his recent ally. From the Austrian court,\r\nthanks to his wife, he secured assurances of sympathy and the promise\r\nof a guard of 30,000 men to protect the right wing of his Russian\r\ninvasion. From the trembling Prussian king he wrung, by threats,\r\npermission to lead his invaders across Prussian soil and the support of\r\n20,000 troopers for the left of his lines. A huge expedition was then\r\ngathered together: some 250,000 French veterans, 150,000 Germans from\r\nthe Confederation of the Rhine; 80,000 Italians; 60,000 Poles; and\r\ndetachments of Dutch, Swiss, Danes, and Serbo-Croats; in all, a mighty\r\nmotley host of more than 600,000 men.\r\n\r\nAs the year advanced, the Tsar Alexander made counter preparations. He\r\ncame to a formal understanding with Great Britain. Through British\r\nmediation he made peace with the Turks and thus removed an enemy from\r\nhis flank. And a series of treaties between himself, Great Britain, and\r\nMarshal Bernadotte, who was crown-prince of Sweden and tired of\r\nNapoleonic domination, guaranteed him in possession of Finland, assured\r\nhim of a supporting Swedish army, and in return promised Norway as\r\ncompensation to Sweden. A well-trained Russian army of 400,000 men,\r\nunder the stubborn, taciturn veteran, General Kutusov, was put in the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Napoleon's Russian Campaign, 1812]\r\n\r\nWar seemed imminent by April, 1812. After leisurely completing his\r\npreparations, Napoleon crossed the Niemen on 24 June, and the invasion\r\nof Russia had begun. It was the plan of the French emperor either to\r\nsmash his enemy in a single great battle and to force an early\r\nadvantageous treaty, or, advancing slowly, to spend the winter in\r\nLithuania, inciting the people to insurrection, and then in the\r\nfollowing summer to march on to Moscow and there in the ancient capital\r\nof the tsars to dictate terms of peace. The Russian plan of campaign\r\nwas quite different. The tsar knew his people, that they were deeply\r\nreligious and patriotic, that they hated Napoleon bitterly, and that\r\nthey could be trusted not to revolt. He likewise knew well the\r\ncharacter of the 800 miles of comparatively barren steppes that\r\nintervened between the Niemen and Moscow, whereon small armies could be\r\nbeaten and large ones starved. Against the _Grande Armée_\r\ntherefore, Alexander directed that no decisive battle be risked, but\r\nthat the Russian forces, always retreating, should draw their opponents\r\non as far as possible into the interior of the country, where the\r\nrigors and privations of a Russian winter could be expected to work\r\ngreater havoc among them than could powder and bullets.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise and uneasiness, therefore, Napoleon after crossing the\r\nNiemen found the Russians always retreating before his advance. No\r\ndecisive victory could be won against the elusive foe. Nor was the\r\ntemper of the Lithuanians such as to encourage him to remain all winter\r\namong them. Pushing on into Russia, he captured the great fortress of\r\nSmolensk but still failed to crush the main Russian army. Then it was\r\nthat he made the momentous decision to press on at once to Moscow. On 7\r\nSeptember, General Kutusov turned against him at Borodino and inflicted\r\nserious injury upon his army, but a week later he was in possession of\r\nMoscow. The battle of Borodino, together with the perpetual harassing\r\nof his outposts by the retreating Russians, had already inflicted very\r\nsevere losses upon Napoleon, but he still had an army of about 100,000\r\nto quarter in Moscow.\r\n\r\nThe very night of his triumphal entry, the city was set on fire through\r\nthe carelessness of its own inhabitants,--the bazaar, with its stock of\r\nwine, spirits, and chemicals, becoming the prey of the flames. Barracks\r\nand foodstuffs were alike destroyed; the inhabitants fled; what was\r\nleft of the city was pillaged by the French troops as well as by the\r\nRussians themselves; and the burning of Moscow became the signal for a\r\ngeneral rising of the peasants against the foreigners who had brought\r\nsuch evils in their train. The lack of supplies and the impossibility\r\nof wintering in a ruined city, attacked in turn by an enraged peasantry\r\nand by detachments of General Kutusov's army, now comfortably ensconced\r\na short distance to the south, compelled Napoleon on 22 October, after\r\nan unsuccessful attempt to blow up the Kremlin, or citadel, to evacuate\r\nMoscow and to retrace his steps toward the Niemen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Disastrous Retreat from Moscow]\r\n\r\nThe retreat from Moscow is one of the most horrible episodes in all\r\nhistory. To the exasperating and deadly attacks of the victoriously\r\npursuing Russians on the rear were added the severity of the weather\r\nand the barrenness of the country. Steady downpours of rain changed to\r\nblinding storms of sleet and snow. Swollen streams, heaps of abandoned\r\nbaggage, and huge snow-drifts repeatedly blocked the line of march. The\r\ngaunt and desolate country, which the army had ravaged and pillaged\r\nduring the summer's invasion, now grimly mocked the retreating host. It\r\nwas a land truly inhospitable and dreary beyond description. Exhaustion\r\novercame thousands of troopers, who dropped by the wayside and beneath\r\nthe snows gave their bodies to enrich the Russian ground. The retreat\r\nbecame a rout and all would have been lost had it not been for the\r\nalmost superhuman efforts of the valiant rear-guard under Marshal Ney.\r\nAs it was, a mere remnant of the _Grande Armée_ certainly fewer\r\nthan 50,000 men--recrossed the Niemen on 13 December, and, in pitiable\r\nplight, half-starved and with torn uniforms, took refuge in Germany.\r\nFully half a million lives had been sacrificed upon the fields of\r\nRussia to the ambition of one man. Yet in the face of these distressing\r\nfacts, this one man had the unblushing effrontery and overweening\r\negotism to announce to the afflicted French people that \"the emperor\r\nhas never been in better health!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Final Coalition against Napoleon]\r\n\r\nFor a moment the Tsar Alexander hesitated. Russia at least was freed\r\nfrom the Napoleonic peril. To make peace in this hour of triumph might\r\nbe of great advantage to his country and would involve no further risks\r\non his part. But his own dreamy longing to pose as the chief figure on\r\nthe European stage, the deliverer of oppressed nationalities, coupled\r\nwith the insistent promptings of Baron vom Stein, who was always at his\r\nelbow, eventually decided him to complete the overthrow of his rival.\r\nLate in December he signed a convention with the Prussian commander,\r\nGeneral Yorck, whereby the Prussian army was to cooperate with the\r\nRussian, British, and Swedish forces, and, in return, Prussia was to be\r\nrestored to the position it had enjoyed prior to Jena. On 13 January,\r\n1813, Alexander at the head of the Russian troops crossed the Niemen\r\nand proclaimed the liberty of the European peoples. King Frederick\r\nWilliam III, amidst the enthusiastic rejoicing of his people, soon\r\nconfirmed the convention of his general, and in March declared war\r\nagainst Napoleon. The War of Liberation had commenced.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The War of Liberation]\r\n\r\nThe events of the year 1813 were as glorious in the history of Germany\r\nas they were disastrous for the fortunes of Napoleon. Prussia led in\r\nthe movement to free all the German-speaking people from French\r\ndomination. From Prussia the national enthusiasm spread to the other\r\nstates. Mecklenburg, which had been the last addition to the\r\nConfederation of the Rhine, was the first to secede from it. All\r\nnorthern and central Germany was speedily in popular revolt, and the\r\nPrussian army, swelled by many patriotic enlistments, marched southward\r\ninto Saxony. Austria, divided between fear of Napoleon and jealousy of\r\nthe growing power of Russia, mobilized her army and waited for events\r\nto shape her conduct. In these trying circumstances Napoleon acted with\r\nhis accustomed promptness and vigor. Since his arrival in France late\r\nin 1812, he had been frantically engaged in recruiting a new army,\r\nwhich, with the wreck of the _Grande Armée_ and the assistance\r\nthat was still forthcoming from Naples and southern Germany, now\r\nnumbered 200,000 men, and with which he was ready to take the offensive\r\nin Saxony. On 2 May, 1813, he fell on the allied Russians and Prussians\r\nat Lützen and defeated them, but was unable to follow up his advantage\r\nfor want of cavalry. On 20-21 May, he gained another fruitless victory\r\nat Bautzen. It became increasingly obvious that he was being\r\noutnumbered and outmaneuvered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Coalition Joined by Austria]\r\n\r\nAt this point an armistice was arranged through the friendly mediation\r\nof Austria. The government of that country proposed a general European\r\npeace on the basis of the reconstruction of Prussia, the re-partition\r\nof the grand-duchy of Warsaw by Russia, Prussia, and Austria, the re-\r\ncession of the Illyrian provinces to Austria, the dissolution of the\r\nConfederation of the Rhine, and the freedom of the German ports of\r\nHamburg and Lübeck. But it was a decisive victory, not peace, that\r\nNapoleon most wanted, and the only reason which had induced him to\r\naccept the armistice was to gain time in order that reënforcements from\r\nItaly and France might arrive. The delay, however, was fatal to the\r\nFrench emperor, for his reënforcements were greatly outnumbered by the\r\npatriots who were continually flocking to the standards of the allies,\r\nand by 12 August, 1813, when a state of war was resumed, Austria, whose\r\npeace proposals had been rudely rejected, had formally joined the\r\ncoalition against him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Leipzig, the \"Battle of the Nations,\" October 1813]\r\n\r\nNapoleon was now at Dresden in supreme command of armies aggregating\r\nabout 400,000 men, opposed by 250,000 Austrians in Bohemia under\r\nSchwarzenberg; 100,000 Prussians and Russians in Silesia under Blücher;\r\n100,000 Swedes, Prussians, and Russians near Berlin under the Crown\r\nPrince Bernadotte of Sweden; and at least 300,000 reserves. At Dresden,\r\nin August, he won his last great victory, against the Austrian army of\r\nGeneral Schwarzenberg. As his marshals suffered repeated reverses, he\r\nwas unable to follow up his own successes and found himself gradually\r\nhemmed in by the allies, until at Leipzig he turned at bay. There, on\r\n16-19 October, was fought the great three-day \"Battle of the Nations.\"\r\nAgainst the 300,000 troops of the allies, Napoleon could use only\r\n170,000, and of these the Saxon contingent deserted in the heat of the\r\nfray. It was by military prowess that the French Empire had been\r\nreared; its doom was sealed by the battle of Leipzig. Napoleon\r\nsacrificed on that field another 40,000 lives, besides 30,000 prisoners\r\nand a large quantity of artillery and supplies. A fortnight later, with\r\nthe remnant of his army, he recrossed the Rhine. Germany was freed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Collapse of Napoleon's Power outside of France]\r\n\r\nThe \"Battle of the Nations\" following within a year the disasters of\r\nthe retreat from Moscow, marked the collapse of Napoleon's power\r\noutside of France. His empire and vassal states tumbled like a house of\r\ncards. The Confederation of the Rhine dissolved, and its princes\r\nhastened, with a single exception, to throw in their lot with the\r\nvictorious allies. King Jerome Bonaparte was chased out of Westphalia.\r\nHolland was liberated, and William of Orange returned to his country as\r\nking. Denmark submitted and by the treaty of Kiel (January, 1814)\r\nengaged to cede Norway to Sweden in return for a monetary payment and\r\nSwedish Pomerania. Austria readily recovered the Tyrol and the Illyrian\r\nprovinces and occupied Venetia and Switzerland. Even Joachim Murat\r\ndeserted his brother-in-law, and, in order to retain Naples, came to\r\nterms with Austria. Only Polish Warsaw and the king of Saxony remained\r\nloyal to the Napoleonic alliance: the territories of both were in full\r\npossession of the allies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Campaign of 1814 in France]\r\n\r\nWith the remnant of his defeated army and what young boys and old men\r\nhe was able to recruit, Napoleon needlessly prolonged the struggle on\r\nFrench soil. At the close of 1813 Austria prevailed upon her more or\r\nless willing allies to offer him wonderfully favorable terms: France\r\nmight retain her \"natural boundaries\"--the Rhine, the Alps, and the\r\nPyrenees; and Napoleon might continue to rule over a region which would\r\nhave gladdened the heart of a Richelieu or of a Louis XIV. But it was\r\nstill victory and not peace upon which the supreme egotist had bet his\r\nmind. He still dreamed of overwhelming Prussia and Russia.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1814 three large foreign armies, totaling 400,000 men, and\r\naccompanied by the emperors of Russia and Austria and the king of\r\nPrussia, invaded northern France and converged on Paris. Blücher with\r\nhis German troops was advancing up the Moselle to Nancy; Schwarzenberg\r\nwith the Austrians crossed the Rhine to the south at Basel and Neu\r\nBreisach; Bernadotte in the Netherlands was welding Swedes, Dutch, and\r\nPrussians into a northern army. Meanwhile, the great defeat which\r\nWellington with his allied army of British, Spaniards, and Portuguese,\r\nhad inflicted upon the French at Vittoria (21 June, 1813) had for the\r\nlast time driven King Joseph from Madrid and in effect cleared the\r\nwhole Iberian peninsula of Napoleon's soldiers. The British general had\r\nthen gradually fought his way through the Pyrenees so that in the\r\nspring of 1814 a fourth victorious allied army in the neighborhood of\r\nToulouse threatened Napoleon from the south. An Austrian army, which\r\nwas then operating in Venetia and Lombardy, menaced France from yet a\r\nfifth direction.\r\n\r\nAgainst such overwhelming odds, Napoleon displayed throughout the\r\ndesperate months of February and March, 1814, the same remarkable\r\ngenius, the same indomitable will, as had characterized his earliest\r\ncampaigns. If anything, his resourcefulness and his rapidity of attack\r\nwere even greater. Inflicting a setback on one invader, he would turn\r\nquickly and dash against a second. Such apprehension did his tiger-like\r\nassaults excite among his opponents that as late as February he might\r\nhave retained the French frontiers of 1792 if he had chosen to make\r\npeace. He would play the game to the bitter end. On 1 March, the four\r\nGreat Powers--Great Britain, Russia, Austria, and Prussia--concluded\r\nthe treaty of Chaumont, definitely cementing their alliance for a\r\nperiod of twenty years and mutually agreeing not to make terms without\r\neach other's consent nor to desist from war until their arch-enemy had\r\nbeen overthrown: each contracting party undertook to furnish 150,000\r\nmen, and Great Britain further promised a subsidy of five million\r\npounds. The fate of Napoleon was at last settled.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Surrender of Paris and Abdication of Napoleon]\r\n\r\nTo describe in any detail the brilliant campaign of 1814 lies outside\r\nour province. Suffice it to state that, after the most stubborn\r\nfighting, resistance was broken. Paris surrendered to the allies on 31\r\nMarch, and thirteen days later Napoleon signed with the allied\r\nsovereigns the personal treaty of Fontainebleau, by which he abdicated\r\nhis throne and renounced all rights to France for himself and his\r\nfamily, and, in return, was guaranteed full sovereignty of the island\r\nof Elba and an annual pension of two million francs for himself; the\r\nItalian duchy of Parma was conferred upon the Empress Maria Louisa, and\r\npensions of two and a half million francs were promised for members of\r\nhis family. Another seven days and Napoleon bade his Old Guard an\r\naffecting farewell and departed for Elba. In his diminutive island\r\nempire, hard by the shore of Tuscany and within sight of his native\r\nCorsica, Napoleon Bonaparte lived ten months, introducing such vigor\r\ninto the administration as the island had never experienced and all the\r\nwhile pondering many things.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Restoration of the Bourbons in France]\r\n[Sidenote: Compromise with the Revolutionary Ideas]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in France order was emerging from chaos. In 1793 European\r\nsovereigns had banded together to invade France, to restore the divine-\r\nright monarchy of the Bourbons and the traditional rights of the\r\nprivileged classes, and to stamp out the embryonic principles of\r\nliberty, equality, and fraternity. The most noteworthy significance of\r\nthe Era of Napoleon was the simple fact that now in 1814 the monarchs\r\nof Europe, at last in possession of France, had no serious thought of\r\nrestoring social or political conditions just as they had been prior to\r\nthe Revolution. Their major quarrel was not with principles but with a\r\nman. The Tsar Alexander, to whom more than to any other one person, was\r\ndue the triumph of the allies, was a benevolent prince, well-versed in\r\nthe revolutionary philosophy, considerate of popular wishes, and\r\nanxious to promote a lasting peace. Talleyrand, the man of the hour\r\namong Frenchmen, who himself had played no mean rôle throughout the\r\nRevolution and under Napoleon, combined with a desire to preserve the\r\nfrontiers of his country a firm conviction that the bulk of his\r\ncountrymen would not revert to absolute monarchy. Between Talleyrand\r\nand Alexander it was arranged, with the approval of the Great Powers,\r\nthat in the name of \"legitimacy\" the Bourbons should be restored to the\r\nthrone of France, but with the understanding that they should fully\r\nrecognize and confirm the chief social and political reforms of the\r\nRevolution. It was likewise arranged by the treaty of Paris (30 May,\r\n1814), also in the name of \"legitimacy,\" that France should regain the\r\nlimits of 1792, should recover practically all the colonies which Great\r\nBritain had seized during the course of the Napoleonic wars, [Footnote:\r\nGreat Britain kept Tobago and St. Lucia in the West Indies, and\r\nMauritius (Île de France) on the route to India.] and should pay no\r\nindemnity. \"Legitimacy\" was a brilliant discovery of Talleyrand: it\r\njustified the preservation of France in the face of crushing defeat,\r\nand, if it restored the Bourbons, it did so as limited, not as\r\nabsolute, monarchs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louis XVIII]\r\n\r\nLouis XVI's \"legitimate\" heir was his brother, the count of Provence, a\r\ncynical, prosaic, and very stout old gentleman who had been quietly\r\nresiding in an English country-house, and who now made a solemn, if\r\nsomewhat unimpressive, state entry into Paris. The new king kept what\r\nforms of the old régime he could: he assumed the title of Louis XVIII,\r\n\"king of France by the grace of God\"; he reckoned his reign from the\r\ndeath of the dauphin (\"Louis XVII\") in the year 1795; he replaced the\r\nrevolutionary tricolor by the white and lilies of his family; out of\r\nthe fullness of his divinely bestowed royal authority he granted a\r\ncharter to the French people. But Louis XVIII was neither so foolish\r\nnor so principled as to insist upon the substance of Bourbon autocracy:\r\nthe very Constitutional Charter, which he so graciously promulgated,\r\nconfirmed the Revolutionary liberties of the individual and established\r\na fairly liberal form of government for France. It was obvious that the\r\ngouty old man had no desire to risk his head or to embark again upon\r\nhis travels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Monarchical Restorations Elsewhere in Europe]\r\n\r\nThe same month that witnessed the unbecoming straddle of this French\r\nBourbon between revolution and reaction, beheld the restoration of\r\nanother Bourbon in the person of Ferdinand VII to the throne of Spain,\r\nand the return of Pope Pius VII, amid the enthusiastic shouts of the\r\nRomans, to the ancient see upon the Tiber. About the same time Piedmont\r\nand Savoy were restored to Victor Emmanuel I, king of Sardinia. Europe\r\nwas rapidly assuming a more normal appearance. To settle the\r\noutstanding territorial questions which the overthrow of Napoleon had\r\nraised, a great congress of rulers and diplomats met at Vienna in the\r\nautumn of 1814.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Napoleon at Elba, 1814-1815]\r\n\r\nWithin a few months the unusual calm was rudely broken by the sudden\r\nreappearance of Napoleon Bonaparte himself upon the European stage. It\r\nwas hardly to be expected that he for whom the whole Continent had been\r\ntoo small would be contented in tiny Elba. He nursed grievances, too.\r\nHe could get no payment of the revenue secured him by the treaty of\r\nFontainebleau; his letters to his wife and little son were intercepted\r\nand unanswered; he was treated as an outcast. He became aware of a\r\nsituation both in France and at Vienna highly favorable to his own\r\nambition. As he foresaw, the shrinkage of the great empire into the\r\nrealm of old France filled many patriotic Frenchmen with disgust, a\r\nfeeling fed every day by stories of the presumption of returning\r\némigrés and of the tactless way in which the Bourbon princes treated\r\nveterans of the _Grande Armée_. Napoleon in time felt certain that\r\nhe could count once more upon the loyalty of the French nation. That he\r\nwould not be obliged to encounter again the combined forces of the\r\nEuropean Powers he inferred from his knowledge of the ever-recurring\r\njealousies among them and from the fact that even then Russia and\r\nPrussia on one side were quarreling with Austria and Great Britain on\r\nthe other over the fate of Saxony and Poland. If some fighting were\r\nnecessary, the return of French prisoners from Russia, Germany, Great\r\nBritain, and Spain would supply him with an army far larger than that\r\nwith which he had fought the brilliant campaign of 1814.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Episode of Napoleon's Return to France: \"The Hundred\r\nDays,\" March-June, 1815]\r\n\r\nOn 26 February, 1815, Napoleon slipped away from Elba with some twelve\r\nhundred men, and, managing to elude the British guardships, disembarked\r\nat Cannes on 1 March and advanced northward. Troops sent out to arrest\r\nthe arch-rebel were no proof against the familiar uniform and cocked\r\nhat: they threw their own hats in the air amid ringing shouts of\r\n_vive l'empereur_. Everywhere the adventurer received a hearty\r\nwelcome, which attested at once the unpopularity of the Bourbons and\r\nthe singular attractiveness of his own personality. The French people,\r\nbeing but human, put imagination in the place of reason. Without firing\r\na shot in his defense, Napoleon's bodyguard swelled until it became an\r\narmy. Marshal Ney, the \"bravest of the brave,\" who had taken the oath\r\nof allegiance to the Bourbons and had promised Louis XVIII that he\r\nwould bring Napoleon to Paris in an iron cage, deserted to him with\r\n6000 men, and on 20 March the emperor jauntily entered the capital.\r\nLouis XVIII himself, who had assured his parliament that he would die\r\nin defense of his throne, was already in precipitate flight toward the\r\nBelgian frontier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Napoleon and France]\r\n\r\nNapoleon clinched his hold upon the French people by means of an astute\r\nmanifesto which he promptly published. \"He had come,\" he declared, \"to\r\nsave France from the outrages of the returning nobles; to secure to the\r\npeasant the possession of his land; to uphold the rights won in 1789\r\nagainst a minority which sought to reëstablish the privileges of caste\r\nand the feudal burdens of the last century; France had made trial of\r\nthe Bourbons; it had done well to do so, but the experiment had failed;\r\nthe Bourbon monarchy had proved incapable of detaching itself from its\r\nworst supports, the priests and nobles; only the dynasty which owed its\r\nthrone to the Revolution could maintain the social work of the\r\nRevolution. ... He renounced war and conquest ... he would govern\r\nhenceforth as a constitutional sovereign and seek to bequeath a\r\nconstitutional crown to his son.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Napoleon and Europe]\r\n\r\nThe emperor was as wrong in his judgment of what Europe would do as he\r\nwas right concerning the attitude of France. The statesmen who had been\r\nhaggling about treaty stipulations at Vienna speedily forgot all their\r\ndifferences in the face of common danger. The four Great Powers\r\nsolemnly renewed their treaty of alliance, and with alacrity and\r\nunanimity all joined in signing a declaration. \"In violating the\r\nconvention which established him in the island of Elba, Bonaparte has\r\ndestroyed the only legal title to his existence. By reappearing in\r\nFrance with projects of disorder and destruction, he has cut himself\r\noff from the protection of the law, and has shown in the face of all\r\nthe world that there can be neither peace nor truce with him.\r\nAccordingly the Powers declare that Napoleon Bonaparte is excluded from\r\ncivil and social relations, and as an enemy and disturber of the\r\ntranquillity of the world he has incurred public vengeance....\"\r\n\r\nIn order to give force to their threats, the allies rushed troops\r\ntoward France. Wellington assembled an army of more than 100,000\r\nBritish, Dutch, and Germans, and planned to coöperate with 120,000\r\nPrussians under Blücher near Brussels. The Austrian army under\r\nSchwarzenberg neared the Rhine. Russia and Germany were alive with\r\nmarching columns. To oppose these forces Napoleon raised an army of\r\n200,000 men, and on 12 June, 1815, quitted Paris for the Belgian\r\nfrontier. His plan was to separate his opponents and to overcome them\r\nsingly: it would be a repetition of the campaign of 1814, though on a\r\nlarger scale.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Waterloo]\r\n\r\nHow Napoleon passed the border and forced the outposts of the enemy\r\nback to Waterloo; how there, on 18 June, he fought the final great\r\nbattle of his remarkable career; how his troops were mowed down by the\r\nfearful fire of his adversaries and how even his famous Old Guard\r\nrallied gloriously but ineffectually to their last charge; how the\r\ndefeat administered by Wellington was turned at the close of the day\r\ninto a mad rout through the arrival of Blücher's forces: all these\r\nmatters are commonplaces in the most elementary histories of military\r\nscience. It has long been customary to cite the battle of Waterloo as\r\none of the world's decisive battles. In a sense this is just, but it\r\nshould be borne in mind that, in view of the firm united determination\r\nof all Europe, there was no ultimate chance for Napoleon. If he had\r\ndefeated Wellington, he would still have had to deal with Blücher. If\r\nhe should then defeat the Prussians, he would have to turn suddenly\r\nagainst Schwarzenberg and the Austrians. By that time Wellington would\r\nhave been sufficiently reënforced to resume the offensive, and the war\r\nwould have gone on inevitably to but a single grim conclusion. The\r\nallies could put almost limitless numbers in the field; Napoleon was at\r\nthe end of his resources. For the conservation of human life, it was\r\nfortunate that Napoleon was overwhelmed at Waterloo and that the first\r\nbattle of the campaign of 1815 was also its last. Waterloo added\r\nmilitary prestige to the naval preëminence which Great Britain already\r\nenjoyed, and finally established the reputation of Wellington as the\r\ngreatest general of his age next only to Napoleon himself. It is small\r\nwonder that the English have magnified and glorified Waterloo.\r\n[Footnote: An interesting side issue of the Waterloo campaign was the\r\nfate of Joachim Murat. The wily king of Naples, distrustful of the\r\nallies' guarantees, threw in his lot with his brother-in-law. His\r\nforces were speedily put to rout by the Austrians and he himself fled\r\nto France and later to Corsica, and was ultimately captured and shot.\r\nHis action enabled still another Bourbon, the despicable Ferdinand I,\r\nto recover his throne.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Final Overthrow of Napoleon ]\r\n\r\nOn 21 June, Napoleon arrived in Paris, defeated and dejected. That very\r\nday the parliament, on the motion of Lafayette, declared itself in\r\npermanent session and took over all functions of government. The\r\nfollowing day Napoleon abdicated the second time in favor of his son,\r\nand the provisional government of France, under the skillful trimming\r\nof the clever Fouché, reopened negotiations with the Bourbons. On 7\r\nJuly the allies reoccupied Paris, bringing the flustered old Louis\r\nXVIII \"in their baggage-train.\" The Bourbons, thus unheroically\r\nrestored, were destined for fifteen years to maintain in peace their\r\ncompromise between revolution and reaction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Napoleon at St. Helena 1815-1821 ]\r\n\r\nOn 15 July, the day following the anniversary of the fall of the\r\nBastille, Napoleon, who had gone to Rochefort on the French coast, with\r\nsome vague idea of taking refuge in America, delivered himself over to\r\nthe commander of a British warship which was lying in the harbor. For\r\nus who live a century after the stirring events whose narrative has\r\nfilled this chapter, it is easy to perceive that the British government\r\nmight safely have extended hospitality to their famous captive and\r\nmight have granted him an asylum in England. He was finally discredited\r\nin the eyes not only of the European despots but also of the vast\r\nmajority of the French people; no matter how much he might burn with\r\nthe flame of his old ambition, he could never again be in a position to\r\nendanger the safety or prosperity of the United Kingdom. But in 1815\r\nEnglishmen felt differently, and naturally so. To them Napoleon had\r\nbeen for years a more troublesome and dangerous enemy than a Philip II\r\nor a Louis XIV. By them he was deemed the unregenerate child of\r\ndarkness and of the evil spirit. And \"General Bonaparte,\" as the\r\nBritish authorities persisted in calling him, was not suffered to touch\r\nfoot upon the sacred soil of England, but was dispatched on another\r\nBritish warship to the rocky island of St. Helena in the south\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nOn St. Helena Napoleon lived five and a half years. He was allowed\r\nconsiderable freedom of movement and the society of a group of close\r\npersonal friends. He spent his time in walking on the lonely island or\r\nin quarreling with his suspicious strait-laced English jailer, Sir\r\nHudson Lowe, or in writing treatises on history and war and dictating\r\nmemoirs to his companions. These memoirs, which were subsequently\r\npublished by the Marquis de Las Cases, were subtly compounded of truth\r\nand falsehood. They represented Napoleon Bonaparte in the light of a\r\ntrue son and heir of the Revolution, who had been raised by the will of\r\nthe French people to great power in order that he might consolidate the\r\nglorious achievements of liberty, equality, and fraternity. According\r\nto the emperor himself, he had always been the friend of peace and of\r\noppressed nationalities, the author of blessings which had flowed\r\nuninterruptedly upon his people until he had been thwarted by the\r\nmachinations of the British and the sheer brute force of the European\r\ndespots. Napoleon shrewdly foresaw the increase of popular discontent\r\nwith the repressive measures which the reactionary sovereigns and\r\nstatesmen of Europe were bound to inaugurate, and in the resulting\r\nupheaval he thought he could see an opportunity for his beloved son to\r\nbuild anew an empire of the French. It could hardly have been blind\r\nchance that caused him to insert in his will the pious request that he\r\n\"be buried on the banks of the Seine in the midst of the French people\r\nwhom he so dearly loved.\" On 5 May, 1821, the greatest adventurer of\r\nmodern times died on the island of St. Helena.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Napoleonic Legend]\r\n\r\nAlready the history of the emperor was becoming the Napoleonic Legend.\r\nThe more his memory was revered as the noble martyr of St. Helena, the\r\nmore truth withdrew into the background and fiction stepped into the\r\nlimelight. His holocausts of human life were forgotten; only the glory,\r\nthe unconquerable prowess of his arms, was remembered. French cottages\r\nwere adorned with cheap likenesses of the little corporal's features;\r\nquaint, endearing nicknames for their hero were on villagers' lips; and\r\naround hearth and campfire were related apocryphal anecdotes of his\r\nexploits at Lodi, at Austerlitz, and at Wagram. From a selfish despot\r\nNapoleon was returning to his mightier, if humbler, position as a child\r\nof the people. Thus the last years at St. Helena were far from\r\nfruitless: they proved once more that the pen is mightier than the\r\nsword,--for one day, not by feats of arms, but by the power of the\r\nNapoleonic Legend, another Bonaparte was to be seated upon the throne\r\nof France.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THE ERA OF NAPOLEON\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Continuation of the Revolutionary Era]\r\n[Sidenote: Liberty under Napoleon]\r\n\r\nIf we turn now from the story of Napoleon's life to an attempt to\r\nappraise the significance of the whole era which fittingly bears his\r\nname, we are struck by its manifold achievements in politics and\r\nsociety, in commerce, and in war. In general it was a continuation of\r\nthe French the Revolution. The principles of liberty, equality, and\r\nfraternity, which, from 1789 to 1799, had been laid down as the\r\nfoundation exclusively of French political and social institutions,\r\nbecame, from 1799 to 1815, the building-blocks for all European\r\nnations. The least understood and used was undoubtedly liberty. To be\r\nsure, both the Consulate and the empire were concrete and substantial\r\nexamples of the replacement of the old theory of divine-right monarchy\r\nby the new idea of popular sovereignty, of governments resting, in last\r\nanalysis, upon the consent of the governed. But Napoleon did hardly\r\nmore to vitalize individual liberties than did the benevolent despots\r\nof the eighteenth century, or those of his own day. To secure the\r\ninterested support of the bourgeoisie and the peasantry, the sacred\r\nright of private property was eloquently reaffirmed, and, as a trusty\r\nweapon against possible clerical pretensions, the noble rights of\r\nliberty of conscience and liberty of worship were grandiloquently\r\npreached; but the less serviceable liberties of speech and of\r\npublication were confined within the narrowest limits of military and\r\nimperial toleration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Equality\" under Napoleon]\r\n\r\nWith equality it was quite different. In all the lands annexed to\r\nFrance or included within the radius of Napoleon's direct influence,\r\nthe forms and rights of feudalism and serfdom were abolished, and the\r\nsocial equalities embodied _Code Napoléon_ were guaranteed.\r\nThroughout southern Germany, the Netherlands, the Iberian peninsula,\r\nand a great part of Italy, as well as in France, the social aspects of\r\nthe old régime underwent a thorough transformation; interior customs\r\nlines, private roadways, toll-bridges, and internal trade restrictions\r\nwere swept away; in the place of large landed estates, with their old-\r\ntime noble owners and their wretched peasants attached to the soil and\r\nsuffering from burdensome tithes and dues and personal services,\r\nappeared a numerous class of peasant proprietors, owning and tilling\r\ntheir own fields, free to buy, sell, or exchange them, or to move away\r\nto the growing towns. Outside of Napoleon's direct influence, the land\r\nreforms of Baron vom Stein in Prussia reflected the same spirit of the\r\nage. These social gains in the direction of equality were, in fact, the\r\nmost permanent achievements of the Napoleonic Era: in spite of later\r\nreaction, it was beyond the reach of possibility to restore the\r\ninequalities of the outworn feudal system.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Fraternity\" under Napoleon]\r\n[Sidenote: The Emphasis on Nationalism]\r\n\r\nFraternity, or national patriotism, received a marked impetus during\r\nthe era. Communicated from France by the ardor of the revolutionary and\r\nNapoleonic soldiers, it evoked ready response not only in Poland,\r\nHolland, Portugal, Spain, England, and Russia, in which countries it\r\nwas already existent, but also in the Germanies and in the Italian\r\nstates, where centuries of petty strife and jealousy seemed to have\r\nblotted it out forever. The significance of the Napoleonic period in\r\nthe history of Germany is incalculable. The diminution of the number of\r\nstates, the abolition of the effete Holy Roman Empire, the regeneration\r\nof Prussia, the War of Liberation, the Battle of the Nations, the\r\nconsciousness of common interests, and the wave of patriotism which\r\nswept over the whole German folk, presaged before the lapse of many\r\ndecades the political unification of the Germanies and the erection of\r\na powerful national state. Nor were the Italians devoid of a similar\r\nnational feeling. The fame of Napoleon, a man of Italian blood, the\r\ntemporary establishment of a \"kingdom of Italy,\" the title of \"king of\r\nRome\" conferred upon the infant heir to Napoleon's fortunes, the social\r\nreforms and the patriotic awakening throughout the peninsula,--all\r\nbetokened a national destiny for the whole Italian people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minor Political Happenings]\r\n\r\nIn minor political ways the Napoleonic Era was not without\r\nsignificance. The Tsar was enabled finally to acquire Finland, Poland,\r\nand Turkish land as far as the River Pruth, Minor thus completing the\r\nwork of Peter the Great and Catherine the Great, and rounding out the\r\nEuropean frontier of Russia to its present extent. Sweden secured\r\nNorway and a new dynasty, which, descended from Marshal Bernadotte, the\r\ninteresting son of an obscure French lawyer, has reigned ever since. In\r\nthe case of Portugal, the flight of the royal family to Brazil in 1807\r\nhad the curious effect of causing them for several years to hold their\r\ncourt in their principal colony and to govern the mother-country\r\nthrough regents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Remarkable Significance of the Era to Great Britain]\r\n[Sidenote: Colonies]\r\n[Sidenote: Commerce]\r\n\r\nBeyond continental Europe the period was of utmost importance. The\r\nmaritime and commercial supremacy of Great Britain, which had been\r\nseriously shaken by the War of American Independence, was regained in\r\nthe course of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars. Of course the\r\nUnited States continued independent. But the great victories of Lord\r\nNelson over the French fleets rendered Great Britain the true mistress\r\nof the seas; and she proceeded to utilize her naval superiority to\r\nappropriate what remaining French colonies most suited her purpose. In\r\nthis way she possessed herself of Malta (1800), St. Lucia, Tobago\r\n(1803), and Mauritius (1810). Then, too, the dependence of Holland upon\r\nFrance, involuntary though it was most of the time, afforded her an\r\nopportunity to seize such valuable Dutch colonies as Ceylon (1795),\r\nGuiana (1803), and South Africa (1806). The sorry subservience of the\r\nSpanish Bourbons to Napoleon gave Great Britain a similar chance to\r\nprey upon Spanish commerce, to occupy some Spanish colonies, and to\r\nopen others to her own trade: at this time the British took possession\r\nof Trinidad (1797) and Honduras (1798) and sent raiding expeditions\r\nagainst Buenos Aires and Montevideo (1806-1807). The subsequent\r\nPeninsular War, in which, as we have seen, the British coöperated with\r\nthe Spaniards in maintaining the latter's freedom against Napoleon, put\r\nan end to the hostile British incursions into the Spanish colonies, but\r\nit worked in another way to Great Britain's advantage. The Spanish\r\ncolonies--Mexico, Central America, and the greater part of South\r\nAmerica--were thrown into grave administrative perplexities by the\r\nconflict of authority between the two Bourbon kings, Charles IV and\r\nFerdinand VII, and between King Joseph Bonaparte and the revolutionary\r\n_juntas_; the colonists gradually got into the habit of managing\r\ntheir own affairs and of opening their ports to British trade; and the\r\nresult was that by 1814, when Ferdinand was at length firmly\r\nestablished upon the Spanish throne, he was confronted by colonists,\r\nthe greater number of whom had all along professed allegiance to him,\r\nbut who now, accustomed to the advantages of free trade and practical\r\nindependence, were resolved to maintain them. The disruption of the\r\nSpanish colonial empire was a direct outcome of Napoleon's career, and\r\nnext to the colonists themselves the British were the chief\r\nbeneficiaries. In general, the new colonies which Great Britain\r\nacquired were intended either, as in the case of Malta, Mauritius,\r\nCeylon, and South Africa, to strengthen her hold upon India, or, as in\r\nthe case of the others, to develop her trade with Spanish America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Industry]\r\n\r\nThis naval predominance of Great Britain and the expansion of her\r\ncommerce and colonial empire synchronized with the rapid development of\r\nthe Industrial Revolution within England. It was the ceaseless\r\noperation of spinning frames and power looms, of blast furnaces and\r\nsteam engines, in a country on which the French emperor's army had\r\nnever trod, that most truly worked the downfall of Napoleon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BONAPARTE FAMILY]\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL READING\r\n\r\n\r\nTEXTBOOK NARRATIVES.
