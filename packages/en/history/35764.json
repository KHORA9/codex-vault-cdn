XCV of the\r\nHakluyt Society's publications). Here we have again to acknowledge the\r\nkind advice and help of various friends, particularly of Senhor Batalhaȧ\r\nReis and Mr. William Foster. As to the Maps which accompany this volume:\r\nthe sections of Andrea Bianco, 1448, and of Fra Mauro, 1457-9, here\r\ngiven, offer some of the best examples of the cartography of Prince\r\nHenry's later years in relation to West Africa. These ancient examples\r\nare supplemented by a new sketch-map of the discoveries made by the\r\nPortuguese seamen during the Infant's lifetime along the coast of the\r\nDark Continent. The excellent photograph of Prince Henry's statue from\r\nthe great gateway at Belem is the work of Senhor Camacho. As to the\r\nIntroduction and Notes, it is hoped that attention has been given to\r\neverything really important for the understanding of Azurara's text; but\r\nthe Editors have avoided such treatment as belongs properly to a\r\ndetailed history of geographical advance during this period.\r\n\r\n\r\n          C. R. B.\r\n          E. P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 1899._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this it may be well to summarise briefly, for the better illustration\r\nof the _Chronicle_ here translated, not only the life of Prince Henry of\r\nPortugal, surnamed the Navigator, but also various questions suggested\r\nby Prince Henry's work, _e.g._--The history of the Voyages along the\r\nWest African coast and among the Atlantic islands, encouraged by him and\r\nrecorded by Azurara; The History of the other voyages of Prince Henry's\r\ncaptains, not recorded by Azurara; The attempts of navigators before\r\nPrince Henry, especially in the fourteenth century, to find a way along\r\nWest Africa to the Indies; The parallel enterprises by land from the\r\nBarbary States to the Sudan, across the Sahara; The comparative strength\r\nof Islam and Christianity in the Africa of Prince Henry's time; The\r\nState of Cartographical Knowledge in the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies, and its relation to the new Portuguese discoveries; The\r\nquestion of the \"School of Sagres,\" said to have been instituted by the\r\nNavigator for the better training of mariners and map-makers.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--THE LIFE OF PRINCE HENRY.\r\n\r\nHenry, Duke of Viseu, third[1] son of King John I of Portugal, surnamed\r\nthe Great, founder of the House of Aviz, and of Philippa of Lancaster,\r\ndaughter of John of Gaunt and niece of King Edward III of England, was\r\nborn on March 4th, 1394.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Fifth, counting two children who died in infancy.]\r\n\r\nWe are told by Diego Gomez,[2] who in 1458 sailed to the West Coast of\r\nAfrica in the service of Prince Henry, and made a discovery of the Cape\r\nVerde islands, that in 1415 John de Trasto was sent by the Prince on a\r\nvoyage of exploration, and reached \"Telli,\" the \"fruitful\" district of\r\nGrand Canary. Gomez here gives us the earliest date assigned by any\r\nauthority of the fifteenth century for an expedition of the Infant's;\r\nbut in later times other statements were put forward, assigning 1412 or\r\neven 1410 as the commencement of his exploring activity. This would take\r\nus back to a time when the Prince was but sixteen or eighteen years old;\r\nand though it is probable enough that Portuguese vessels may have sailed\r\nout at this time (as in 1341) to the Canaries or along the West African\r\ncoast, it is not probable that Henry took any great share in such\r\nenterprise before the Ceuta expedition of 1415. In any case, it is\r\npractically certain that before 1434, no Portuguese ship had passed\r\nbeyond Cape Bojador. Gil Eannes' achievement of that year is marked by\r\nAzurara and all our best authorities as a decided advance on any\r\nprevious voyage, at least of Portuguese mariners. We shall consider\r\npresently how far this advance was anticipated by other nations, and\r\nmore particularly by the French. Cape Non, now claimed by some as the\r\nsouthernmost point of Marocco, had been certainly passed by Catalan and\r\nother ships[3] before Prince Henry's day; but it had not been forgotten\r\nhow rhyme and legend had long consecrated this point as a fated end of\r\nthe world. Probably it was still (c. 1415) believed by many in\r\nPortugal--\r\n\r\n    \"Quem passar o Cabo de Não\r\n     Ou tornará, ou não.\"\r\n\r\nand the Venetian explorer, Cadamosto, preserves a mention of its popular\r\nderivation in Southern Europe from the Latin \"Non,\" \"as beyond it was\r\nbelieved there was no return possible.\" The real form was probably the\r\nArabic Nun or \"Fish.\"[4]\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 2: As repeated by Martin Behaim (see Major, _Henry\r\n   Navigator_, pp. 64, 65). Gomez was Almoxarife, or\r\n   superintendent, of the Palace of Cintra.]\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 3: Some of which had reached at least as far as Cape\r\n   Bojador, as depicted on the Catalan Map of 1375.]\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 4: So Zul-nun, Lord of the Fish, is a term for the\r\n   prophet Jonah (see Burton, _Camoëns_, iii, p. 246).]\r\n\r\nPrince Henry's active share in the work of exploration is usually dated\r\nonly from the Conquest of Ceuta. Here we are told in one of our earliest\r\nauthorities (Diego Gomez) he gained information, from Moorish prisoners,\r\nmerchants, and other acquaintance \"of the passage of traders from the\r\ncoasts of Tunis to Timbuktu and to Cantor on the Gambia, which led him\r\nto seek those lands by the way of the sea;\" and, to come to details, he\r\nwas among other things, \"told of certain tall palms growing at the mouth\r\nof the Senegal [or Western Nile], by which he was able to guide the\r\ncaravels he sent out to find that river.\" It will be important hereafter\r\nto examine the evidence which had been accumulated for such belief up to\r\nthe fifteenth century: now it will be enough to say: 1. That Prince\r\nHenry was probably of the same opinion as the ordinary cartographer of\r\nhis time about the peninsular shape of Africa. 2. That the \"shape\" in\r\nquestion was usually satisfied with what we should now call the Northern\r\nhalf of the Continent, making the Southern coast of \"Guinea\" continue\r\ndirectly to the Eastern, Abyssinian, or Indian Ocean. 3. That trade had\r\nnow (c. 1415) been long maintained between this \"Guinea coast\" and the\r\nMediterranean seaboard--chiefly by Moorish caravans across the Sahara.\r\n4. That something, though little, was known in Western Christendom about\r\nthe Christian faith and king of Abyssinia; for \"Prester John's\" story in\r\nthe fifteenth century had really become a blend of rumours from Central\r\n(Nestorian) Asia and Eastern (Abyssinian) Africa.\r\n\r\nIn Prince Henry's work we may distinguish three main\r\nobjects--scientific, patriotic, and religious. First of all he was a\r\ndiscoverer, for the sake of the new knowledge then beginning. He was\r\ninterested in the exploration of the world in general, and of the\r\nsea-route round Africa to India in particular. Dinis Diaz, returning\r\nfrom his discovery of Cape Verde (Az., ch. xxxi.), brought home a \"booty\r\nnot so great as had arrived in the past,\" but \"the Infant thought it\r\nvery great indeed, since it came from that land\", and he proportioned\r\nhis rewards to exploration rather than to trade profits. Nuno Tristam in\r\n1441 (Az., ch. xiii.) reminds Antam Gonçalvez that \"for 15 years\" the\r\nInfant has \"striven ... to arrive at ... certainty as to the people of\r\nthis land, under what law or lordship they do live.\"\r\n\r\nAzurara, though always more prone to emphasize the emotional than the\r\nscientific, himself assigns as the first reason for the Infant's\r\ndiscoveries, his \"wish to know the land that lay beyond the isles of\r\nCanary and that cape called Bojador, for that up to his time, neither by\r\nwritings nor by the memory of man, was known with any certainty the\r\nnature of the land\" (Az., ch. vii.).\r\n\r\nAgain, Henry was founding upon his work of exploration an over-sea\r\ndominion, a \"commercial and colonial\" empire for his country. He desired\r\nto see her rich and prosperous, and there cannot be any reasonable doubt\r\nthat his ideas agreed with those of Italian land and sea travellers in\r\nthe thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. He and they were agreed in\r\nthinking it possible and very important to secure a large share of\r\nAsiatic, especially of Indian, trade for their respective countries. By\r\nexploring and making practicable the maritime route around Africa to the\r\nIndies, he would probably raise Portugal into the wealthiest of European\r\nnations. Azurara's \"second reason\" for the \"search after Guinea\" is that\r\n\"many kinds of merchandise might be brought to this realm ... and also\r\nthe products of this realm might be taken there, which traffic would\r\nbring great profit to our countrymen.\"\r\n\r\nThirdly, Prince Henry had the temperament of a Crusader and a\r\nmissionary. Of him, fully as much as of Columbus, it may be said that if\r\nhe aimed at empire, it was for the extension of Christendom. Azurara's\r\nthree final reasons for Henry's explorations all turn upon this. The\r\nPrince desired to find out the full strength of the Moors in Africa,\r\n\"said to be very much greater than commonly supposed,\" \"because every\r\nwise man\" desires \"a knowledge of the power of his enemy.\" He also\r\n\"sought to know if there were in those parts any Christian princes\" who\r\nwould aid him against the enemies of the faith. And, lastly, he desired\r\nto \"make increase in the faith of Jesus Christ, and to bring to Him all\r\nthe souls that should be saved.\"\r\n\r\nIt has often been pointed out how the Infant was aided in his work by\r\nthe tendencies of his time and country; how in him the spirit of\r\nmediæval faith and the spirit of material, even of commercial, ambition,\r\nwere united; how he was the central representative of a general\r\nexpansive and exploring movement; and how he took up and carried on the\r\nlabours of various predecessors. At the same time it must be recognised\r\nthat his work forms an epoch in the history of geographical, commercial,\r\nand colonial advance; that he gave a permanence and a vitality to the\r\ncause of maritime discovery which it had never possessed before; that\r\neven his rediscoveries of islands and mainland frequently had all the\r\nmeaning and importance of fresh achievements; that he made his nation\r\nthe pioneer of Europe in its conquest of the outer world; and that\r\nwithout him the results of the great forty years (1480-1520) of Diaz,\r\nColumbus, Da Gama, and Magellan must have been long, might have been\r\nindefinitely, postponed.\r\n\r\nBarros (_Decade I_, i, 2) tells us a story, probable enough, about the\r\ninception of the Infant's plans of discovery. He relates how one night,\r\nafter much meditation, he lay sleepless upon his bed, thinking over his\r\nschemes, till at last, as if seized with a sudden access of fury, he\r\nleapt up, called his servants, and ordered some of his _barcas_ to be\r\nimmediately made ready for a voyage to the south along the coast of\r\nMarocco. His court was astonished, and attributed this outburst to a\r\ndivine revelation. It was natural enough--the resolution of a man, weary\r\nwith profound and anxious thought, to take some sort of decisive action,\r\nto embark without further delay on the realisation of long-cherished\r\nschemes.\r\n\r\nTo summarise the course of the Prince's life, from 1415, before entering\r\non any discussion of special points: After the Conquest of Ceuta he\r\nreturned to Portugal; was created Duke of Viseu and Lord of Covilham\r\n(1415), having already received his knighthood at \"Septa\"; and began to\r\nsend out regular exploring ventures down the West Coast of Africa--\"two\r\nor three ships\" every year beyond Cape Non, Nun, or Nam. In 1418 he\r\nsuccessfully went to the help of the Governor of Ceuta against the Moors\r\nof Marocco and Granada.[5] On this second return from Africa, when in\r\n1419 he was created Governor of the Algarve or southmost province of\r\nPortugal, he is supposed by some to have taken up his residence at\r\nSagres,[6] near Cape St. Vincent, and to have begun the establishment of\r\na school of cartography and navigation there. All this, however, is\r\ndisputed by others, as is the tradition of his having established Chairs\r\nof Mathematics and Theology at Lisbon.[7]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: On this occasion he planned, but did not attempt,\r\n    the seizure of Gibraltar.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: Sagres, from \"Sacrum Promontorium,\" the ordinary\r\n    name of Cape St. Vincent in the later classical Geography; \"à\r\n    91 Kilom. Ouest de Faro,... sur un cap, à 4,500 metres E.S.E.\r\n    du Cap St. Vincent\" (Viv. St. Martin). The harbour is sandy,\r\n    protected from the N.W. winds. A Druid temple stood there, and\r\n    the Iberians of the Roman time assembled there at night. It\r\n    was a barren cape, its only natural vegetation a few junipers.\r\n    O. Martins (_Filhos de D. João I_, p. 77), suggests that the\r\n    name of _Sagres_ did not come into ordinary use till after the\r\n    Prince's death, 1460.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: In 1431 he is said to have purchased house-room\r\n    for the University of Lisbon; on March 25th, 1448, to have\r\n    established there a professorship of theology; and on\r\n    September 22, 1460, to have confirmed this by a charter dated\r\n    from his Town at Sagres. The Professor was to have twelve\r\n    marks in silver every Christmas from the tithes of the Island\r\n    of Madeira (see Azurara, _Guinea_, c. v). As to the Chair of\r\n    Mathematics, we only know that it existed in 1435; that the\r\n    Infant was interested in this study; and that tradition\r\n    connected him with a somewhat similar foundation at Sagres.\r\n    The houses purchased in Lisbon for the University were bought\r\n    of João Annes, the King's Armourer, for 400 crowns. Hence,\r\n    according to some, came the Prince's title of \"Protector of\r\n    Portuguese Studies.\"]\r\n\r\nIn 1418-20, however, his captains, João Gonçalvez Zarco and Tristam Vaz\r\nTeixeira, certainly re-discovered Porto Santo and Madeira.[8] In 1427,\r\nKing John and Prince Henry seem to have sent the royal pilot, Diego de\r\nSevill, to make new discoveries in the Azores; and, in 1431-2, Gonçalo\r\nVelho Cabral made further explorations among the same; but the completer\r\nopening up and settlement of the Archipelago was the work of later\r\nyears, especially of 1439-66. We shall return to this matter in a\r\nspecial discussion of Prince Henry's work among the Atlantic islands. To\r\nthe same we must refer the traditional purchase of the Canaries in\r\n1424-5 and the settlement of Madeira in the same year,[9] confirmed by\r\ncharters of 1430 and 1433. King John, on his death-bed, is said to have\r\nexhorted Henry to persevere in his schemes, which he was at this very\r\ntime pursuing by means of a fresh expedition to round Cape Bojador,\r\nunder Gil Eannes (1433). Azurara from this point becomes our chief\r\nauthority down to the year 1448, and this and the subsequent voyages are\r\nfully described in his pages. Gil Eannes, unsuccessful in 1433,[10]\r\nunder the stimulus of the Infant's reproaches and appeals passed Cape\r\nBojador in 1434;[11] and next summer (1435) the Portuguese reached the\r\nAngra dos Ruyvos (Gurnet Bay), 150 miles beyond Bojador, and the Rio do\r\nOuro, 240 miles to the south. Early in 1436 the \"Port of Gallee,\" a\r\nlittle North of C. Branco (Blanco), was discovered by Baldaya, but as\r\nyet no natives were found; no captives, gold dust, or other products\r\nbrought home. Exploration along the African mainland languished from\r\nthis year till 1441;[12] but in 1437 the Prince took part in the fatal\r\nattack on Tangier, and in 1438 the death of King Edward caused a dispute\r\nover the question of the Regency during the minority of his young son\r\nAffonso. Throughout these internal troubles Henry played an important\r\npart, successfully supporting the claims of his brother Pedro against\r\nthe Queen-mother, Leonor of Aragon. All this caused a break of three or\r\nfour years in the progress of his discoveries; but the colonisation of\r\nthe Azores went forward, as is shown by the license of July 2, 1439,\r\nfrom Affonso V, to people \"the seven islands\" of the group, then known.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: O. Martins thinks these island discoveries were a\r\n    surprise to Henry, who at first only contemplated discovery\r\n    along the mainland coast South and East towards India. We do\r\n    not believe in this limitation of view (see Barros, _Dec. I_,\r\n    Lib. I, c. 2, 3).\r\n\r\n    The previous voyage of the Englishman Macham to the \"Isle of\r\n    Wood\" (\"Legname\" on the fourteenth-century Portolani) is\r\n    another controversial matter which must be taken separately.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: Zarco and Vaz became Captains Donatory or Feudal\r\n    Under-lords of Madeira, as Bartholemew Perestrello (whose\r\n    daughter Columbus married) of Porto Santo.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: It has been shewn, _e.g._, by the British\r\n    Admiralty Surveys, that the old stories of dangerous reefs and\r\n    currents at Bojador, \"such as might well have frightened the\r\n    boldest mariner of that time,\" are unfounded, like the old\r\n    belief in strong Satanic influence at this point.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 11: 1432, according to Galvano (see Barros, _I_, i,\r\n    4).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: Till 1440, according to the opposition\r\n    chronology of O. Martins.]\r\n\r\nIn 1441[13] exploration began again in earnest with the voyage of Antam\r\nGonçalvez, who brought to Portugal the first native\r\n\"specimens\"--captives and gold dust--from the coasts beyond Bojador;\r\nwhile Nuno Tristam in the same year pushed on to Cape Blanco. These\r\ndecisive successes greatly strengthened the cause of discovery in\r\nPortugal, especially by offering fresh hopes of mercantile profit. In\r\n1442 Nuno Tristam reached the Bight or Bay of Arguim,[14] where the\r\nInfant erected a fort in 1448, and where for some years the Portuguese\r\nmade their most vigorous and successful slave-raids. Private venturers\r\nnow began to come forward, supplementing Prince Henry's efforts by\r\nvolunteer aid, for which his permission[15] was readily granted.\r\nEspecially the merchants and seamen of Lisbon and of Lagos, close to\r\nSagres, showed interest in this direction. Whatever doubts exist as to\r\nthe earlier alleged settlement of the Infant at Cape St. Vincent, it is\r\ncertain that after his return from Tangier (1437) he erected various\r\nbuildings[16] at Sagres, and resided there during a considerable part of\r\nhis later life. This fact is to be connected with the new African\r\ndevelopments at Lagos.[17]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: O. Martins dates _Porto do Cavalleiro_, 1440;\r\n    _C. Branco_, 1442.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 14: _Aliter_, 1443 (Barros, _I_, i, 7) or 1444\r\n    (Galvano, who apparently dates the discovery of the Rio do\r\n    Ouro 1443). See, in this connection, Affonso V's Charters of\r\n    October 22, 1433, and February 3, 1446, granted to Prince\r\n    Henry. In 1442 the Infant was created a Knight of the Garter\r\n    of England. He was the 153rd Knight of the Order; and his\r\n    collar descended, through many holders, to the late Earl of\r\n    Clarendon.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: Necessary by decree of the Regent Pedro, for any\r\n    \"Guinea\" or African voyage (Azurara, _Guinea_, ch. xv).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: Especially a palace, a church or chapel, and an\r\n    observatory.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: Which seems to have shown the way, in this\r\n    respect, to its greater sister, Lisbon.]\r\n\r\nIn 1444 and 1445 a number of ships sailed with Henry's license to\r\n\"Guinea,\" and several of their commanders achieved notable successes.\r\nThus Dinis Diaz, Nuno Tristam, and others reached the Senegal. Diaz\r\nrounded Cape Verde in 1445,[18] and in 1446 Alvaro Fernandez sailed on\r\nas far as the River Gambia (?) and the Cape of Masts (Cabo dos Mastos).\r\nIn 1445, also, João Fernandez spent seven months among the natives of\r\nthe Arguim coast, and brought back the first trustworthy account of a\r\npart of the interior. Gonçalo de Sintra and Gonçalo Pacheco, in 1445,\r\nand Nuno Tristam in 1446,[19] fell victims to the hostility of the Moors\r\nand Negroes, who, perhaps, felt some natural resentment against their\r\nnew visitors. For, in Azurara's estimate, the Portuguese up to the year\r\n1446 had carried off 927 captives from these parts; and the disposition\r\nand conversion of these prisoners occupied a good portion of the\r\nInfant's time. He probably relied on finding efficient material among\r\nthese slaves for the further exploration and Christianization of the\r\nCoast, and even of the Upland. We know that he used some of them as\r\nguides and interpreters.[20]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: 1454 in O. Martins.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: 1447, according to Barros (_I_, i, 14) and\r\n    Galvano.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 20: Cf. Azurara, _Guinea_, chs. xiii, xvi.]\r\n\r\nOne of the latest voyages recorded by Azurara is that of \"Vallarte the\r\nDane\" (1448), which ended in utter destruction near the Gambia, after\r\npassing Cape Verde. The chronicler, though writing in 1453, does not\r\ncontinue his record beyond this year, 1448; his promise to give us the\r\nremainder of the Infant's achievements in a second chronicle seems never\r\nto have been fulfilled; and his descriptions of Madeira and the\r\nCanaries, in the latter part of the _Chronicle of Guinea_, are\r\nunfortunately of only slight value for the history of discovery. Yet,\r\nbefore the Prince's death in 1460[21] and in the last six years of his\r\nlife, several voyages of some importance prove that Azurara's silence is\r\nmerely accidental. Cadamosto's two journeys of 1455-6, and Diego Gomez'\r\nventures of 1458-60, advanced West African discovery almost to Sierra\r\nLeone. The former, a Venetian seaman in the service of Prince Henry,\r\nalso explored part of the courses of the Senegal and the Gambia and\r\ngained much information about the native tribes. One of his chief\r\nexploits, an alleged discovery of the Cape Verde islands, has been\r\ndisputed in the name of Diego Gomez, who in 1458-60 twice sailed to\r\nGuinea, and on the second voyage \"sighted islands in the Ocean, to which\r\nno man had come before.\" We postpone this point for further examination,\r\nonly adding that we believe Cadamosto's prior claim to be sound,\r\nalthough the islands in question do not appear in any document before\r\n1460.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 21: _Aliter_ 1462 or 1463 (Galvano and Barros, who\r\n    also date the discovery of C. Verde and the Senegal by \"Dinis\r\n    Fernandez,\" 1446: Barros, _I_ i, 9, 13); but this date is\r\n    certainly incorrect.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Prince, when his explorations (from 1441) first began to\r\npromise important results, obtained from Pope Eugenius IV a plenary\r\nindulgence to those who shared in the war against the Moors consequent\r\non the new discoveries,[22] and from the Regent D. Pedro he also gained\r\na donation of the Royal Fifth on the profits accruing from the new\r\nlands, as well as the sole right of permitting voyages to these parts.\r\nThe Infant's work, was moreover, recognised in bulls of Nicholas V\r\n(1455) and of Calixtus III (March 13th, 1456). In earlier\r\nlife--apparently soon after the capture of Ceuta and the embassy of\r\nManuel Palæologus asking for help against the Turks--he had been\r\ninvited, Azurara tells us, by a predecessor[23] of the Pontiffs\r\nabove-named to take command of the \"Apostolic armies,\" and similar\r\ninvitations reached him from the Emperor of Germany,[24] the King of\r\nEngland (Henry V or VI)[25] and the King of Castille.[26] We may also\r\nbriefly notice in this place, referring to a later page for a more\r\ndetailed treatment of the subject, that the Infant, in 1445 and 1446,\r\nrepeated his earlier attempts (in 1424 and 1425) to secure the Canaries\r\nfor Portugal, both by means of purchase and of armed force; and that,\r\nfrom 1444-5 especially, he colonised, as well as discovered, and traded\r\nwith increased energy in the Madeira Group, the Azores, and (if his\r\nexperiment at Arguim in 1448 may stand as an example) even on the\r\nmainland coast of Africa.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 22: Barros and Galvano make Prince Henry obtain\r\n    Indulgences from Pope Martin [V, who reigned 1417-31] in\r\n    1441-2, by the embassy of Fernam Lopez d'Azevedo (see p. xv).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: Martin V?]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 24: Sigismund?]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 25: Henry VI made the Infant a Knight of the Garter,\r\n    and is more likely than the conquering Henry V to have asked a\r\n    foreign Prince to aid him against the French.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 26: John II.]\r\n\r\nThe Infant's share in home politics was considerable, but this is not\r\nthe place to discuss it at any length. It is probably a correct surmise\r\nthat his ultimate ambition on this side was to detach Portugal as far as\r\npossible from Spain and Peninsular interests, and by making her a\r\nworld-power at and over sea, to give her that importance she could never\r\nof herself acquire in strictly European politics. We have already\r\nnoticed that after the victory of Ceuta he seems to have been made\r\nGovernor for life of the Algarve province[27] of Portugal, by his father\r\nKing John (1419); that he was a leading promoter of the scheme for the\r\nTangier campaign of 1437;[28] and that after the death of his brother\r\nKing Edward (Duarte), the successor of King John (September, 1438), he\r\nsupported the claims of his eldest surviving brother, Pedro, as regent\r\nand guardian of the young Affonso V, and by his wise counsels effected a\r\nreconciliation with Affonso's mother Leonor, acting for a time as\r\npartner in a Council of Regency with Pedro and the Queen. Further, it\r\nmust be said that, in 1447, when a long succession of differences\r\nbetween D. Pedro and his royal ward ended in an armed rising of the\r\nformer against \"evil Counsellors,\" Henry stood by the Sovereign, and\r\ntook, if not an active, at least a passive part in overthrowing the\r\ninsurrection, which was ended by the battle of Alfarrobeira (May 21st,\r\n1449). Finally, it is recorded that \"the Navigator\" somewhat recovered\r\nthe military honour he had compromised at Tangier, by his successes in\r\nthe African expeditions of Affonso V, especially at the capture of\r\nAlcacer the Little in 1458; in this last year he received his Sovereign\r\nin due form at or near Sagres, before sailing for \"Barbary.\" His\r\ntraditional but on the whole credible work as Protector of the Studies\r\nof Portugal has been alluded to already, in connection with his alleged\r\nfoundation of professorships of mathematics and theology in the\r\nUniversity of Lisbon, and of a school of nautical instruction and of\r\ncosmography at Sagres. This point, however, will be reconsidered in a\r\nfollowing section.[29]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 27: Technically \"kingdom.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 28: The \"Marocco Campaigns\" of 1418, 1437, 1458,\r\n    etc., were apparently considered by Prince Henry as only\r\n    another side of his coasting explorations and projected\r\n    conquests. Having then no idea of the enormous southerly\r\n    projection of Africa, he probably aspired to a Portuguese\r\n    North African dominion, which should control the Continent.\r\n    For Guinea, in the ideas of the time, was commonly supposed to\r\n    be quite close to Marocco on the south-west and west.\r\n    Apparently, soon after 1437, Henry was just starting on\r\n    another Moorish expedition, when the King and Council\r\n    \"hindered the voyage\" (see Az., ch. v, p. 20 of our version).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 29: \"School of Sagres,\" etc.]\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps in his connection with the fall of D. Pedro that the\r\nseverest criticism has been passed upon Henry the Navigator. \"Genius is\r\npitiless\" it has been said; and the action of the younger brother has\r\nbeen blamed as a piece of ruthlessness and ingratitude, though extolled\r\nby Azurara as a proof of loyalty under temptation. It may have seemed to\r\nhim impossible to support any rebellion, however justified, against\r\nroyal authority, or even to take the position of a neutral, when the\r\ncentral government of his country was on its trial. Our sympathies are\r\nusually with Pedro, as the most wise, liberal, and learned of his\r\npeople--with one exception--and as the victim of the intrigues of\r\ncourtiers, especially of King John's bastard son, the Count of Barcellos\r\nand Duke of Braganza; but the Governor of Algarve parted for ever from\r\nhis favourite brother when he took up arms to right himself; and perhaps\r\nhe was not more wrong than the people of England in refusing to allow\r\nthe nobles of the Tudor time to dictate to even the most despotic of our\r\nmore modern English sovereigns.[30]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30: It has been suggested, _e.g._, by Sir C.\r\n    Markham, that the portrait of the Infant in mourning dress\r\n    prefixed to the Paris MS. of Azurara represents him\r\n    immediately after the death of D. Pedro. It is perhaps more\r\n    likely a mark of sorrow for D. Fernand, the Constant Prince,\r\n    who died in his Moorish captivity, June 5th, 1443, and whose\r\n    heart was conveyed to Portugal, June 1st, 1451, and buried at\r\n    Batalha, Prince Henry joining the funeral procession at\r\n    Thomar.]\r\n\r\nThe Infant was, among his other dignities, Master of the Order of\r\nChrist, which, as the direct successor of the Templars in Portugal, held\r\na very high rank, and was, by its \"artificial ancestry,\" as Hobbes would\r\nhave said, one of the most ancient Orders in Christendom. Henry's\r\nfather, King John, had been also at one time Head of an Order of\r\nChivalry, the Knights of Aviz; but on coming to the throne he had\r\nobtained a dispensation from his vow of celibacy as Master, a\r\ndispensation which his son never required. The banner of this Order\r\nseems to have floated over most if not all of Prince Henry's African\r\nexpeditions; in its name he required the aid of Pope Eugenius IV; its\r\nspecial duty--military order as it was in origin--should have been to\r\nspread the Christian faith in Moslem and heathen Africa: perhaps its\r\nwork was considered to extend only to the slaying of Moslems, or\r\nMoormen, and the bringing back to Europe of heathen Africans who could\r\nbe reared as Christians in Portugal. No mission to preach the faith\r\nseems to have been undertaken by the Fraternity. Upon this Order the\r\nPrince bestowed the tithes of the Island of St. Michael in the Azores,\r\nand one half of its sugar revenues; also the tithe (afterwards reduced\r\nto the twentieth) of all merchandise from Guinea, as well as the\r\necclesiastical dues of Porto Santo, Madeira, and the Desertas. The\r\nPrince's nephew, D. Fernando, succeeded him (in 1460) in the Mastership\r\nof the Order of Christ.[31]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31: Already, in 1451, Henry had designated him as\r\n    his heir.]\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been said that the Infant Henry was also titular King\r\nof Cyprus. This assertion is derived from Fr. Luiz de Souza (_Historia\r\nde S. Domingos_, Bk. VI., fol. 331) and José Suares de Silva (_Memoirs\r\nof King João I._), who tell us that the Prince was elected King of\r\nCyprus. But this \"Kingdom\" remained in the posterity of Guy de Lusignan\r\ntill 1487; and the mistake has probably arisen from a confusion of\r\nHenry, Prince of Galilee, son of James I., King of Cyprus, with Prince\r\nHenry of Portugal.[32]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 32: Santarem corrects this; see note in Major's\r\n    _Henry Navigator_, p. 306. So Azurara's allusion, \"No other\r\n    _uncrowned_ prince in Europe had so noble a\r\n    household,\"--_Guinea_, ch. iv.]\r\n\r\nIn prosecuting his explorations, Prince Henry incurred heavy expenses.\r\nHis own revenues were not sufficient, and he was obliged to borrow\r\nlargely. Thus, in 1448, he owed his bastard half-brother, the Duke of\r\nBraganza, 19394½ crowns of gold, to pay which he had pledged his lands\r\nand goods; and this debt was afterwards increased by 16084 crowns, as\r\nstated in the declaration of the Duke of Braganza, November 8, 1449, and\r\nin the will of the same nobleman. These debts were partly paid by his\r\nnephew and adopted son, D. Fernando, and partly by Fernando's son, D.\r\nManuel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOYAGES OF PRINCE HENRY'S SEAMEN ALONG THE WEST AFRICAN COAST.\r\n\r\n(_Not recorded by Azurara._)\r\n\r\nPrince Henry's work was, above all, justified by its permanence. Unlike\r\nearlier ancient and mediæval attempts at West African exploration, his\r\nmovement issued in complete success. Azurara gives us, no doubt, a\r\nfairly complete account of the earlier stages of that movement, but it\r\nis probable that even his record omits some of the ventures undertaken\r\nfrom Portugal along the West African mainland; while it is certain that\r\nwe must look elsewhere for a completer picture of the Infant's activity\r\namong the Atlantic Islands and in the Great Ocean. These additional\r\nsources of information must be examined in turn. First of all, it will\r\nbe advisable to finish the chronicle of West African coasting down to\r\nthe Navigator's death. After that, the triumphant prosecution of this\r\nline of advance to the Cape of Good Hope will call for a brief notice.\r\nAnd, thirdly, something must be said about the progress of discovery and\r\ncolonisation in the archipelagos of Madeira, the Canaries, the Azores,\r\nand the Cape Verdes, especially considered in relation to that Westward\r\nroute to India which Columbus advocated and commenced.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that although Azurara's Chronicle officially\r\nends in 1453, and appears to record nothing later than the events of\r\n1448, yet very important expeditions were sent forth in the last years\r\nof the Prince's life, especially those of Cadamosto[33] and Diego Gomez.\r\nAn attempt has been made to prove that the second voyage of Cadamosto,\r\non which he claimed to have discovered the Cape Verde Islands, is\r\nuntruly reported and may be dismissed as fabulous. But there seems no\r\nsufficient ground for this. \"In an account of travels, printed long\r\nafter its author's death, some contradictory statements, possibly\r\narising through copyists' errors, do not justify such a conclusion.\" And\r\nthe mistakes contained in the assailed narrative are not serious or\r\nunexplainable enough for rejecting it as a whole.[34] Luigi, Alvise, or\r\nAloysius, da Ca da Mosto[35] was a young Venetian (a noble, according to\r\nsome) who had embarked on August 8, 1454, with Marco Zeno on a\r\ncommercial venture,[36] and was delayed by storm near Cape St. Vincent\r\nwhile on his voyage from Venice to Flanders. He now heard of the\r\n\"glorious and boundless conquests\" of Prince Henry, \"whence accrued such\r\ngain that from no traffic in the world could the like be had. The\r\nwhich,\" continues the candid trader, \"did exceedingly stir my soul,\r\neager as it was for profit above all other things, and so I made suit to\r\nbe brought before the Infant\"--who was then at the village of Reposeira,\r\nnear Sagres. Cadamosto was easily persuaded to sail in the service of\r\nPortugal,[37] and set out, with Vicente Diaz, on March 22, 1455. He\r\nvisited Porto Santo and Madeira, and at Cape Branco began a \"peaceful\r\nexploration\" of the interior, for the study of its natural conditions,\r\ninhabitants, trade, and so forth. Proceeding to the Senegal, he\r\ncontinued his investigations; which were extended to the Canaries as\r\nwell as to Madeira. He notices the fort built by the Prince's orders in\r\nthe Bight of Arguim (1448), and the new start lately made by Portuguese\r\ntrade with the natives. This trade at Arguim had included nearly a\r\nthousand slaves a year, so that the Europeans, who used to plunder all\r\nthis coast as far as the Senegal, now found it more profitable to trade.\r\nSlave-raiding among the Azanegue tribes north of the Senegal had ceased,\r\n\"for the Prince will not allow any wrong-doing, being only eager that\r\nthey should submit themselves to the law of Christ.\"[38] Before passing\r\nCape Verde, Cadamosto met with two ships, one commanded by a Genoese,\r\nAntonio, or Antoniotto, surnamed Ususmaris or Uso di Mare,[39] the other\r\nby an unnamed Portuguese in Henry's service. The expeditions united and\r\nsailed on together to the Gambia, where they were unable to open\r\nintercourse with the natives, and so returned to Portugal. Cadamosto\r\ngives very full descriptions of the life, habits, government, trade,\r\netc., of both the \"Moors\" (Azanegues) and Negroes (Jaloffs) of Guinea,\r\nwhich have been often noticed,[40] and sometimes paraphrased; and which\r\nshow a great development of commercial interest and statesmanlike\r\ninquiry on anything recorded in Azurara. At his furthest point the\r\nexplorer noticed that the North Star was so low that it appeared almost\r\nto touch the sea, and here he seems to have seen the Southern Cross.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 33: 1507 (Vicenza) Edition, is the earliest text of\r\n    Cadomosto's Voyages, printed in \"Paesi novamente retrovati et\r\n    novo mondo da Alberico Vesputio Florentino intitulato.\" This\r\n    was republished at Milan in 1508; and in this year two\r\n    versions appeared: 1. In Latin, by Madrignano, \"Itinerarium\r\n    Portugallensium ...,\" Milan. 2. In German, by Jobst Ruchamer,\r\n    \"Neue unbekanthe landte,\" Nürnberg. In 1516 appeared in Paris\r\n    a French version by Mathurin du Redouer: \"Sensuyt le nouveau\r\n    monde ...\" A good many discrepancies occur in these various\r\n    editions and translations.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 34: See pp. xcii-xcvi of this Introduction.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 35: House or Family (Casa) of Mosto.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 36: In 1454 the Venetian Senate ordered three\r\n    galleys to be equipped for the voyage to Flanders and England;\r\n    and ordered Marco Zeno, as commander, to enquire about the\r\n    goods of Venetian subjects landed in England.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 37: The Prince was said especially to wish for\r\n    Venetians to enter his service, as they knew more about the\r\n    spice trade than anyone; and he was convinced that his\r\n    expeditions would ultimately find spices (_i.e._, in India).\r\n    As to Vicente Diaz, cf. Azurara's _Guinea_, chs. lx, lviii,\r\n    etc.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 38: Cf. Azurara, _Guinea_, end of ch. xcvi.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 39: This seems one of the earliest notices of\r\n    non-Portuguese craft in these waters. But Uso di Mare was\r\n    almost certainly in the Prince's service, like \"Vallarte the\r\n    Dane,\" and \"Balthasar the German,\" noticed in Azurara,\r\n    _Guinea_, chs. xvi. and xciv. Uso di Mare's letter to his\r\n    creditors of December 12, 1455, seems to show that the\r\n    expedition had returned before Christmas.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 40: As in the collections of Ramusio, Temporal,\r\n    Astley, and Stanier Clarke; in Major, _Henry Navigator_, chs.\r\n    xv.-xvi.; and in \"Heroes of Nations\" life of Prince Henry, ch.\r\n    xvi.]\r\n\r\nIn the next year, 1456, Cadamosto sailed out again with Antoniotto Uso\r\ndi Mare, made straight for Cape Branco, and found, three days' sail from\r\nthis point, \"certain islands\" off Cape Verde \"where no one had been\r\nbefore.\"[41] The explorer then, in his own as well as in the official,\r\n\"Ramusian,\" or Venetian, account, proceeded to the Gambia, opened trade\r\nsuccessfully with the natives, and explored the coast \"about 25 leagues\"\r\nbeyond this river as far as the Bissagos Islands, or some point of the\r\nmainland not far distant.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 41: Of these two were \"very large,\" and on these\r\n    they landed, finding no inhabitants but plenty of animal life.\r\n    Five more isles were sighted in the distance, but not visited.\r\n    They called the first discovered \"Boa Vista,\" and the largest\r\n    of the group \"St. James,\" from the day of the discovery. This\r\n    is, of course, the Santiago which forms the centre of the Cape\r\n    Verde archipelago.]\r\n\r\nCadamosto's account of his two voyages is rightly praised[42] as\r\n\"detailed and vivid.\" He certainly compiled a map of his journeys, for\r\nin noticing the river Barbasini beyond Cape Verde, he says: \"I have\r\nnamed it so on the Chart which I have made.\" The interesting suggestion,\r\nthat some of Benincasa's portolanos (especially that of 1471) were based\r\non Cadamosto's descriptions and plans of the West African shore-land, is\r\nhardly susceptible of proof, but it is not without some corroborative\r\nevidence, as may be seen elsewhere.[43] Also, \"the journeys of this\r\nMarco Polo of West Africa were undertaken in a more scientific spirit,\r\nand were more free from chivalrous outrages,\" than most of those who\r\npreceded him along this coast.[44] This is not merely due to himself. It\r\nappears from his express statements that the Infant now discouraged\r\nslave-raiding, and urged his captains to something of higher value than\r\nseal and sea-calf hunting. The value of Cadamosto's work was mainly in\r\nhis observations and descriptions. He advanced only a little way beyond\r\nsome of the Prince's earlier explorers (_e.g._, Alvaro Fernandez),\r\nexcept for his discovery of the Cape Verde islands, but he seems to have\r\nnamed[45] and mapped out more carefully than before a good many points\r\nof the littoral beyond Cape Verde, and his writings surpass in\r\ngeographical value anything to be found in Azurara. His notes are also\r\nof high value for ethnology and anthropology, and give a better account\r\nof the trade-routes, etc. of North-west Africa than any Christian\r\nwriting of the time. Finally, he is more reliable than many subsequent\r\nand more pretentious travellers, and his narrative is as picturesque and\r\neffective as it is reliable. For \"one inquisitive person shall bring\r\nhome a better account of countries than twenty who come after him.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 42: See Nordenskjöld, _Periplus_, 120, and Map\r\n    section of this Introduction; also pp. xcii-xcvi of the same.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 43: See p. cxxxii of this Introduction.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 44: The same change is observable in the narrative\r\n    of Diego Gomez. Cf. his treatment of the Chief Bezeghichi,\r\n    whom he freely releases when in his power, in order to make\r\n    him less \"bitter against the Christians.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 45: _E.g._, the rivers Barbasini, Casamansa, Santa\r\n    Anna, St. Domingo, and Cape Roxo.]\r\n\r\nA little subsequent to what we may suppose was the second return of the\r\nVenetian adventurer from Africa, in 1456, the Infant sent out Diego\r\nGomez with orders to \"go as far as he could.\" The explorer passed a\r\n\"great river beyond the Rio Grande,\" when strong currents in the sea\r\nalarmed him and caused him to put back. Like Cadamosto, however, he\r\ntrafficked and conversed with the natives, especially of the Gambia, and\r\ngained some useful information about their trade, politics, and\r\ngeography. Some of the facts he related about wars among the negro\r\nstates of the interior were confirmed by a \"merchant in Oran,\" who\r\ncorresponded with the Prince.[46] As a result of Gomez' first voyage,\r\nthe Infant seems to have sent out, in 1458, a mission to convert the\r\nnegroes of the Gambia \"with a priest, the Abbot of Soto de Cassa, and a\r\nyoung man of his household named John Delgado.\" Two years after this\r\n(_i.e._, in 1460) Gomez went out again. Near the Gambia he fell in with\r\ntwo ships--one under Gonçalo Ferreira, of Oporto, who was trading in\r\nhorses with the negroes for native produce; the other was under Antonio\r\nNoli, of Genoa. Soon after, Gomez and Ferreira seized an interloper, one\r\nDe Prado, who had come to Cape Verde without permission to dispose of a\r\nrich cargo, as Gomez was informed by a \"caravel from Gambia.\" It is\r\nnoticeable how the West African trade had now increased, and how many\r\nexpeditions are incidentally mentioned in this one record of Gomez.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 46: An allusion of high importance. See the section\r\n    of this Introduction, \"Preliminary African Exploration,\"\r\n    especially pp. xlv, etc.]\r\n\r\nHe concludes by stating that he and Noli left the mainland coast, and\r\nafter sailing two days and one night towards Portugal, \"sighted islands\r\nin the Ocean,\" which are described in terms very similar to Cadamosto's.\r\nThese were certainly the Cape Verde Islands of modern geography, which\r\nare first mentioned in documentary history in a Portuguese Decree of\r\nDecember 3rd, 1460. Gomez makes no reference to any previous visit or\r\nclaim of a prior discovery of these islands, but that is natural enough.\r\n\r\nWas such a previous visit made? Around this point, and the consequent\r\nprior claim of the Venetian, a long controversy has been waged, which is\r\nbriefly discussed in the section of this Introduction on the \"Atlantic\r\nIslands\" (especially pp. xcii-xcvi).\r\n\r\nThe second voyage of Diego Gomez was probably among the last ventures of\r\nwhich the Prince received any account. He must have died soon after the\r\nsecond return of the explorer, who seems to have attended him in his\r\nlast illness (13th November, 1460). But it is probable that before his\r\nend he had prepared for the expedition which Pedro de Sintra carried out\r\nin 1461, and which is described by Cadamosto, apparently before the\r\nclose of 1463.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOYAGES OF THE PORTUGUESE COMPLETING PRINCE HENRY'S WORK.\r\n\r\nA word must be added on the completion of Prince Henry's work after his\r\ndeath, and by agents whom in many cases he had trained. King Affonso V,\r\nthough rather more of a tournament king than a true successor of the\r\ngreat Infant, such as John II, had yet caught enough of his uncle's\r\nspirit to push on steadily, though slowly, the advance round Africa. In\r\n1461 he repaired the fort in the Bight of Arguim and sent out Pedro de\r\nSintra[47] to survey the coast beyond Cadamosto's furthest point. De\r\nSintra proceeded 600 miles along the \"southern coast of Guinea,\" passed\r\na mountain which was called Sierra Leone (according to one account) from\r\nthe lion-like growl of the thunder on its summits, and turned back at\r\nthe point afterwards known as St. George La Mina.[48] Soon after\r\n(probably in 1462), Sueiro da Costa followed De Sintra,[49] but without\r\nany new results, and it was not till 1470 that a fresh advance was\r\nmade.[50] In 1469 King Affonso leased the West African trade to Fernam\r\nGomez, a citizen of Lisbon, for five years, Gomez paying 1,000 ducats a\r\nyear. To this lease was annexed the condition that Gomez should make\r\nannual explorations along the unknown West coast of Africa for 300\r\n_miglia_, counted from Sierra Leone, \"where Pedro de Sintra and Sueiro\r\nda Costa turned back.\"[51]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 47: This voyage is described by Cadamosto as an\r\n    appendix to his own voyages. A young Portuguese who\r\n    accompanied De Sintra described to Cadamosto the stretch of\r\n    coast now discovered beyond the Rio Grande, the anchorages of\r\n    the fleet, and the names given to points on the shore. \"This\r\n    account, without any rhetorical embellishment, is of special\r\n    interest as a specimen of a Portuguese sailing-direction from\r\n    a sailor of Henry the Navigator's School\" (Nordenskjöld,\r\n    _Periplus_, 121). De Sintra reached 5° further South than any\r\n    before him. His nomenclature still survives at many points:\r\n    _e.g._, Cape Verga, Sierra Leone, Cape Santa Anna, Cape del\r\n    Monte, Cape Mesurado. Cape Sagres, \"the highest promontory\r\n    they had ever seen,\" between Cape Verga and Cape Ledo, has\r\n    been re-named. De Sintra also noticed especially a \"great\r\n    green forest\"--\"Bosque de St. Maria,\" in 5° 30' N. lat.\r\n    (?)--and near his furthest point (at Rio dos Fumos) an immense\r\n    quantity of smoke from native fires. Cf. Hanno's language in\r\n    his _Periplus_, on the fiery rivers running down into the sea;\r\n    and see J. N. Bellin's _Petit Atlas Maritime_, Paris, 1764;\r\n    Part iii, Map 105.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 48: Elmina.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 49: According to some, he accompanied De Sintra in\r\n    the voyage of 1461.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 50: Cadamosto explicitly says that when he left\r\n    Portugal on February 1, 1463, no voyages had been made in\r\n    continuation of De Sintra's venture, recorded by him.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 51: According to Cadamosto's account, De Sintra had\r\n    gone a good deal further.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in 1470, Gomez sent out João de Santarem and Pedro de\r\nEscobar, accompanied by the two leading Portuguese pilots, Martin\r\nFernandez and Alvaro Esteves, as \"directors of the navigation.\" On the\r\n29th December, they discovered St. Thomas island, and on 17th January,\r\n1471, the Isle of St. Anne, afterwards Ilha do Principe, both close to\r\nthe Equator on the open side of the Bight of Biafra.\r\n\r\nAnother voyage seems to have been made, under Gomez' auspices, in 1471.\r\nFernando Po now reached the island in the angle of the Central African\r\ncoast which is still called after him; and men began to find that the\r\nEastern bend of the continent, which had been followed since 1445-6 with\r\nsome hope of a direct approach to Asia, now took a sharp turn to the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this disappointment, Fernandez and Esteves in 1472-3 passed\r\nbeyond the furthest of earlier travellers, and crossed the Equator[52]\r\ninto that Southern Hemisphere on the edge of which the caravels had long\r\nbeen hovering, as mariners like Cadamosto saw ever more clearly stars\r\nunknown in the Northern Hemisphere, and ever more nearly lost sight of\r\nthe Arctic pole. In 1474-5 Cape Catherine, two degrees South of the\r\nLine, was reached, and here the advance of exploration stopped for a\r\ntime till the accession of John II in 1481.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 52: It is not very clearly recorded who first\r\n    crossed the line among the Portuguese sailors of this time.\r\n    Some conclude as stated in text, but Nordenskjöld believes it\r\n    was \"perhaps Lopo Gonçalvez, after whom a promontory directly\r\n    south of the Equator is named\"; he also thinks this great\r\n    event was accomplished on Gomez' first expedition, under\r\n    Santarem, Escobar, Fernandez and Esteves, in 1470-1. As to\r\n    progress eastwards, towards India, it was much exaggerated by\r\n    many. While his caravels were still off the Guinea coast, King\r\n    Affonso V believed the meridian of \"Tunis, and even of\r\n    Alexandria,\" had been already passed.]\r\n\r\nNow, in six years, the slow advance of the past sixty was exceeded.[53]\r\nLess than four months after his father's death, John, who as heir\r\napparent had drawn part of his income from the African trade and its\r\nfisheries, sent out Diego de Azambuga, who in 1482 built under the\r\nKing's orders the celebrated fort at St. George La Mina. He trafficked\r\nwith success, but made no great advance along unknown Africa, even if he\r\ncommenced a new era in the permanent colonisation of the Continent. King\r\nJohn was not disposed to be satisfied with this. In 1484, Diego Cão was\r\nordered to go as far to the South as he could, and not to \"wait anywhere\r\nfor other matters.\" He penetrated to the mouth of the Zaire or Congo,\r\nwhere he erected (at Cape Padron?) a stone pillar in sign of\r\npossession,[54] and brought back four natives to Portugal. These he took\r\nout with him in his second voyage (1485); on this expedition Martin\r\nBehaim was (wrongly) said to have accompanied him. Cão claimed in this\r\nyear to have reached 22° S. lat., half way between the Congo and the\r\nCape of Good Hope; but this is probably an exaggeration;--18° S.\r\nlat.[55] perhaps marks his furthest point, rather than Walvisch Bay, as\r\nin the old tradition.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 53: It is probably right to ascribe great importance\r\n    to the work of Fernam Gomez, during his five years' lease. His\r\n    wealth gave a new character to the equipment of the African\r\n    Expeditions of Portugal. Formerly there had been too much\r\n    waste of energy through indefiniteness of object; too much\r\n    discretion had been left to mariners themselves; now the\r\n    definite contract for geographical discovery with the Crown\r\n    caused a more rapid and continuous advance, and long stretches\r\n    of coast were explored and mapped.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 54: According to King John's orders. Wooden crosses\r\n    (often of Madeira wood?) had hitherto been erected by\r\n    Portuguese discoverers in new lands. Now stone pillars 6 ft.\r\n    high were to be used, and on them was to be inscribed, in\r\n    Portuguese and Latin, the date, with the name of the reigning\r\n    monarch, and those of the discoverers.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 55: Near C. Frio. So it is placed (at _Arenarum\r\n    Aestuarium_ or _Manga das Arenas_) on Pl. X in Livio Sanuto's\r\n    _Geographia_ of 1588. We have mentioned that Martin Behaim, of\r\n    Nüremberg, claimed to have accompanied Cão to West Africa; but\r\n    his globe, so famous afterwards, executed in 1492 at the order\r\n    of the Nüremberg Town Council, shows very little evidence of\r\n    this. Behaim's West Africa is often obstinately Ptolemaic, at\r\n    the end of the century which had revolutionised the knowledge\r\n    of this part of the world. He inserts all the legendary\r\n    Atlantic islands, and puts the Cape Verdes far out of their\r\n    proper place.]\r\n\r\nAfter Cão's return, King John renewed his efforts with fresh energy.\r\nAlready, in 1484, a negro embassy to Portugal had brought such an\r\naccount of an inland prince, one \"Ogane, a Christian at heart,\" that all\r\nthe Court of Lisbon thought he must be the long lost Prester John, and\r\nmen were sent out to seek this \"great Catholic Lord\" by sea and land.\r\n\r\nBartholemew Diaz sailed in August 1486, with two ships, to try his\r\nfortune by the sea-route, and even if he could not reach the Prester's\r\ncountry, to discover as far as possible on the \"way round Africa.\" Two\r\nother envoys, Covilham and Payva, were sent out by way of \"Jerusalem,\r\nArabia, and Egypt,\" to find the Priest-King and the Indies; yet another\r\nexpedition was to ascend the Negro Nile, or Senegal, to its supposed\r\njunction with the Nile of Egypt; a fourth party started to explore a\r\nroad to Cathay by the North-East Passage.\r\n\r\nBartholemew Diaz, accompanied by João Iffante, rounded the southernmost\r\npoint of Africa, and passed some way beyond the site of the modern Port\r\nElizabeth. The picturesque story of his voyage is well known. He sailed\r\nwith two vessels of 50 tons apiece, in the belief that \"ships which\r\nsailed down the coast of Guinea might be sure to reach the end of the\r\nland by persisting to the South.\" His first pillar was set up at Angra\r\ndos Ilheos,[56] at the south side of Angra Pequena. He made another stay\r\nat Angra das Voltas, in 29° S. lat., immediately after passing the\r\nOrange River. Then, putting well out to sea, Diaz ran thirteen days due\r\nsouth before the wind, hoping by this wide sweep to round the furthest\r\npoint of the Continent, which many traditions agreed in fixing not very\r\nfar from his last halting-place. Finding the sea and air at last\r\nbecoming cold, he changed his course to east, and as no land appeared\r\nafter five days, to north. In this last course the Portuguese reached a\r\nbay where cattle were feeding, named by the Portuguese Angra dos\r\nVaqueiros, now Flesh Bay.[57] After putting ashore two natives (probably\r\nsome of those lately carried from Congo to Portugal, and sent out again\r\nto act as scouts for the European explorers), Diaz continued east to a\r\nsmall island still called \"Santa Cruz,\" W. of our Port Elizabeth, and\r\neven further to a river called, after his partner, Rio do Iffante, now\r\nthe Great Fish River, in 32° 23' S. lat., and midway between the present\r\nPort Elizabeth and East London, where the coast begins gradually but\r\nsteadily to trend north-east. Here the expedition put back, sighting on\r\nits homeward way the Land's End, or \"Cape of Storms,\" re-named by John\r\nII \"Cape of Good Hope\" on their return. Almost at the same time as Diaz'\r\nreappearance in Lisbon (Dec. 1487), Covilham, who had reached Malabar by\r\nway of Egypt, wrote home from Cairo more than confirming the hopes\r\nalready drawn from the success of the last maritime ventures. \"If you\r\nkeep southward, the continent must come to an end. And when ships reach\r\nthe Eastern Ocean, let your men ask for Sofala and the Island of the\r\nMoon (Madagascar), and they will find pilots to take them to India.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 56: ? Diaz Point, at the _Serra Parda_ or \"Dark\r\n    Hills\" of Barros.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 57: Some way beyond Cape Agulhas, and immediately to\r\n    the east of the River Gauritz.]\r\n\r\nYet another chapter of discoveries was opened by King John's expeditions\r\nfor the ascent of the Western Nile, and for the exploration of the\r\nNorth-East Passage to Cathay. Neither of these achieved complete\r\nsuccess, but some more light was gained upon the interior of Africa\r\n(where the Portuguese made such notable advances in the sixteenth\r\ncentury); it has even been claimed, but apparently without foundation,\r\nfor the explorers of John II, that a Portuguese discovery of Novaia\r\nZemlya rewarded their enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe great voyage of Vasco da Gama (1497-9) connected and completed the\r\nvarious aims of Portuguese enterprise, to which Prince Henry had given a\r\npermanent and organised form.\r\n\r\nThough he was not able to see in his own lifetime the fulfilment of his\r\nplans, both the method of a South-East Passage, and the men who finally\r\ndiscovered it, were, in a true sense, his--were inseparably associated\r\nwith his work. The lines of Portuguese advance, a generation after his\r\ndeath, continued to follow his initiative so closely, that, when a\r\ndifferent route to the Indies was suggested by Columbus, the government\r\nof John II refused to treat it seriously. And yet it was to the Infant's\r\nmovement--in part, at least--that Columbus owed his conception. \"It was\r\nin Portugal,\" says Ferdinand Columbus, \"that the Admiral began to\r\nsurmise that if men could sail so far south, one might also sail west\r\nand find lands in that direction.\" In another place[58] it will be\r\nquestioned how far a Portuguese movement America-wards can be credited\r\nto the mariners of Prince Henry's own time. It is plain that, whether he\r\nor his captains ever thought favourably of the chances of the Western\r\nroute, he and they alike devoted their main energies to its rival, the\r\nEastern or African coasting way. It is equally plain, on the other hand,\r\nthat the Infant's work produced a new interest in the world-science of\r\ngeography throughout Christendom, and so was indirectly responsible for\r\nquite as much as it directly aimed at accomplishing.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 58: See the section of this Introduction on the\r\n    \"Atlantic Islands,\" especially pp. ciii-cvi.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFRICAN EXPLORATION PRELIMINARY TO PRINCE HENRY'S WORK.\r\n\r\nThe first recorded African expedition along the Atlantic coast of Africa\r\nwas, if we accept the account of Herodotus, that of the Phœnicians sent\r\nout by Pharaoh Necho (_c._ 600 B.C.), who started from the Red Sea and\r\nreturned by the Pillars of Hercules and the Mediterranean.[59] Almost at\r\nthe same time (_c._ 570 B.C., according to Vivien de St. Martin's\r\nestimate) the great Phœnician settlement of Carthage attempted in\r\nreverse order a voyage of colonisation and discovery along the West of\r\nthe Continent outside the Straits. Eratosthenes refers to Phœnician (or\r\nCarthaginian) settlements already existing on what is now the coast of\r\nMarocco, both inside and outside the \"Pillars;\" this new expedition\r\nunder Hanno was intended to strengthen the old, as well as to found new\r\nplantations. It is often compared with a similar venture, \"to explore\r\nthe outer coasts of Europe,\" undertaken by Himilco, probably about the\r\nsame time.[60]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 59: Herod. ii, 158-9; iv, 42. These mariners took\r\n    three years on their voyage: landed, sowed crops, and lived on\r\n    the harvest during seasons unfavourable to navigation\r\n    (especially autumn); during part of their journey they were\r\n    astonished to find the sun on their right hand.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 60: This is first noticed by Aristotle, \"On\r\n    Marvellous Narratives,\" § 37; by Mela, _De Situ Orbis_, iii,\r\n    9; and by Pliny, _Natural History_, ii, 67, § 167-170, and\r\n    elsewhere. The _Periplus_ of Himilco seems to have been worked\r\n    up by Avienus (_c._ 400 A.D.) in the first 400 lines of his\r\n    poem, \"_De Ora Maritima_.\"]\r\n\r\nHanno[61] sailed from Carthage, according to our authority, with sixty\r\npenteconters, carrying 30,000(?) people, colonists and others, first to\r\nCerne,[62] which was as far distant from the Pillars of Hercules as the\r\nPillars were from Carthage. Then he ascended the river Chretes[63] to a\r\nlake. Twelve days' voyage south of Cerne he passed a promontory with\r\nlofty wooded hills,[64] and a little beyond this, a great estuary.[65]\r\nFive days more to the south brought him to the Western Horn,[66] and on\r\nthe other side of this he coasted along a \"fragrant shore,\" with\r\n\"streams of fire running down into the sea,\" and \"fiery mountains, the\r\nloftiest of which seemed to touch the clouds,\" and which he named[67]\r\n\"Chariot of the Gods.\"[68] Three days' sail beyond this was his furthest\r\npoint, the Southern Horn,[69] whence he returned directly to Carthage.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 61: One account of Hanno's voyage was preserved on a\r\n    Punic inscription in the temple of \"Kronos,\" \"Saturn,\" or\r\n    Moloch, at Carthage; the inscription was translated into Greek\r\n    by an unknown hand, probably about 300 B.C.; and this version\r\n    of the _Periplus_ still remains to us.

But the \"lofty green headland,\" the Western\r\n    and Southern Horns, the Chariot of the Gods, the gorillas\r\n    captured by the seamen, hardly seem to allow of this\r\n    restriction. Ancient enterprise was far more satisfactory than\r\n    ancient observation, and the inaccuracies of the latter should\r\n    not make us deny the former. Here the initial measurement, of\r\n    the distance from Cerne to the Pillars as being equal to the\r\n    distance from the Pillars to Carthage, because the time\r\n    occupied in sailing was equal, seems not only too vague a\r\n    reckoning, but inaccurate as ignoring one great difference.\r\n    Inside the straits, Hanno's duty was simply to sail forward;\r\n    outside, he had to plant colonists at suitable spots,--along a\r\n    coast, moreover, not so well known as that of North Africa to\r\n    the Carthaginians.]\r\n\r\nThe African voyages of Sataspes under Xerxes, and of Eudoxus of Cyzicus\r\nunder Ptolemy Euergetes II, cannot be regarded as of much importance.\r\nNeither probably reached Cape Verde (even if we are to attach any belief\r\nto their narratives). Sataspes[71] declared that his ship was stopped by\r\nobstructions in the sea at a point where lived on the ocean shore a\r\npeople of small stature, clad in garments made of the palm-tree.[72]\r\nThis was \"many months'\" sail south of Cape Soloeis or Cantin, and may\r\nstand for the neighbourhood of the Senegal, if it be not a mere\r\ntraveller's tale invented by Sataspes, as Herodotus seems to have\r\nthought, to excuse his failure to the Great King. Eudoxus[73] claimed to\r\nhave sailed so far, first along the eastern and then, along the western,\r\ncoasts of Africa, that he practically circumnavigated the Continent; but\r\nall the details with which we are favoured go to disprove his claim. For\r\ninstance, he implies that the Ethiopians reached by him on his farthest\r\npoint S.W. \"adjoined Mauretania.\" On the eastern coast he picked up a\r\nship's prow from a vessel which he was told had been wrecked coming from\r\nthe westward, and which mariners of Alexandria identified as a ship of\r\nGades--a very unlikely story in the face of the currents on the East\r\nAfrican coast.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 71: _Herodotus_, iv, 43. Similar excuses were given,\r\n    _e.g._ (1) by Pytheas in the North Sea; (2) by Arab and\r\n    Christian mediæval voyagers off Cape Non and Cape Bojador; (3)\r\n    by Arabs off Cape Corrientes (on the E. Coast of Africa).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 72: They lived in towns, he adds, possessed cattle,\r\n    were of harmless and timid disposition, and fled to mountains\r\n    on the approach of the strangers.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 73: _Posidonius_, in _Strabo_, ii, 3, § 4. Eudoxus\r\n    made three voyages (see also Pliny, _Hist. Nat._, ii, 67, who\r\n    bases his statement, like Mela, iii, 9, on Cornelius Nepos);\r\n    in the first two he sailed to India and was driven to points\r\n    on the East African coast; on the third he attempted to sail\r\n    round Africa to India by the West, but evidently did not reach\r\n    any distance beyond S.W. Mauretania (near C. Non). His first\r\n    voyage must have been before B.C. 117 (_d._ of Ptolemy\r\n    Euergetes II, Physcon), his other two subsequent to that year.\r\n    The narrative of Eudoxus was exaggerated by Pliny and\r\n    Pomponius Mela into the story that the navigator had actually\r\n    accomplished, in his own person, the voyage round Africa from\r\n    the Red Sea to Gades; but his achievements may be limited\r\n    thus: Two voyages from Egypt to India; a short distance of\r\n    African coasting beyond Guardafui, probably not as far as\r\n    Zanzibar; a short distance on the west coast beyond the S.W.\r\n    coast of our Marocco, probably not beyond Cape Non, or at\r\n    furthest Cape Bojador.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Pliny,[74] Polybius the historian also made a\r\nreconnaissance down the West coast of Africa, in the lifetime and under\r\nthe order of Scipio Æmilianus. He seems to have passed the termination\r\nof the Atlas chain, but Pliny's language does not warrant us in going\r\nany further.[75] He interweaves the great measurement of the Roman world\r\nunder Augustus by Agrippa, which is perhaps in part commemorated by the\r\nPeutinger Table, and which evidently took into its view the Hesperian\r\nPromontory,[76] and the Chariot of the Gods. Some have claimed for\r\nPolybius a voyage as far as the latter point, but this, if understood in\r\nthe sense of Sierra Leone, is highly improbable.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 74: _Hist. Nat._, v, i.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 75: The text here is very confused and difficult,\r\n    but the best editors give the following text for Pliny's\r\n    words: \"He (Polybius) relates that beyond Atlas proceeding\r\n    west there are forests.... Agrippa says that Lixus is distant\r\n    from Gades 112 miles. From the Chariot of the Gods to the\r\n    Western Horn is 10 days' voyage, and midway in this space _he_\r\n    (_i.e._, Agr., not Pol.) has placed Mt. Atlas.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 76: Or Western Horn.]\r\n\r\nWe must not here delay over classical attempts at African continental\r\nexploration; but it will be right to notice briefly: That in the age of\r\nPliny, as shown by the _Periplus of the Erythraean Sea_ (_c._ 70 A.D.),\r\nand in the age of Ptolemy, as shown in his _Geography_ (_c._ 139-162\r\nA.D.), the knowledge of the Græco-Roman world was extended down the East\r\ncoast of Africa at least as far as Zanzibar and its neighbourhood, and\r\ndown the Western coast to Cape Soloeis, or Cape Cantin: That beyond\r\nthese points only vague ideas obtained, though occasional travellers had\r\nventured further: That in the interior of Africa only the North coast\r\nregion, viz., Egypt and the \"Barbary States,\" were thoroughly well\r\nknown, though expeditions had at times crossed the Sahara, reached the\r\nSudan, and ascended the Nile to the marshes situate in 9° N. lat.: That,\r\neven if never seen or visited, at least something had been heard of the\r\nAfrican Alps in the neighbourhood of the Great Lakes, as well as of\r\nthose lakes themselves: That Ptolemy's work marks the highest point of\r\nancient knowledge in Africa, which began to decline from the age of the\r\nAntonines: That it is not probable even Ptolemy had any definite notions\r\nabout the Niger, though his text names such a stream in West Africa, and\r\nhis Map lays it down in a position not very distant from our Joliba:\r\nThat it is clear he was conscious of the vast size of the Continent in a\r\nway that none of his predecessors had grasped, while utterly ignorant of\r\nits shape towards the South, so that he even denied the primary fact of\r\nits practically insular form.\r\n\r\nLeaving to another section any notice of ancient exploration among the\r\nAfrican islands, it would also appear that Statius Sebosus, Juba, and\r\nMarinus of Tyre all made contributions to the knowledge of West Africa.\r\nThese contributions are now only preserved in the allusions or\r\nparaphrases of other authors; but it is clear that Sebosus, perhaps\r\nidentical with a Sebosus who was a friend of Catulus and a contemporary\r\nof Sallust and Cæsar, had made independent inquiries concerning the West\r\nor Ocean coast of the Continent;[77] that Juba,[78] who made the Nile\r\nrise in Western Mauretania, did similar work in the time of Augustus;\r\nand that Marinus preserved some original records of Roman expeditions\r\nwhich crossed the Great Desert,[79] apparently from Tripoli and Fezzan\r\nto the neighbourhood of the Central Sudan States.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 77: He was also the alleged author of a _Periplus_,\r\n    and a treatise on the _Wonders of India_, but he is only known\r\n    by Pliny's quotations.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 78: The younger, \"King of Numidia.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 79: Such as those of Julius Maternus and Septimius\r\n    Flaccus, which perhaps reached Lake Chad, probably in the time\r\n    of Trajan (98-117 A.D.), and of Cornelius Balbus under\r\n    Augustus (19 B.C.), which conquered the Garamantes of Fezzan.]\r\n\r\nAs the Roman Empire broke up, geographical knowledge naturally suffered,\r\nand Africa shared in this loss. But a considerable recovery was effected\r\nthrough the work of the Arabs, to whom the Infant Henry owed much.\r\n\r\nConfining our attention to Continental exploration, we may remark among\r\nother particulars: (1) That the Arab migration[80] to the East coast\r\nbeyond Guardafui in the eighth century began the extension of Moslem\r\ntrade-colonies, which at last reached Sofala. (2) That the coast near\r\nMadagascar, as well as that island itself, seems to have been known to\r\nthe great Arab traveller and geographer Masudi (\"Massoudy\") in the tenth\r\ncentury. (3) That the same writer considered the Atlantic or Western\r\nOcean unnavigable, but that even he preserves a record of one Arab\r\nvoyage thereon.[81] (4) That Edrisi, in the twelfth century, records\r\nanother voyage which touched the African mainland a good distance beyond\r\nthe Straits of Gibraltar.[82] (5) That Ibn Said, in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, relates a discovery of Cape Blanco.[83] (6) That overland\r\ncommunication between the Barbary States and the negroes of the Sudan\r\nwas originated by the Arabs, as a regular line of commerce, probably\r\nfrom the eleventh century at least.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 80: This migration led to the foundation of\r\n    Magadoxo, 909-951, and of Kilwa, 960-1000; later on of\r\n    Malindi, Mombasa, and Sofala. See Krapf, _Travels and\r\n    Missionary Labours_, etc., p. 522; G. P. Badger, _Imams ... of\r\n    Oman_, p. xiii; El-Belâdzory, _Futûh-el-Buldân_ (Ed.\r\n    Kosegarten), pp. 132-135. The immigrants came from the Red Sea\r\n    and Syria, according to Dr. Krapf, from Oman and the Persian\r\n    Gulf according to Badger (though Krapf admits a later Persian\r\n    element as well). This was the migration of the \"Emosaids\"\r\n    ('Ammu-Sa'îd, or People of Sa'îd?). They, in one tradition,\r\n    claimed to be the clan of Said, grandson of Ali; \"a mythical\r\n    personage,\" according to Badger, who substitutes \"Sa'îd,\r\n    grandson of Julánda\" the Azdite; the latter, in this 'Omâni\r\n    migration, was accompanied by his brother Suleimân. The\r\n    traditional date is A.D. 740, and onwards.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 81: Masudi, ch. 12 of the _Meadows of Gold_. The\r\n    adventurer was Khosh-Khash, the \"young man of Cordova,\" who\r\n    returned with great riches, from Guinea (?).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 82: See the section of this Introduction upon the\r\n    Atlantic Islands, pp. lxxv-lxxvii. Edrisi's Maghrurin or\r\n    Wanderers probably sailed from and returned to Lisbon before\r\n    1147, the date of the final Christian capture of that city,\r\n    and touched the African mainland at a point over against\r\n    Madeira.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 83: By one Ibn Fatimah, who was wrecked at Wad-Nun,\r\n    a little North of Cape Non, put off in a sloop with some\r\n    sailors, and at last came to a glittering white headland, from\r\n    which they were warned off by some Berbers. They learned\r\n    afterwards that it was one mass of deadly serpents. Thence\r\n    turning North they landed and went inland to the salt market\r\n    of Tagazza, and finally returned home.]\r\n\r\nThis last point is one which requires special consideration. By sea the\r\nArabs did scarcely anything to prepare the way for the Christian\r\ndiscoveries of the fifteenth century in Africa (except along the Eastern\r\ncoast), but by land they were the most important helpers and informants\r\nof Prince Henry.[84] Islam effected the conquest of the Barbary States,\r\npolitically in the seventh century, dogmatically in the course of about\r\n200 years after the days of Tarik and Musa. By the end of the eleventh\r\ncentury the faith of Mohammed had begun to spread and take deep root in\r\nthe Sudan,[85] having already made its way into many parts of the\r\nSahara. With the Moslem faith came the Moslem civilisation. The caravan\r\ntrade across the desert now commenced between Negroland and the\r\nMediterranean; \"Timbuktu\" was founded by Moslems, probably drawn in\r\nlarge measure from the Tuareg, in about 1077-1100; and the Central Sudan\r\nStates, from Sokoto to Darfur and Kordofan, passed under Mohammedan\r\ninfluence between A.D. 1000 and 1250. With the fresh migration of Nomad\r\nArabs which seems to have taken place about A.D. 1050, from Upper Egypt\r\nto West Africa, a distinct advance of Islam in Central Africa is to be\r\nnoticed by way of Kanem, Bornu, Sokoto, and the Niger Valley; this new\r\nwave reached Jenné, Ghiné, or \"Guinea\", on the Upper Valley of the\r\nNiger.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 84: Cf. what is said about Prince Henry's\r\n    correspondent, the merchant at Oran, p. xxvi of this\r\n    Introduction.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 85: Various early Arab MSS., lately found by the\r\n    French in Tombuttu (\"Timbuktu\"), especially the\r\n    _Tarik-es-Sudan_ of \"Abderrahman ben Amr-Sadi-Tombukkti,\"\r\n    according to Félix Dubois (_Tombouctou la Mystérieuse_),\r\n    supply important rectifications of the standard accounts here;\r\n    _e.g._ (1) Islam is found in the Western Sudan from the close\r\n    of the ninth century. (2) The Songhay were converted in 1010;\r\n    were for a time subject to the Kings of Melli; but gained\r\n    freedom in 1355. (3) The Songhay took Timbuktu in 1469; and\r\n    from this date, for more than a century, dominated all the\r\n    West and Central Sudan from their capital at Gao. (4) Jenné,\r\n    on the Upper Niger, was the furthest point westward of the\r\n    original Songhay migration from Nubia. It was founded in 765;\r\n    was converted to Islam in 1050, but \"Pagan idols\" were not\r\n    completely rooted out till 1475. (5) Jenné was, in the Middle\r\n    Ages, the greatest emporium of the Western Sudan, far\r\n    outshining Timbuktu, which owed its foundation in part to\r\n    Jenné. (6) Jenné was also a chief centre of Sudanese Islam.\r\n    Its great Mosque, built in the eleventh century, partially\r\n    destroyed in 1830, was the finest in all Negroland. (7) Its\r\n    control of the salt and gold trade, as well as of most other\r\n    branches of Sudanese merchandise, was such that it gave the\r\n    name of Guinea to a vast region of West Africa, especially\r\n    along the coast. (8) But Timbuktu, geographically, stood\r\n    between Jenné and Barbary, and so between Jenné and Europe,\r\n    and prevented Jenné from becoming famous in Christendom. (9)\r\n    Jenné was connected primarily with a migration from East to\r\n    West; Timbuktu, with a migration from North to South. (10)\r\n    Timbuktu was founded [α] by the Tuareg, who owed their new\r\n    energy in part to Moslem migrations from Spain, _c._ 1100\r\n    (1077 according to some authorities); [β], by merchants from\r\n    Jenné, who made it an emporium in the twelfth century. (11) In\r\n    the twelfth century, Walata, or Gana, in the great bend of the\r\n    Niger [? dominated by Jenné] was the most prosperous\r\n    commercial district of West Soudan; but in the thirteenth\r\n    century the conquests of the Kings of Melli [placed by these\r\n    authorities west-south-west of Timbuktu, to the north of the\r\n    Upper Niger] disturbed the old trade-routes, and diverted\r\n    commerce to Timbuktu; which, however, was never itself very\r\n    populous, and served chiefly as a place of passage and\r\n    commercial rendezvous. (12) From 1330 to 1434 the Kings of\r\n    Melli were usually masters of Timbuktu, where they built a\r\n    pyramid minaret for the chief mosque; but at least during some\r\n    years of the fourteenth century, Timbuktu was conquered by an\r\n    invasion from Mossi. (13) From 1434 to 1469, the Tuareg\r\n    regained possession of Timbuktu, and drove out the Melinki;\r\n    but in 1469 the Songhay took the town, and held it for more\r\n    than 100 years. (14) In the fourteenth century the Kings of\r\n    Melli built a great palace in Timbuktu, which did not\r\n    disappear till the sixteenth century. (15) From the fourteenth\r\n    century Timbuktu was the intellectual capital of the Sudan.\r\n    This was due to the Spanish-Moorish influence. (16) The patron\r\n    saint and doctor of Timbuktu, Sidi Yahia, was practically\r\n    contemporary (1373-1462) with Prince Henry the Navigator. (17)\r\n    The town of Kuku, Kuka or Kokia, in the W. Sudan, mentioned by\r\n    mediæval Moslem travellers, was probably either a city on or\r\n    near the Niger, immediately south of Gao, the Songhay capital;\r\n    or else Gao itself, which is sometimes called Kuku or Gogo.\r\n    Even this place was conquered by Melli, in the fourteenth\r\n    century, which thus dominated part of the Central Sudan. The\r\n    ruins of the great mosque at Gao still commemorate Kunkur\r\n    Musa, King of Melli, who built this house of prayer on his\r\n    return from the Mecca pilgrimage, about 1325. See\r\n    _Tarik-es-Sudan_, composed about 1656, and giving a history of\r\n    the Sudan down to that year: the fragments remaining of the\r\n    _Fatassi_ of Mahmadu-Koti (1460-1554); _Nil-el-Ibtihaj\r\n    bitatriz el-dibaj_, or Supplement to the Biographical\r\n    Dictionary of Ibn-Ferhun by Ahmed Baba, 1556-1627.]\r\n\r\nEven earlier than this a movement seems to have been in progress from\r\nthe opposite direction--first south along the west coast, and then east\r\nup the valley of the Senegal and similar inlets. The tradition preserved\r\nby John Pory[86] is approved by the most recent research--at least in\r\nits general conclusions. The Moslems \"pierced into\" the Sahara in, or a\r\nlittle after, 710, and \"overthrew the Azanegue, and the people of\r\nWalata;\" in \"the year 973 (others say about 950) they infected the\r\nnegroes and first those of Melli.\" During the ninth century, Islam made\r\nprogress among the Sahara tribes, and the influence of this faith\r\npromoted intercourse between the desert tribes and the great commercial\r\ncentres of the North African coast--a movement which was furthered by\r\nthe Almoravide revival of the eleventh, and the Almohade of the twelfth,\r\ncentury. The former started from a reformed Moslem \"community,\" settled\r\non an island at the mouth of the Senegal--in other words, it shows Islam\r\nalready finding centres for recovery and expansion in Negroland,\r\nexploring the Sudan from the north and west, creeping along the Atlantic\r\nOcean, and spreading from the neighbourhood of Cape Verde into the\r\ninterior of the populous land to the south of the Great Desert.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 86: In his \"Summary Discourse of the Manifold\r\n    Religions in Africa,\" printed at the end of the Hakluyt\r\n    Society's Edition of Pory's (1600) Translation of _Leo\r\n    Africanus_, vol. iii, especially pp. 1018-1021.]\r\n\r\nHere we may notice that Edrisi takes a point called Ulil as his\r\nstarting-place in reckoning measurements, and especially longitudes, in\r\nthe Sudan. This Ulil is fixed by all our authorities as close to the\r\nsea, in the centre of a salt-producing district; and it may be supposed\r\nto have been in the neighbourhood of the Senegal estuary.[87] To the\r\neast, Ulil bordered on Gana, Ghanah, Guinoa, Geneoa, or \"Guinea,\" which,\r\nat least in name, was the first objective of Prince Henry's expeditions,\r\nand was famous for its slave export, and its money of \"uncoined\r\ngold.\"[88] The name of the country was probably derived from its chief\r\ncity of Jenné, variously described by Leo Africanus, in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, as a large village; by the earlier geographers--especially\r\nEdrisi in the twelfth century, and Ibn-Batuta in the fourteenth--as a\r\nspacious and well-built city on an island in the Niger, lying west from\r\nTimbuktu.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 87: See Edrisi, Climate I, § i; Wappaüs, _Heinrich\r\n    der Seefahrer_, pp. 65, etc.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 88: Similar language is used by Abulfeda, who calls\r\n    it the seat of the King of Gana (whither come the western\r\n    merchants of Segelmesa), situate on a Nile, twin-brother of\r\n    the Egyptian, which flows into the Ocean; also by\r\n    Ibn-al-Wardi, who calls Ghanah city one of the greatest in the\r\n    land of the Blacks, placed on both sides of the Negro Nile,\r\n    and resorted to for gold by merchants, twelve days' journey\r\n    from Segelmesa. Edrisi (Climate I, section ii; ed. Jaubert, i,\r\n    16-18; also see i, 11, 13, 15, 19-20, 23, 106, 109, 173-4,\r\n    206, 272) is the most specific of all. \"Ghanah the Great, made\r\n    up of two towns on the banks of a sweet-water river ... the\r\n    most populous and commercial city in Negroland. Merchants come\r\n    there from all surrounding countries, and from the extremities\r\n    of the West ... it was built in A.H. 510\" (= A.D. 1116) (see\r\n    also Leo Africanus, Hakluyt Soc. ed., pp. 124, 128, 822,\r\n    840).]\r\n\r\nBetween Ghanah or Jenné, and Ulil, according to some writers, lay the\r\nkingdom of Tokrur, while Andagost was on the northern boundary of Ghanah\r\nclose to the Sahara. All these were Moslem states like Melli or Malli\r\n(W.S.W. from Timbuktu), and carried on trade with Barbary across the\r\ndesert long before the days of Prince Henry. One of the earliest\r\nimportant converts to Islam in the Sudan was Sa-Ka-ssi, of the dynasty\r\nof Sa in the Songhay country on the Middle Niger (_c._ A.D. 1009-1010).\r\nFrom this time the states on the Middle Niger became a centre of\r\nMohammedan influence, especially after the foundation of Timbuktu about\r\n1077. When Ibn-Batuta visited these parts in 1330, he found the negroes\r\nof the Niger full of Moslem devotion, enjoying a commerce with\r\nMediterranean Africa, and mostly acknowledging the lead of Melli, which\r\nkingdom, according to him, had been founded in the early thirteenth\r\ncentury by the Mandingo.[89]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 89: See Ibn-Batuta (Defrémery and Sanguinetti), iv,\r\n    395, 421-2; also Oppel, _Die religiöse Verhältnisse von\r\n    Afrika_, Zeitschrift of Berlin Geog. Soc., xxii, 1887.]\r\n\r\nAmong the Lake Chad States progress was also made in the eleventh\r\ncentury. The first Moslem Sultan of Bornu (Hami ibnu-l-Jalil) is\r\nrecorded about 1050;[90] and a similar conversion happened in Kanem\r\nabout the same time. This latter kingdom was then more important than\r\nnow, and dominated much even of the Egyptian Sudan. Hence in the\r\nfourteenth century Islam obtained a strong footing in Darfur, as it had\r\nalready in Baghirmi and Wadai.[91] Already in the twelfth century,\r\nKordofan and the extreme east of the Sudan had been partially Moslemised\r\nby Arabs from Egypt, who had come south after the fall of the Fatimite\r\nCaliphs.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 90: See Otto Blau, _Chronik von Bornu_, p. 322, Z.\r\n    D. M. G., vi, 1852.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 91: The more complete Islamising of Wadai, Darfur,\r\n    and Baghirmi did not take place till the sixteenth and\r\n    seventeenth centuries. See Slatin Pasha, _Fire and Sword in\r\n    Soudan_, pp. 38-42; T. W. Arnold, _Preaching of Islam_, chs.\r\n    iv, xi.]\r\n\r\nAlong the eastern coast, in spite of the early spread of Moslem\r\nsettlements from Magadoxo southward, Islam was very slow in penetrating\r\nthe interior. Here the Arabs chiefly devoted themselves to maritime\r\ncommerce, and for a long time their intercourse with the inland tribes\r\nwas not of a kind to open up the country. Caravans with slaves and\r\nnatural products came down to the coast towns, but the merchants of the\r\nlatter seem to have been content with waiting and receiving. But on this\r\nside of Africa was a Christian kingdom, which was now--in Prince Henry's\r\ndays--becoming more familiar to Europe: Abyssinia, the kingdom of\r\nPrester John, as the Portuguese of later time identified it. The\r\noriginal seat of the Priest-King, as described (chiefly from Nestorian\r\ninformation) by Carpini, Rubruquis, Marco Polo, and other Asiatic\r\ntravellers of the thirteenth century, was in Central Asia, but the\r\nAbyssinian state offered so close a parallel, that it was naturally\r\nrecognised by many as the true realm of Prester John, when the first\r\nclear accounts of it came into Mediæval Europe. The Asiatic prototype,\r\nmoreover, was only temporary; it had apparently ceased to exist in the\r\ntime of Polo himself, who spread its fame so widely; whereas its\r\nAbyssinian rival was both permanent and ancient enough to be noticed in\r\npre-Crusading and even in pre-Mediæval literature. As the Renaissance\r\nmovement progressed in Europe, learned men of the West gained from their\r\nreading an ever clearer realisation of this isolated Christianity of the\r\nEast; and, as the trade of the later Middle Ages spread itself more\r\nwidely, the Venetians seem to have made their way to the Court of the\r\nNegus, even before John II of Portugal sent Covilham and Payva (1486) to\r\nfind the Prester. Probably the beginnings of this Italian intercourse\r\nwith Abyssinia may be placed as far back as the lifetime of Prince Henry\r\n(_c._ 1450).\r\n\r\nThe Christianity of Nubia, which dated from the fourth century like that\r\nof Abyssinia itself, was still vigorous in the twelfth,[92] but from\r\nthat time it began to fail before the incessant and determined pressure\r\nof Islam. Ibn-Batuta,[93] about 1330-40, found that the King of Dongola\r\nhad just become a Moslem. Father Alvarez, in 1520-7, considered that the\r\nNubian Christianity which had once extended up the Nile from the first\r\nCataract to Sennaar had become extinct; though he would not allow that\r\nthe mass of the Nubians had adopted any other religion in its place;[94]\r\nand himself, he tells us, had met a Christian who, in travelling through\r\nNubia, had seen 150 churches.[95] But, in the course of the sixteenth\r\nand seventeenth centuries, all Nubia embraced Islam; and even in 1534,\r\nAhmad Gragne, King of Adel, in one of his attacks upon Abyssinia, is\r\nsaid to have had 15,000 Nubian allies, apparently all Mohammedans.[96]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 92: Edrisi, Climate I, section iv; vol. i, p. 35\r\n    (Jaubert). See Duchesne, _Eglises Séparées_.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 93: _Ibn-Batuta_, iv, 396. (Defrémery and\r\n    Sanguinetti).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 94: See _Alvarez_, Hakl. Soc. Edition, p. 352.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 95: Ruins?]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 96: See Nerazzini, _Musulman Conquest of Ethiopia_,\r\n    Rome 1891. (Ital. Transl. from Arab MS.).]\r\n\r\nIn Prince Henry's day, then, we may fairly assume that the old\r\nChristianity of East Africa was practically limited to Abyssinia; but\r\nwhen Azurara tells us of the Infant's desire \"to know if there were in\r\nthose parts[97] any Christian Princes,\"[98] and again more explicitly,\r\n\"to have knowledge of the land of Prester John,\"[99] it is possible that\r\nsome dim acquaintance with the old tradition of an isolated African (as\r\nwell as of an isolated Asiatic) Church, was at the root of his\r\nendeavour.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 97: Africa.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 98: _Azurara_, c. vii.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 99: _Ibid._, c. xvii.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the twelfth century, Islam had already begun to encroach\r\nupon the coast of what is now Italian \"Erythraea;\" and about 1300 A.D. a\r\nMusulman army attacked the ruler of Amhara. At this time the realm of\r\nthe Negus seems to have been completely cut off from the Red Sea;[100]\r\nbut it was not till the early sixteenth century that Abyssinia was in\r\nserious danger of becoming a province of Islam, from the attacks of\r\nAhmad Gragne (1528-1543), which, however, ended in complete failure.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 100: See Maqrīzī, _Histoire des Sultans Mamlouks de\r\n    l'Egypte_, Quatremère, 1837-45, t. ii, Pt. 11, p. 183.]\r\n\r\nTo return to the North coast of Africa. Here, by the capture of Ceuta,\r\nPrince Henry gained a starting-point for his work; here he is said\r\n(probably with truth) to have gained his earliest knowledge of the\r\ninterior of Africa; here especially he was brought in contact with those\r\nSudan and Saharan caravans which, coming down to the Mediterranean\r\ncoast, brought news, to those who sought it, of the Senegal and Niger,\r\nof the Negro kingdoms beyond the desert, and particularly of the Gold\r\nland of \"Guinea.\" Here also, from a knowledge thus acquired, he was able\r\nto form a more correct judgment of the course needed for the rounding or\r\ncircumnavigation of Africa, of the time, expense, and toil necessary for\r\nthat task, and of the probable support or hindrance his mariners were to\r\nlook for on their route.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, qualify in passing the statements of Azurara, in ch.\r\nvii, which would imply that Christianity had for ages been utterly\r\nextinct in North Africa. \"As it was said that the power of the Moors in\r\n... Africa was ... greater than commonly supposed, and that there were\r\nno Christians among them.\" \"During the one-and-thirty years that he had\r\nwarred against the Moors, he had never found a Christian King nor a lord\r\noutside this land,[101] who for the love of ... Christ would aid\r\nhim.\"[102] The old North African Church, though constantly declining,\r\nsurvived the Musulman Conquest of the seventh and eighth centuries for\r\nnearly 800 years. True, its episcopate, which could still muster 30\r\nmembers in the tenth century, was practically extinct by the time of\r\nHildebrand[103] (Pope Gregory VII), and in 1246 the Franciscan\r\nmissionary bishop of Fez and Morocco was the only Christian prelate in\r\n\"Barbary\"; but a number of native Christians still lingered on, though\r\nwithout Apostolic succession. In 1159, the Almohade conqueror, Abdu-'l\r\nMu'min ben Ali, on subduing Tunis, compelled many of these to change\r\ntheir faith; but all through the next centuries, down to 1535, a certain\r\nnumber of Tunisians preserved their ancient religion so far that, when\r\nCharles V gained possession of the city in the above-named year (1535),\r\nhe congratulated these perseverants on their steadfastness. The same\r\nfact is evidenced by the tolerant behaviour, as a rule, of the Mediæval\r\nBarbary States towards Christians, both native and European.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 101: Portugal.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 102: To find such a \"Christian Lord\" in the person\r\n    of Prester John was said to have been one of the chief objects\r\n    of D. Pedro's travels. This object Pedro avowed in Cairo; and\r\n    with this, among other aims, he visited not only Egypt but\r\n    Sinai and the Red Sea (see Martins, _Os Filhos_, pp. 83, 97,\r\n    121-2, etc., and pp. xvii-xviii of this volume).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 103: In 1076, the Church of Barbary could not\r\n    provide three bishops to consecrate a new member of the\r\n    Episcopate, and Gregory VII named two bishops to co-operate\r\n    with the Archbishop of Carthage (See Migne, _Pat. Lat._,\r\n    cxlviii, p. 449; Mas Latrie, _Rélations de l'Afrique\r\n    septentrionale avec les Nations chrétiennes au Moyen Age_, p.\r\n    226). In 1053, Leo IX declared that only five bishops could be\r\n    found in North Africa (Migne, _P. L._, cxliii, p. 728). On the\r\n    thirty bishops of the tenth century, see Mas Latrie, _Ibid._\r\n    pp. 27-8. It is curious to find Gregory II, in _c._ 730,\r\n    forbidding St. Boniface of Mainz to admit emigrants from North\r\n    Africa to Holy Orders without inquiry (Migne, _P. L._, lxxxix,\r\n    p. 502)--a remarkable proof of mediæval emigration.]\r\n\r\nThus they employ Christian soldiers, among others; grant freedom of\r\nworship to Christian merchants and settlers; and exchange letters with\r\nvarious Popes, especially Gregory VII, Gregory IX, Innocent III, and\r\nInnocent IV, on the subject of the due protection of native\r\nChristians.[104] Traces of Christianity were to be found among the\r\nKabyles of Algeria down to the time of the capture of Granada (1492),\r\nwhen a fresh influx of Andalusian Moors from Spain completed the\r\nconversion of these tribes,[105]--a conversion which, as Leo Africanus\r\nnotices, was not inconsistent with some survivals of Christian custom.\r\nSimilar survivals have been alleged among the Tuâreg of the Sahara, the\r\n\"Christians of the Desert\" at the present day.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 104: See Mas Latrie, _Afrique Septentrionale_,\r\n    _passim_, and especially pp. 61-2, 192, 266-7, 273.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 105: See C. Trumelet, _Les Saints de l'Islam_\r\n    (1881), pp. xxviii-xxxvi. In this connection we may notice one\r\n    or two other traces of intercourse between the Moslems of\r\n    Granada and those of Africa, _e.g._ (1) Ibn-Batuta's mention\r\n    of the tomb of the poet Abu Ishak es Sahili, born in Granada,\r\n    died and buried in Timbuktu, 1346. (2) Leo Africanus' notice\r\n    of the stone mosque and palace in Timbuktu, the work of an\r\n    architect from Granada in the fifteenth century. On Timbuktu,\r\n    see Ibn Batuta (Def. and San.), iv, 395, 426, 430-2; Leo Afr.\r\n    (Hakluyt Soc.), 4, 124, 128, 133-4, 146, 173, 255, 306, 798,\r\n    820, 822-4, 842.]\r\n\r\nTwo practical questions arise for our special purpose from this summary\r\nof the mediæval progress and fifteenth-century status of Islam in\r\nAfrica. These questions have been partly answered already, but we may\r\nhere re-state them to generalise our conclusions. 1. What information\r\nwas the Infant able to gain from the \"Moors\" for his own plans? and 2.\r\nWas this \"Moorish\" information so valuable as to account, in any great\r\ndegree, for the Prince's perseverance and success in his task?\r\n\r\nTo the former query it may be replied: 1. That the \"Arabs and Moors\" of\r\nthe early fifteenth century could give the Infant detailed and correct\r\ninformation, not only about the Barbary states and the trade-routes of\r\nthe Sahara, but also about many of the Western and Central Sudan\r\ncountries, and about the general course and direction of the \"Guinea\r\ncoast\" both to the west and south of the great African hump. Especially\r\ncould they describe the kingdom of Guinea, centreing round the town of\r\nJenné on the Upper Niger, which was the chief market of their Negro\r\ntrade in slaves, gold, and ivory. This kingdom, then, reached almost to\r\nthe Atlantic on the lower valley of the Senegal, where in earlier times\r\na place called Ulil had been marked by Edrisi and other Arab\r\ngeographers, as independent of Ghanah but important for traffic. Also,\r\nthe Moors were acquainted with the country of Tokrur,[106] which may be\r\nsupposed to occupy the upper valley of the Senegal, becoming perhaps, in\r\nPrince Henry's time, merely a province of Guinea. Further, they could\r\ngive much information about the States of Timbuktu and Melli, to the\r\neast of Guinea, on the Middle Niger, about the gold land of Wangara, in\r\nthe great bend to the south of that river, and about the Songhay,\r\nafterwards so powerful, whose capital was at Gao, at the extreme N.E.\r\nangle of the Negro Nile, or Joliba. The Arab travellers and writers seem\r\ngenerally to have made but one river out of the Senegal, the Niger,\r\nJoliba, or Quorra, and the Benué or \"river of Haussa.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 106: But in one view Tokrur is merely a generic name\r\n    for the Sudan and Sudanese, and is only by mistake converted\r\n    into a definite kingdom by Arab writers of second-rate\r\n    authority.]\r\n\r\nDe Barros explicitly states that the Moors told Prince Henry how on the\r\nother side of the Great Desert lived the Azanegues, who bordered on the\r\nJaloff negroes, where began the kingdom of Guinea, or Guinanha. From\r\nother sources we know, as already stated, that the Infant obtained from\r\nthe same informants[107] definite descriptions of the Senegal estuary,\r\nits \"tall palms,\" and other landmarks. For here, rather than at any\r\npoint more to the south, was the Guinea coast proper of the fifteenth\r\ncentury; though in the Bull of Pope Nicholas V, granting to Portugal\r\n(1454) all the lands that should be discovered \"from the Cape of Bojador\r\nand of Nun throughout the whole of Guinea, as far as its _Southern\r\nshore_, or even to the Antarctic Pole and the Indies,\" our modern\r\nextension of the term is virtually admitted.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 107: From the same he may have heard the tradition\r\n    of Bakui's voyage in 1403, from the Maroccan coast to about\r\n    the latitude of the Bight of Arguim, a parallel adventure to\r\n    Ibn Fatimah's. See above, p. xliv.]\r\n\r\n2. And, in the second place, granting what has just been said, it is\r\nobvious that the Moorish information was important enough to have very\r\nconsiderable influence on the Infant's plans, and especially to furnish\r\nhim with hopes of success, and reasons for perseverance in the face of\r\nopposition and repeated failure.\r\n\r\nOur materials for the Prince's life are so inadequate that we can hardly\r\ndecide, from the silence of our authorities, that he was entirely\r\nignorant, even at second hand, of all that the Arab geographers or\r\ntravellers had written about Africa. Especially is this the case with\r\nEdrisi (1099-1154), whose work was composed in the Christian kingdom of\r\nSicily, and owed much to Christian writers. And perhaps the same hope\r\napplies to Ibn-Batuta (_fl._ 1330), who, living at a time so near to the\r\nepoch of the Prince's voyages, had revealed the Western Sudan to the\r\nMoslem world--and so to any Christians conversant with Moslem trade and\r\nenterprise--far more thoroughly than ever before. These are only two\r\nexamples among those Moslem geographers, whose work may have been\r\nbrought to the Infant's notice during his visits to Ceuta.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWe have now to see what progress had been made by Christian nations in\r\nthe exploration of Africa immediately before Prince Henry's time. The\r\nCrusades were not merely expeditions to recover the Holy Sepulchre: they\r\nwere the outward sign of the great mediæval awakening of Europe and\r\nChristendom, which, beginning in the eleventh century, has never\r\nslumbered since, and which, in the Infant's days, was passing through\r\nthat great transition we call the Renaissance. On the geographical side\r\nthis movement took first of all the direction of land travel, and\r\nachieved such great discoveries in Asia that a new desire for wealth and\r\ncommercial expansion was kindled in Europe, with the special object of\r\ncontrolling the Asiatic treasures which Marco Polo and others had\r\ndescribed. Islam, however, interposed a troublesome barrier between\r\nCentral Asia, India and China on the one side, and European trade or\r\ndominion on the other. Hence, from the thirteenth century, we find a new\r\nseries of attempts to reach the Far East by sea from the Atlantic and\r\nMediterranean coasts. It was not till the last years of Prince Henry's\r\nlife that any serious attempts were made to explore the interior of\r\nAfrica, but expeditions along its shores were sent out long before his\r\ntime to reconnoitre for a sea-route to India.[108] We have already\r\nremarked that the Infant represents in his own life-work the leading\r\ntransition in this movement, from a tentative, impermanent, and\r\nunorganised series of efforts, to a continuous, properly directed, and\r\nsuccessful plan; but some notice must be taken of those ventures which\r\nimmediately prepared his way. Leaving out of sight, for another section\r\nas far as possible, the voyages which are concerned only with the\r\nAtlantic islands, or aim in a rudimentary way at finding a Western route\r\nto Asia, it is possible to mention several genuine attempts to\r\nanticipate the Portuguese along the Eastern or African mainland course.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 108: Raymond Lulli [\"of Lull\"] is thought by some to\r\n    have made the first definite suggestion of this route in the\r\n    central mediæval period. This \"doctor illuminatus\" was born at\r\n    Palma in Majorca, 1235, became a Franciscan Tertiary in 1266,\r\n    and died 1315. We may perhaps connect him with the very early\r\n    school of portolano-draughtsmanship in the Balearics. See Map\r\n    section of this Introduction.]\r\n\r\nThe first of these, as far as known, is the voyage of Lancelot\r\nMalocello, of Genoa, in 1270. There is no proof that he started, like\r\nthe adventurers of 1291, to find the ports of India: it is probable his\r\nambitions were more modest; but we do not know how far he reached along\r\nthe African mainland--only that he touched the Canaries, and staying\r\nthere some time built a castle in Lancarote[109] island.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 109: = Lancelote? See pp. lxxviii-lxxix.]\r\n\r\nThe next venture in this direction is also Genoese. In May, 1291,[110]\r\nTedisio Doria and Ugolino de Vivaldo, with the latter's brother and\r\ncertain other citizens of Genoa, equipped two galleys \"that they might\r\ngo by sea to[wards] the ports of India and bring back useful things for\r\ntrade.\" But \"after they had passed a place called Gozora,[111] nothing\r\nmore certain has been heard of them.\" This is confirmed by Pietro\r\nd'Abano, writing in 1312; but in the fifteenth century one of Prince\r\nHenry's captains, the Genoese colleague of Cadamosto, Antoniotto\r\nUsusmaris or Uso di Mare, professed to give some more details. On\r\nDecember 12th, 1455, he wrote his creditors a letter, in which he\r\nstated[112] that the two galleys of \"Vadinus and Guido Vivaldi,\" leaving\r\nGenoa in 1281 \"for the Indies,\" reached the \"Sea of Ghinoia,\" where one\r\nship was stranded, but the other sailed on to a city of Ethiopia called\r\nMenam, where lived Christian subjects of Prester John, who held them\r\ncaptive. None ever returned, but Uso di Mare himself spoke with the last\r\nsurviving descendant of those Genoese.[113] Menam, he concludes, was on\r\nthe sea coast, near the river Gihon.[114]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 110: According to some authorities, 1281. See\r\n    Giustiniani, _Castigatissimi Annali di Genova_, 1537, fol.\r\n    cxi, verso. Giustiniani refers to Francesco Stabili, otherwise\r\n    Cecco d'Ascoli, in his Commentary on the _De Sphaera Mundi_ of\r\n    Sacrobosco (John of Holywood, in Yorks, _c._ A.D. 1225). The\r\n    year 1291 corresponds with the fall of Acre, and the\r\n    consequent embarrassment of the Syrian overland routes to\r\n    Inner Asia.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 111: At or near Cape Non, which, on the Pizzigani\r\n    Map of 1367, is marked \"Caput Finis Gozole.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 112: This statement, it has been conjectured, was\r\n    intended for use in a \"forthcoming globe or map.\" Uso di\r\n    Mare's statement was first noticed by Gräberg af Hemsö. See\r\n    Peschel, _Erdkunde_, p. 179 (Ed. of 1865); Major, _Henry\r\n    Navigator_, 99-106 (Ed. of 1868), P. Amat di S. Filippo,\r\n    _Studi biografici_, etc. (Ed. of 1882), i, p. 77, for recent\r\n    studies on the general question of the Genoese Voyage of 1291,\r\n    and Uso di Mare's letter. The earliest modern notice of the\r\n    account of this voyage in the Public Annals of Genoa was by G.\r\n    H. Pertz, in his memoir, \"Der älteste Versuch zur Entdeckung\r\n    des Seewegs nach Ostindien\", offered to the Royal Academy of\r\n    Sciences at Munich, March 28th, 1859 (_Festschrift_, Berlin,\r\n    1859). The Genoese Annals referred to are a continuation of\r\n    the Chronicles of Caffaro. Muratori has printed an abstract of\r\n    the narrative. See also Nordenskjöld, _Periplus_ (1897), pp.\r\n    114, 116; _Nouvelles Annales des Voyages_ (d'Avezac), vol.\r\n    cviii, p. 47.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 113: In 1455?]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 114: Nile.]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to attach great weight to Uso di Mare's letter, which\r\nlooks like an attempt to amuse his creditors with interesting\r\nadventures; but the voyage of 1291, with or without the survival of\r\n1455, is sufficiently remarkable. It is the first direct attempt of\r\nEuropeans in the Middle Ages to find a sea-route to India around Africa;\r\nits far-reaching design contrasts forcibly with the more modest projects\r\nof nearly all similar attempts before Prince Henry's time, and it is not\r\nimprobable that some of its work survived, though officially\r\nunrecognised.[115]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 115: Thus it has been pointed out that two of\r\n    Tedisio Doria's galleys were registered in a legal document of\r\n    1291, under the names of St. Antonio and Allegrancia, and that\r\n    the name Allegranza, applied for some time to one of the\r\n    Canaries, was perhaps derived from this ship. Either from this\r\n    or from Malocello's venture of 1270, the islands of Lançarote\r\n    and Maloxelo in the same group probably took their names.\r\n    Lançarote was marked with the red cross of Genoa on most\r\n    Portolani down to a late period of the sixteenth century.]\r\n\r\nThe Hispano-Italian voyage of 1341 appears to have been solely occupied\r\nwith the exploration of the Canaries, which were now becoming pretty\r\nwell known, and we leave over any further notice of this for the\r\npresent; but the Catalan expedition of 1346 was to some extent similar,\r\nboth in object and method, to the Genoese expedition of 1291. \"The ship\r\nof Jayme Ferrer,\" according to the Catalan Mappemonde of 1375, \"started\r\nfor the River of Gold[116] on St. Lawrence's Day, 1346.\"[117] To the\r\nsame effect the Genoese archives[118] assert \"On the Feast of St.\r\nLawrence there went forth from the city of the Majorcans one galley of\r\nJohn Ferne the Catalan, with intent to go to Rujaura.[119] Of the same\r\nnothing has since been heard.\"[120] And on the Map of 1375 already\r\nnoticed, upon the third sheet, is depicted off Cape Bojador the\r\npicture[121] of the ship in question adjoining the legend above-quoted.\r\nWe may notice, however, that Guinea, the gold land of Africa, and not\r\nIndia, was the objective of this voyage--although Guinea was the first\r\nstep on the African route to India--and that the venture, as Major says,\r\nwas apparently designed only for the discovery of the supposed Negro\r\nriver in which gold was collected: a guess of Mediterranean\r\nmerchants[122] from the information of Moorish middlemen.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 116: _I.e._, Guinea.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 117: 10th August.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 118: See Papers presented to Archives of Genoa by\r\n    Federico Federici, 1660. Reference discovered by Gräberg af\r\n    Hemsö.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 119: The River of Gold.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 120: Yet, proceeds this record, the \"river [of gold]\r\n    is a league wide and deep enough for the largest ship. This is\r\n    the Cape of the end ... of W. Africa.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 121: Nordenskjöld, _Periplus_, p. 114 (1897), gives\r\n    a confirmation from experience. \"There is hardly any doubt\r\n    that the ship-drawing on the Atlas Catalan is in the main\r\n    correct.... Even in my time, Norwegians went out fishing on\r\n    Spitzbergen in large undecked boats, somewhat like that of\r\n    Ferrer.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 122: Such as dealt in Guinea products, especially\r\n    malaguette pepper, at Nismes, Marseilles, and Montpellier.]\r\n\r\nBeginning with the year 1364, the French also claimed to have made\r\nimportant advances along the African coast route. The men of Dieppe, it\r\nis said, repeatedly sailed beyond Cape Verde, and even Sierra Leone, and\r\nfounded settlements on what was afterwards called the La Mina\r\ncoast.[123] These stations, called Petit Paris, Petit Dieppe, etc.,\r\nlasted till 1410, when home troubles caused their abandonment,[124] like\r\nthe temporary evacuation of the French Ivory Coast Settlements after\r\n1870; but during the forty or fifty years of their existence, they\r\ncarried on a regular trade with the Norman ports.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 123: \"The Mine\" of Hakluyt and early English\r\n    geographers.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 124: See the MS. edited by Margry, and given in\r\n    Major's Introduction to his _Life of Henry the Navigator_; the\r\n    _Short History of the Navigation of Jean Prunaut of Rouen_;\r\n    also _La Relation des Costes d'Afrique appelées Guinées_, by\r\n    Sieur Villaut de Bellefond, Paris, 1669; L. Estancelin,\r\n    _Recherches sur les voyages des navigateurs normands_, 1832;\r\n    Père Labat, _Nouvelle rélation de l'Afrique Occidentale_,\r\n    1728; Pierre Margry, _Les Navigations Françaises du XIVme.\r\n    au XVIme. siècle_, 1867. The French claim is fully admitted\r\n    by Nordenskjöld, _Periplus_, 115-6 (1847), but of course\r\n    vigorously denied by the Portuguese, whom Major\r\n    supports.--_Henry Navigator_, Introduction, pp. xxiv-li, and\r\n    text, pp. 117-133.]\r\n\r\nThis tradition admits that it has lost its proofs in the destruction of\r\nthe Admiralty Registers at Dieppe in 1694, but it is possible that some\r\narticles[125] may be discovered dating from this early commerce, which\r\ncan supply fresh evidence. In itself, the Dieppese story is not\r\nimpossible, and we shall see in another section, from the witness of the\r\nMap of 1351 and other portolanos, how plausible it appears, together\r\nwith still greater ventures. But as things at present stand, it must be\r\nconsidered as a \"thing not proven.\"[126]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 125: Especially some of the ivory carvings said to\r\n    have been made from spoils of this fourteenth-century trade.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 126: The \"short history\" of Prunaut's navigation\r\n    assigns September, 1364, for the start of the first voyage;\r\n    makes the sailors reach \"Ovideg\" at Christmas (\"Ovidech\" in\r\n    Barros, _Decade I_, occurs as a native name for the Senegal);\r\n    and tells us the anchorage was at C. \"Bugiador,\" in \"Guinoye.\"\r\n    The blacks, called Jaloffs or Giloffs, had never seen white\r\n    men before. Small presents were exchanged for \"morphi\" or\r\n    ivory, skins, etc. Next year (?) Prunaut (called \"Messire Jean\r\n    of Rouen\" throughout), returned with four ships and acquired\r\n    land from the natives. Here he built houses for wares and\r\n    habitation, and proposed to his men to settle there\r\n    permanently. They agreed, but quarrels prevented the\r\n    foundation of the colony. In September, 1379, Prunaut sailed\r\n    again to Guinea with a very fine ship, _Notre Dame de bon\r\n    Voyage_, but lost many men from sickness; he himself returned\r\n    after Easter, 1380, with much gold. After this Prunaut was\r\n    made a captain in the French navy. Next year (1381) the _Notre\r\n    Dame_ again went out with the _St. Nicholas_ and\r\n    _L'Espérance_, of Dieppe and Rouen. The first-named cast\r\n    anchor at La Mine, where Prunaut built a chapel, a castle, a\r\n    fortalice, and a square house, on a hill called the \"Land of\r\n    the Prunauts.\" Near this were Petit Dieppe, Petit Rouen, Petit\r\n    Paris, Petit Germentrouville; French forts were also built at\r\n    Cormentin and Acra. But from 1410 all this prosperity decayed;\r\n    in eleven years only two ships went to the gold coast, and one\r\n    to the Grande Siest; and soon after the wars in France\r\n    destroyed this commerce altogether.\r\n\r\n    Villaut de Bellesfond, Estancelin, and Labat, narrate the same\r\n    incidents as follows: Charles V encouraged commerce, so in\r\n    November, 1364, the Dieppese fitted out two ships, of 100 tons\r\n    each, for the Canaries. About Christmas they reached C. Verde,\r\n    and anchored before Rio Fresco, which in 1669 was still called\r\n    \"Baie de France.\" Afterwards they went on to a place they\r\n    called \"Petit Dieppe,\" and the Portuguese \"Rio Sestos,\" beyond\r\n    Sierra Leone; for objects of small value they gained gold,\r\n    ivory, and pepper; returning in 1365 they realised great\r\n    wealth; and in September of the same year the merchants of\r\n    Rouen joined with those of Dieppe to fit out four ships, two\r\n    for trade between Cape Verde and Petit Dieppe, the other two\r\n    for exploration of the coast beyond. One of these last stopped\r\n    at Grand Sestere, on the Malaguette coast, and loaded pepper;\r\n    the other ship traded on the Ivory Coast, and went on as far\r\n    as the Gold Coast, and depôts were fixed at Petit Dieppe and\r\n    Grand Sestere, which was re-named Petit Paris. Factories or\r\n    \"Loges\" were established to prepare cargoes for the ships. The\r\n    native languages long retained French words, as was found in\r\n    1660. In 1380 the Company sent out _Notre Dame de bon Voyage_,\r\n    of 150 tons, from Rouen to the Gold Coast (September). At end\r\n    of December they reached the same landing where the French had\r\n    traded fifteen years before. In the summer of 1381 the _Notre\r\n    Dame_ returned to Dieppe richly laden; in 1382 three ships set\r\n    sail together, September 28th, viz, _La Vierge_, _Le Saint\r\n    Nicholas_, _L'Espérance_. _La Vierge_ stopped at La Mine, the\r\n    first place discovered on the Gold Coast. The _St. Nicholas_\r\n    traded at Cape Corse and at Mouré below La Mine, and\r\n    _L'Espérance_ went as far as Akara, trading at Fanting, Sabon\r\n    and Cormentin. Ten months after, the expedition returned with\r\n    rich cargoes. Three more ships were sent out in 1383, one to\r\n    go to Akara, the others to build an outpost at La Mine; there\r\n    they left ten or twelve men, and returned after ten months. A\r\n    church was afterwards built for the new colony, and in 1660\r\n    this still preserved the arms of France. After the accession\r\n    of Charles VI, the African trade was soon ruined. Before 1410\r\n    La Mine was abandoned, and until after 1450 the Normans, it is\r\n    believed, abandoned maritime explorations.]\r\n\r\nReliable evidence of French voyages to the Gold Coast of Guinea can only\r\nbe quoted for the sixteenth century. Thus Braun in 1617, and Dapper some\r\ntime shortly before 1668, inspected buildings and collected traditions\r\nfrom the natives on that shore which alone would prove these later\r\nexpeditions, if they were not confirmed by several documents in Ramusio,\r\nTemporal, and Hakluyt.[127] Equally reliable is the tradition of\r\nBéthencourt's _Conquest of the Canaries_ in 1402, etc.; yet the authors\r\nof this history, Béthencourt's chaplains, give no hint of any knowledge\r\npossessed by their countrymen about the mainland coast beyond Cape\r\nBojador, but rather imply the reverse. Finally, though so many of the\r\nbest sixteenth-century maps are Dieppese, none of these show the\r\nfourteenth-century settlements, which are also wanting in all charts of\r\nthe earlier time. The controverted names are first found on a map of\r\n1631, by Jean Guérand; and this is probably not unconnected with the\r\nfact that in 1626 Rouen and Dieppe united for trade with the Guinea\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 127: See De Bry's _Collection des petits Voyages_,\r\n    Frankfort, 1625; Oliver Dapper's _Description of Africa_ (in\r\n    Dutch), Amsterdam, 1668; Ramusio's _Collection_, Ed. of 1565,\r\n    iii. p. 417 _verso_, in the _Discorso sopra la Nuova Francia_;\r\n    Dr. David Lewis' _Letter to Burleigh_, March 9, 1577.\r\n    Santarem's _Priority of Portuguese Discoveries, etc._ (1842),\r\n    is mainly directed against the French claims.]\r\n\r\nIt is of course possible, as M. d'Avezac long ago argued from the\r\nevidence of the great Portolani of the fourteenth century, especially\r\nthe Laurentian or Medicean[128] of 1351, the Pizzigani[129] of 1367, and\r\nthe Catalan of 1375, that some unrecorded advance was accomplished along\r\nthe African mainland coast during the middle years of this century; the\r\nimperfection of our records must never be forgotten; and we shall return\r\nto this question in another section. But nothing definite and certain\r\ncan be gathered about the coast beyond Cape Bojador, except in a few\r\nsmall points.[130] With the Atlantic islands the case was very\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 128: Genoese.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 129: Venetian.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 130: Unless the contour of the Laurentian Map of\r\n    1351 is held to prove a circumnavigation of Africa shortly\r\n    before 1351. The comparative accuracy of this outline, so\r\n    incredibly good as mere guesswork, must remain one of the\r\n    chief _cruces_ of Mediæval geography.]\r\n\r\nThe expedition[131] (1402-12) of the Sieur de Béthencourt, Lord of\r\nGranville la Teinturière, of the Pays de Caux in Normandy, was chiefly\r\nconcerned with the Canaries[132]--like the voyages of the Spaniards\r\nFrancisco Lopez (1382), and Alvaro Becarra (? 1390, etc.) But, after\r\nachieving fair success in the islands, De Béthencourt attempted\r\n(apparently in 1404) an exploration of the mainland coast \"from Cape\r\nCantin, half way between the Canaries and Spain,\" to Cape \"Bugeder\" or\r\nBojador,[133] the famous promontory to the right or east of the\r\nCanaries. But this was left unfinished; and De Béthencourt's chaplains,\r\nin describing their Seigneur's intentions beyond the \"Bulging Cape,\" can\r\nonly fall back on a certain Book of a Spanish Friar,[134] which\r\nprofessed to give a description of Guinea, and the River of Gold. This\r\nlast was said by the Friar to be 150 leagues from \"the Cape Bugeder,\"\r\nand the French priests declare that \"if things were such as described,\"\r\ntheir lord hoped sometime to reach the said river, \"whereby access would\r\nbe gained to the land of Prester John, whence come so many riches.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 131: See the _Book of the Conquest and Conversion of\r\n    the Canarians by Jean de Béthencourt_, written by Pierre\r\n    Bontier, monk, and Jean le Verrier, priest. Edited for the\r\n    Hakluyt Society by R. H. Major, 1872.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 132: See section of this Introduction on the African\r\n    Islands, pp. lxxxii-lxxxiv.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 133: Buyetder on the Catalan Atlas of 1375.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 134: This is identified by Nordenskjöld, _Periplus_\r\n    79, following Espada, with the recently rediscovered _Libro\r\n    del Conosçimiento de todos los reynos & tierras & señorios que\r\n    son por el mundo & de las señales & armas que han cada tierra\r\n    & señorio por sy & de los reyes & Señores que los proueen_.\r\n    This was lost sight of till 1870, when it was found by Marcos\r\n    Jimenez de la Espada, who published it in the _Boletin de la\r\n    Sociedad Geographica de Madrid_ 1877. \"It is certainly not a\r\n    record of actual travel, but probably the description of an\r\n    imaginary journey, compiled with the help of a richly\r\n    illustrated typical portolano, reports by far-famed and\r\n    travelled men, and such geographical works as were accessible\r\n    to the author. Many names here occurring are, however, not to\r\n    be found on the portolanos of the fourteenth century.... Every\r\n    city or country spoken of in the book has a chapter to itself,\r\n    followed by a representation of the flag or arms of the State.\r\n    These also seem ... taken from some portolano.\" See the\r\n    _Conquest of the Canaries_ (Hakluyt Soc. ed., ch. 55). The\r\n    _Conosçimiento_ cannot well be of later date than 1330-1340.\r\n    In many places it copies Edrisi.]\r\n\r\nThus the French colonists in the early fifteenth century, in Prince\r\nHenry's boyhood, know nothing first-hand, nothing save half-legendary\r\nrumours, about the African coast beyond Cape Bojador. They are anxious\r\nto reach the River of Gold, and traffic there, but they do not know the\r\nway. Of Petit Paris, Petit Dieppe, La Mine, and other Norman settlements\r\nor factories beyond Cape Verde, they give no sign.\r\n\r\nThe late and doubtful[135] tradition of Macham's discovery of Madeira\r\n(_c._ 1350-1370) does not concern the exploration of the African\r\nmainland, except that after the death of the \"discoverer\" in his island,\r\nsome of his sailors were said to have escaped in the ship's boat\r\n(according to the story) to the Continent, to have been made prisoners\r\nby the Berbers, and to have been held in slavery till some of the\r\nsurvivors were ransomed in 1416. But all this, if true, belongs to the\r\nwell-known coast within Cape Non, and in no manner furthered\r\nexploration, except as regarded the island group of Madeira and Porto\r\nSanto.[136]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 135: Admitted by Nordenskjöld with singular\r\n    facility: _Periplus_, pp. 115-6.

These, he says, had been accomplished by a person with\r\nwhom he actually spoke, who claimed to have passed from Sofala to\r\n\"Garbin,\" in the middle of the West coast, as it is marked on Fra\r\nMauro's planisphere. If genuine, they would be the last anticipations of\r\nPrince Henry's enterprises left to chronicle; but few have placed much\r\nconfidence in these statements, which seem indeed incredible in the form\r\nthey are related by the Venetian draughtsman.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 137: See Map section.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ATLANTIC ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nI. BEFORE PRINCE HENRY.\r\n\r\nThe history of the exploration of the Azores, the Canaries, and the\r\nMadeira group, before Prince Henry's time, seems to deserve a special\r\nnotice in this place.\r\n\r\nIt is pretty certain that the Fortunate Islands of ancient geography\r\nwere our Canaries. Eudoxus of Cyzicus was said to have discovered off\r\nthe West African coast an uninhabited island, so well provided with wood\r\nand water, that he intended to return there and settle for the winter.\r\nAccording to Plutarch, Sertorius (B.C. 80-72) is said to have\r\nbeen told by some sailors whom he met at the mouth of the Baetis[138] of\r\ntwo islands[139] in the ocean, from which they had just arrived. These\r\nthey called the \"Atlantic Islands,\" and described as distant from the\r\nshore of Africa 10,000 stadia (1,000 miles), and enjoying a perpetual\r\nsummer. Sertorius wished to fly from his war with the Romans in Spain,\r\nand take refuge in these islands, but his followers would not agree to\r\nthis.[140]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 138: Guadalquivir.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 139: Madeira and Porto Santo(?)]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 140: Plutarch, _Sertorius_, c. 8.]\r\n\r\nLeaving out of serious consideration the Atlantis story in Plato's\r\n_Timaeus_ (which may possibly owe something to early Phœnician and\r\nCarthaginian discoveries among the Atlantic islands), it is noticeable\r\nthat no such Western Ocean lands occur in Strabo (B.C. 30). On the other\r\nhand the Canaries are described by Statius Sebosus, as reported in\r\nPliny[141] (B.C. 30-A.D. 70), and by King Juba the younger of Mauretania\r\n(_fl._ B.C. 1); are laid down under the name of Fortunate Islands by\r\nPtolemy; and are adopted in his reckonings as the Western limit of the\r\nworld. Sebosus mentions Junonia, 750 miles from Gades; near this,\r\nPluvialia and Capraria; and 1,000 miles from Gades, off the South-west\r\ncoast of Mauretania or Marocco, the Fortunatae, Convallis or Invallis,\r\nand Planaria.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 141: Pliny, _Hist. Nat._, vi, 32.]\r\n\r\nJuba[142] again makes five Fortunate Isles: Ombrios, Nivaria, Capraria,\r\nJunonia, and Canaria, all fertile but uninhabited. Large dogs were\r\nfound, however, in the last-named, and two of these had been brought to\r\nJuba himself, who called the island after them. Date-palms also\r\nabounded. Juba also, according to Pliny, discovered the Purple islands\r\n(Purpurariae) off the coast of Mauretania, which have been carelessly\r\nidentified by some with the Madeira group, though wanting the two\r\nessential conditions of Juba's description: (1) producing Orchil; (2)\r\nlying very close to the shore of Mauretania. Lançarote and Fuerteventura\r\nagree with Juba's conditions on these points,[143] but then why are they\r\nmade a separate group from Nivaria, etc., which are undoubtedly the main\r\nbody of the Canaries? Juba's account is the most clear and valuable we\r\nhave from ancient geography, dealing with the Canaries, and is far\r\nbetter than that[144] of the Alexandrian geographer. Ptolemy lays down\r\nthe Fortunate Islands--assuming the Canaries to be meant--incorrectly\r\nboth in latitude and longitude, in a position really corresponding\r\nbetter to that of the Cape Verdes. Hence it has been supposed that he\r\nconfounded the two groups in one; whereas the Cape Verdes, lying out to\r\nsea 300 miles from the Continent, are not likely to have been known,\r\neven in his day. An error in position is so common with Ptolemy that it\r\nis quite unnecessary to be disturbed by it. But he clearly had some\r\ndefinite knowledge that islands existed in the ocean to the west of\r\nAfrica, and in his map he probably reproduces the statements of others,\r\nwithout first-hand information of his own, assigning such a position as\r\nsuited best with his theories. For he not merely brings the southernmost\r\nof the Fortunate Isles down to 11° N. lat., but scatters the group\r\nthrough 5° of latitude, placing the northernmost in latitude, 16° N. His\r\nnames vary much from Juba's, for he gives us six: Canaria, the Isle of\r\nJuno, Pluïtala,[145] Aprositus (the Inaccessible), Caspiria, and\r\nPinturia or Centuria; at the western extremity of these, after the\r\nexample of Marinus, he drew the first meridian of longitude.[146]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 142: Copied by Solinus and many mediæval writers\r\n    (see Pliny, _Hist. Nat._, vi, 31). Juba's work was dedicated\r\n    to Caius Cæsar, B.C. 1, when just about to start on an\r\n    expedition to the East. Ombrios, from its mountain lake, has\r\n    been identified with Palma; Nivaria more easily with Teneriffe\r\n    and Canaria with Grand Canary; Junonia is difficult to fix, as\r\n    we have the statement that a second and smaller island of the\r\n    same name is in its neighbourhood; Capraria is supposed to be\r\n    Ferro. The remaining two of our modern archipelago, Lancarote\r\n    and Fuerteventura, are supposed by some to be the\r\n    \"Purpurariae\" of Juba.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 143: And are therefore accepted as the Purpurariae\r\n    by D'Anville Gossellin, Major, and, with some hesitation, by\r\n    Bunbury.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 144: \"A mere confused jumble of different reports.\"\r\n    Bunbury, _Anc. Geog._ ii, 202.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 145: Perhaps a corruption of Sebosus' Pluvialia.\r\n    \"The Inaccessible\" is possibly Teneriffe. Canaria and the Isle\r\n    of Juno are of course identical with Juba's nomenclature.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 146: Cerne, so important a mark in Hanno's\r\n    _Periplus_, he places in the Ocean 3° from the mainland, in\r\n    clear opposition to the Carthaginian authorities whom some\r\n    have thought he possessed and used. Cerne is in latitude 25°\r\n    40', and east longitude 5° on Ptolemy's map.]\r\n\r\nThe Arabs seem to have lost all definite knowledge of the Atlantic\r\nislands, an impossible possession to a race with such a deep horror of\r\nthe Green Sea of Darkness. Masudi, indeed, tells us a story, already\r\nnoticed, of one Khoshkhash, the young man of Cordova, who some years\r\nbefore the writer's time[147] had sailed off upon the Ocean, and after a\r\nlong interval returned with a rich cargo; but nothing more definite is\r\nsaid about this venture.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 147: _C._ A.D. 950.]\r\n\r\nSome tradition of the Canaries or the Madeira group seems to have been\r\npreserved among Moslem geographers, under the name of Isles of Khaledat,\r\nor Khaledad, but we have only one narrative from the collections of\r\nthese authors which suggests a Musulman visit to the same. This is found\r\nin Edrisi, in its earlier form, and must refer to some time before 1147,\r\nwhen Lisbon finally became a Christian city. It probably belongs to a\r\nyear of the eleventh century, and has perhaps left its impression in the\r\nBrandan legend as put forth in the oldest MS., of about 1070.\r\n\r\nThe Lisbon Wanderers, or Maghrurin, from Moslem Spain, commemorated by\r\nEdrisi and by Ibn-al-Wardi, did not apparently venture to the South of\r\nCape Non, but they seem to have reached the Madeira group as well as the\r\nCanaries. The adventurers were eight in number, all related to one\r\nanother. After eleven days' sail, apparently from Lisbon, they found\r\nthemselves in a sea due[148] West of Spain, where the waters were thick,\r\nof bad smell, and moved by strong currents.[149] Here the weather became\r\nas black as pitch. Fearing for their lives they now turned South, and\r\nafter twelve days sighted an island which they called El Ghanam, the\r\nIsle of Cattle,[150] from the sheep they saw there without any shepherd.\r\nThe flesh of these cattle was too bitter for eating, but they found a\r\nstream of running water and some wild figs. Twelve more days to the\r\nSouth brought them to an island[151] with houses and cultivated fields.\r\nHere they were seized, and carried prisoners to a city on the sea-shore.\r\nAfter three days the King's interpreter, who spoke Arabic, came to them,\r\nand asked them who they were and what they wanted. They replied, they\r\nwere seeking the wonders of the Ocean and its limits. At this the King\r\nlaughed, and said: \"My father once ordered some of his slaves to venture\r\nupon that sea, and after sailing it for a month, they found themselves\r\ndeprived of sun-light and returned without any result.\" The Wanderers\r\nwere kept in prison till a west wind arose, when they were blindfolded\r\nand turned off in a boat. After three days they reached Africa. They\r\nwere put ashore, their hands tied, and left. They were released by the\r\nBerbers,[152] and returned to Spain, when a \"street at the foot of the\r\nhot bath in Lisbon took the name of 'Street of the Wanderers.'\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 148: They started with a full east wind.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 149: Sargasso Sea?]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 150: Madeira?]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 151: One of the Canaries?]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 152: At a point named Asafi or Safi (at the extreme\r\n    south-west of our Marocco), said to have been named after the\r\n    Wanderers' exclamation of dismay: Wa Asafi--\"Alas! my sorrow.\"\r\n    Cf. Edrisi, Climate III, section i (ed. Jaubert, i, 201);\r\n    Climate IV, section i (J., ii, 26-9). Safi is in 32° 20' N.\r\n    Lat.]\r\n\r\nEl Ghanam has been identified by Avezac and others with Legname, the old\r\nItalian name for Madeira, and their description of the \"bitter mutton\"\r\nof that island has suggested to some the \"coquerel\" plant of the\r\nCanaries, which in more recent times gave a similar flavour to the meat\r\nof the animals who browsed upon it.[153]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 153: See Berthelot, _Histoire Naturelle des Iles\r\n    Canariens_.]\r\n\r\nSome have conjectured that the \"White Man's Land\" and \"Great Ireland,\"\r\nwhich the Norsemen of Iceland professed to have seen in 983-4, 999, and\r\n1029, was a name for the Canaries, rather than for any point of America,\r\nbut this appears entirely conjectural--though it is probable enough that\r\nsome of the Vikings in their wanderings may have visited these islands.\r\nIn 1108-9, King Sigurd of Norway meets a Viking fleet in the Straits of\r\nGibraltar (\"Norva Sound\");[154] and in the course of their many attacks\r\non the \"Bluemen\" or Moors of \"Serkland\" (Saracen-land) the Northern\r\nrovers who reached the New World, Greenland, and the White Sea, may well\r\nhave sighted and ravaged the Fortunate Islands of the Atlantic, beyond\r\nCape Non.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 154: \"Saga of King Sigurd\" (in _Heimskringla_), ch.\r\n    vi.]\r\n\r\nNo further reference, even conjectural, to the Atlantic Islands is known\r\nuntil the later thirteenth century, when the Mediæval revival in\r\nChristian lands, finding its expression in the Crusades and in the\r\nAsiatic land-travels of John de Plano Carpini, Simon de St. Quentin,\r\nRubruquis, and the Polos, among others, led to attempts in search of a\r\nmaritime route to India from the Mediterranean ports. The earliest of\r\nthese followed immediately on the return of the elder Polos from Central\r\nAsia (1269).\r\n\r\nIn 1270 the voyage of the Genoese, Lancelot Malocello, already referred\r\nto as a possible reconnaissance on the African coast route to the Far\r\nEast, resulted in a re-discovery of some of the Canaries. At any rate,\r\nhe stayed[155] long enough to build himself a \"castle\" there; and the\r\nrecognition of this island, as well as of the adjoining \"Maloxelo,\" as\r\nGenoese on maps of the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth\r\ncenturies,[156] was probably due to this. During Béthencourt's\r\n\"Conquest,\" some of the followers of his colleague, Gadifer de la Salle,\r\nstored barley, we are told, in an old castle which had been built by\r\nLancelot Maloisel. It has been supposed that Petrarch, writing _c._ 1335\r\nA.D., and referring to the armed Genoese fleet which had penetrated to\r\nthe Canaries a generation before (_a Patrum memoria_), was thinking of\r\nMalocello's venture, but the expression is better suited to the\r\nExpedition of 1291, led by Tedisio Doria and the Vivaldi.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 155: In Lançarote island?]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 156: Cf. especially the _Conosçimiento_ of early\r\n    fourteenth century; the Laurentian Portolano of 1351; the\r\n    Soleri Portolani of 1380 and 1385; the Combitis Portolan of\r\n    early fifteenth century; the so-called Bianco of 1436. On a\r\n    Genoese map of 1455, executed by Bartholomew Pareto, is a more\r\n    explicit legend over against Lançarote Island: \"Lansaroto\r\n    Maroxello Januensis.\" See also the _Conquest of ... Canaries_,\r\n    by De Béthencourt's chaplains, ch. xxxii; and Major's note,\r\n    pp. 55-6 of the Hakluyt Society's edition of this Chronicle.]\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the Portuguese followed up Malocello's visit by\r\nvoyages of their own (besides the well-known venture of 1341) before the\r\nyear 1344,[157] when Don Luis of Spain obtained a grant of the Canaries\r\nfrom the Pope[158] at Avignon (November 15, 1344). This grant conferred\r\non Luis de la Cerda, Count of Talmond, the title of Prince of Fortune,\r\nwith the lordship of the Fortunate Islands, in fief to the Apostolic\r\nSee, and under a tribute of 400 gold florins, to be paid yearly to the\r\nChair of St. Peter. The Pontiff also wrote to various sovereigns, among\r\nothers to the King of Portugal, Affonso IV, recommending the plans of\r\nDon Luis to their support. To this Affonso replied (February 12, 1345),\r\nreminding the Pope that he had already sent expeditions to the Canaries,\r\nand would even now be despatching a greater Armada if it were not for\r\nhis wars with Castille and with the Saracens.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 157: Ships from Portugal (according to Sántarem,\r\n    _Cosmographie_, i, 275, copied by Oliveira Martins, _Filhos de\r\n    D. João_, i, 68), visited the Canaries under Affonso IV,\r\n    between _1331_ and 1344. Perhaps this is only a loose\r\n    reference to the expedition of 1341.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 158: Clement VI. Major, _Prince Henry_, 140, and\r\n    _Conquest of Canaries_ (Hakluyt Soc.), xi, has apparently\r\n    confused matters, giving the date of 1334 (in the Pontificate\r\n    of Benedict XII), and implying a grant by Clement VI.]\r\n\r\nAs early as 1317, King Denis of Portugal secured the Genoese, Emmanuele\r\nPezagno (Pessanha), as hereditary admiral of his fleet. Pezagno and his\r\nsuccessors were to keep the Portuguese navy supplied with twenty Genoese\r\ncaptains experienced in navigation and the earliest Portuguese ventures\r\nwere almost certainly connected with this arrangement.\r\n\r\nThis was shown in the expedition of 1341, which left Portugal for the\r\nCanaries under Genoese pilotage, and quite independently of Don Luis, as\r\nfar as we know. It was composed of two vessels furnished by the King of\r\nPortugal, and a smaller ship, all well-armed, and manned by Florentines,\r\nGenoese, Castilians, Portuguese, and \"other Spaniards.\"[159] They set\r\nout from Lisbon on July 1, 1341; on the fifth(?) day they discovered\r\nland; and in November they returned. They brought home with them four\r\nnatives, many goat and seal skins, dye-wood, bark for staining, red\r\nearth, etc. Nicoloso de Recco, a Genoese, pilot of the expedition,\r\nconsidered these islands nearly 900 miles distant from Seville. The\r\nfirst[160] discovered was supposed to be about 150 miles round; it was\r\nbarren and stony, inhabited by goats and other animals, as well as by\r\nnaked people, absolutely savage. The next[161] visited was larger than\r\nthe former, and contained many natives, most of them nearly naked, but\r\nsome covered with goats' skins. The people had a chief, built houses,\r\nplanted palms and fig trees, and cultivated little gardens with\r\nvegetables. Four men swam out to the ships, and were carried off. The\r\nEuropeans found on the island a sort of temple, with a stone idol, which\r\nwas brought back to Lisbon.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 159: The account that has come down to us is by\r\n    Boccaccio(?) (discovered in 1827 by Sebastiano Ciampi, who\r\n    identified the handwriting), and was professedly compiled from\r\n    letters written to Florence by certain Florentine merchants\r\n    residing in Seville. Among these, \"Angelino del Tegghia dei\r\n    Corbizzi, a cousin of the sons of Gherardino Gianni,\" is\r\n    especially mentioned.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 160: Major conjectures Fuerteventura.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 161: Grand Canary?]\r\n\r\nFrom this island several others were visible--one remarkable for its\r\nlofty trees,[162] another containing excellent wood and water, wild\r\npigeons, falcons, and birds of prey.[163] In the fifth visited were\r\nimmense rocky mountains reaching into the clouds.[164] Eight other\r\nislands were sighted. In all, five of the new-found lands were peopled,\r\nthe rest not. None of the natives had any boats, and there was no good\r\nstore of harbours. On one island was a mountain, which they reckoned as\r\n30,000 feet high, and on its summit a fortress-like rock, with a mast\r\natop of it rigged with a yard and lateen sail--a manifest proof of\r\nenchantment. No wealth was found in any of the islands, and hence\r\nperhaps the venture of 1341 was not followed up by Portugal for many\r\nyears; but it is probable that the results of this year are commemorated\r\nin the delineation of the Fortunate Isles upon the Laurentian Portolano\r\nof 1351.[165]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 162: Major here suggests the pines of Ferro.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 163: Gomera?]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 164: Probably Teneriffe. Palma has also been\r\n    suggested, with less likelihood.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 165: See the section of this Introduction on \"Maps\r\n    and Scientific Geography;\" also Wappäus, _Heinrich der\r\n    Seefahrer_, pp. 174-5.]\r\n\r\nNothing, so far as we know, was done for the further exploration of the\r\nCanaries (after 1341) till 1382, when one Captain Francisco Lopez, while\r\non his way from Seville to Galicia, was driven south by storms, and took\r\nrefuge (June 5th) at the mouth of the Guiniguada, in Grand Canary. Here\r\nhe landed with twelve of his comrades; the strangers were kindly\r\ntreated, and passed seven years among the natives, instructing many in\r\nthe doctrines of Christianity. Suddenly Lopez and his men were accused\r\nof sending into Christian countries a \"bad account\" of the islands, and\r\nwere all massacred. Before dying, they seem to have given one of their\r\nconverts a written \"testament,\" and this was found by the men of Jean de\r\nBéthencourt in 1402.\r\n\r\nApparently, very shortly before the invasion of the latter (? in\r\n1390-5), another Spaniard, Alvaro Becarra, visited the islands,[166] and\r\nit was (according to one authority) from information directly supplied\r\nby him and two French adventurers who accompanied him, that De\r\nBéthencourt was induced to undertake his expedition.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 166: Ayala, _Chronicle of Henry III of Castille_,\r\n    asserts that in 1393, mariners of Biscay, Guipuzcoa, and\r\n    Seville, visited the Canaries, and brought back spoils.\r\n    Teneriffe they called the Isle of Hell (Inferno), from its\r\n    volcano. They also landed on other islands of the group which\r\n    they called Lencastre, Graciosa, Forteventura, Palma, and\r\n    Ferro. See also Martins, _Os Filhos de D. João I_, p. 68.]\r\n\r\nThe Lord of Grainville set out with a body of followers, among whom the\r\nknight Gadifer de la Salle was chief, from Rochelle, on May 1st, 1402.\r\nEight days' sail from Cadiz, he reached Graciosa. Thence he went to\r\nLançarote, where he built a fort called Rubicon. Going on to\r\nFuerteventura, he was hampered by a mutiny among his men, and by lack of\r\nsupplies. He returned to Spain, procured from Henry III of Castille what\r\nhe needed, and reappeared at Lançarote. During his absence, Gadifer,\r\nleft in command, accomplished a partial exploration of Fuerteventura,\r\nGrand Canary, Ferro, Gomera and Palma. The \"King\" of Lançarote was\r\nbaptised on February 20th, 1404; but after this, Gadifer quarrelled with\r\nhis leader and returned to France. All attempts to conquer the Pagans of\r\nGrand Canary were fruitless, and De Béthencourt finally quitted the\r\nislands, appointing his nephew Maciot[167] to be governor in his place\r\nof the four Christian colonies in Palma and Ferro, Lançarote and\r\nFuerteventura.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 167: See Azurara, _Guinea_, c. xcv, lxxix, etc.]\r\n\r\nThe Madeira group are laid down[168] in the _Conosçimiento de todos los\r\nReynos_ of the early fourteenth century, as well as in the Laurentian\r\nPortolano of 1351; in the Soleri Portolani of 1380 and 1385; and in the\r\nCombitis Portolan of about 1410. But in 1555,[169] A. Galvano, in his\r\n_Discoveries of the World_, claimed that an Englishman in the reign of\r\nEdward III(?) was the discoverer. He was copied by Hakluyt in 1589, and\r\nEnglish patriotism has been loath to surrender the tradition.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 168: Under the names of Lecmane, Lolegname, Legnami\r\n    [Madeira, the \"Isle of Wood\"]; Puerto or Porto Santo; and I.\r\n    desierta, deserte, or deserta. The last alone is wanting in\r\n    the Combitis Portolan.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 169: Still earlier in 1508, Valentin Fernandez, a\r\n    printer of Munich, issued the story in a MS., re-discovered in\r\n    this century. Later, in 1660, Francisco Manoel de Mello\r\n    published it in his _Epanaphoras de Varia Historia Portuguesa_\r\n    (_III_), Lisbon, 1660. Mello's account was professedly derived\r\n    from an original narrative by Francisco Alcaforado, a squire\r\n    of Prince Henry, now lost. Fernandez, Galvano, (copied by\r\n    Hakluyt) and Mello, all tell practically the same story, but\r\n    with varying details.]\r\n\r\n\"About this time,\" says Galvano [viz., between 1344 and 1395, the two\r\ndates named immediately before and after this entry], the \"island of\r\nMadeira was discovered by ... [Robert] Macham,[170] who sailing from\r\nEngland, having run away with a woman,[171] was driven by a tempest ...\r\nto that island, and cast ashore in that haven, which is now called\r\nMachico, after ... Macham.\" Here the ship was driven from its moorings;\r\nand, according to one account[172] both lovers died; according to the\r\nolder version, Macham escaped to the African mainland, and was finally\r\nsaved and brought to the King of Castille. His old pilot, Morales, was\r\nsupposed to have guided J. G. Zarco in Prince Henry's rediscovery of\r\nMadeira (1420). Azurara, however, says nothing about Macham; and it has\r\nbeen conjectured, from a document rediscovered in 1894, that the Machico\r\ndistrict of Madeira--whose title, given by the Portuguese in 1420, has\r\noften been quoted as an acknowledgement of Macham's claim--derived its\r\nname from a Portuguese seaman of that name, who was living in 1379, or\r\nfrom one of his relations.[173]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 170: Or Machin, or O'Machin, or as Nordenskjöld,\r\n    _Periplus_, 115, also reads: Mac Kean. N. accepts the whole of\r\n    the Macham story with extraordinary readiness.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 171: Anne d'Arfet, or Dorset.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 172: Mello's.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 173: See J. I. de Brito Rebello, in Supplement to\r\n    _Diario de Noticias_ of Lisbon, published in connection with\r\n    the fifth centenary of Prince Henry's birth, 1894. The\r\n    document referring to Machico is dated April 12th, 1379, and\r\n    by this, King Ferdinand, \"the handsome,\" of Portugal, gives to\r\n    one Machico, \"mestre de sua barcha,\" a house in the Rua Nova\r\n    of Lisbon. This was discovered by Rebello in the Torre do\r\n    Tombo, acting on a hint given by Ernesto do Canton. Before\r\n    this, the Macham story was attacked by Rodriguez d'Azevedo, in\r\n    1873. See the _Saudades da terra_ of Dr. G. Fructuoso, pp.\r\n    348-429.]\r\n\r\nThe Azores, or Western Islands, are also (in part) laid down in the\r\n_Conosçimiento_ above quoted (of about A.D. 1330), and in the Medicean\r\nPortolano of 1351;[174] and when the Infant sent out Gonçalo Cabral[175]\r\nin this direction he was aided, it is said, by an Italian portolano, on\r\nwhich the aforesaid islands were depicted.[176] But no record of any\r\nvoyage thereto earlier than that of Diego de Sevill[177] (1427) has been\r\npreserved; nor did any one before the Prince's time attempt, as far as\r\nis known, the colonisation or complete exploration of the Azores. To\r\nthese, however, like the other Atlantic islands, Nordenskjöld's emphatic\r\nwords[178] apply, as the cartographical evidence requires. To some\r\nextent at least all these groups \"were known ... to skippers long before\r\norganised ... expeditions were sent to them by great feudal lords.\"\r\nAbsolute novelty in geographical discovery is one of the most difficult\r\nthings to prove, and in no field of historical inquiry does the saying\r\nmore often occur to the inquirer: \"Vixere fortes ante Agamemnona,\r\nmulti.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 174: It is not at all certain, as Major assumes\r\n    (_Prince Henry_, 1868, p. 235), that this group was first\r\n    discovered by \"_Portuguese_ vessels under Genoese pilotage.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 175: In 1431, etc.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 176: See Nordenskjöld, _Periplus_, 118 A; also P.\r\n    Amat di S. Filippo, _I veri Scopritori delle isole Azore_,\r\n    Ital. Geog. Soc. Bolletino, 1892.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 177: We learn about the voyage of Sevill from the\r\n    Catalan Map of Gabriel Valsecca, executed between 1434 and\r\n    1439, which (1) gives a very fair representation of several of\r\n    the Azores, under the names: Ylla de Oesels (St. Mary), Ylla\r\n    de Fruydols (St. Michael), Ylla de Inferno (Terceira), Ylla de\r\n    Guatrilla (St. George), Ylla de Sperto (Pico), and another of\r\n    which the name has been effaced: (2) Bears the inscription:\r\n    These islands were found by Diego de Sevill, pilot of the King\r\n    of Portugal, in 1427. [Some have tried to read the MS. date as\r\n    1432 (xxxii for xxvii) but the text is against them]. In the\r\n    Mediceum, or Laurentian Portolano, of 1351, St. Mary and St.\r\n    Michael are laid down as Insule de Cabrera; St. George, Fayal,\r\n    and Pico, as Insule de Ventura sive de Columbis; Terceira (?)\r\n    as Insula de Brazi[l]. On the Catalan Map of 1375, we have San\r\n    Zorzo ( = St. George, \"Jorge\"); I. de la Ventura ( = Fayal);\r\n    Li Columbi ( = Pico); I. di Corvi Marini ( = Corvo); Li Conigi\r\n    ( = Flores). On the so-called Andrea Bianco of 1436 (probably\r\n    a re-edition of a much earlier map), St. Michael appears as\r\n    Cabrera. Corvo and Flores first appear on the Catalan Atlas of\r\n    1375, as far as present knowledge goes.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 178: _Periplus_, 116 A.]\r\n\r\nThe Cape Verdes is the only group of Atlantic Islands as to which we may\r\nbe reasonably sure that the mediæval discovery at least was not made\r\nbefore Prince Henry's lifetime. Here the Infant's claim of priority is\r\nprobably most in danger from Phœnician and Carthaginian sailors;[179]\r\nbut even here the challenge is not very serious, unless we insist on\r\nconsidering as proven a number of pretensions which are almost\r\nimpossible to substantiate.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 179: It is probable that the \"Gorgades\" of the\r\n    Greeks were derived from Phœnician accounts; but it is very\r\n    doubtful whether these represent the Cape Verdes. Ptolemy, as\r\n    we have seen, places the southern extremity of his Fortunate\r\n    Isles much in the true position of Santiago, though extending\r\n    them north through 5 degrees of latitude.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--THE ATLANTIC ISLANDS\r\n\r\nIN PRINCE HENRY'S LIFETIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nAzurara also requires some words of supplement as to the progress of\r\ndiscovery and colonisation among the Atlantic Islands in Prince Henry's\r\nlifetime.[180] And, first, in the Azores. After the first voyages of\r\nDiego de Sevill and Gonçalo Cabral, the latter (according to Cordeiro)\r\nsought unsuccessfully for an island which had been sighted by a runaway\r\nslave from the highest mountain in St. Mary; at last, corrected by the\r\nPrince's map-studies, he found the object of his search on the 8th May,\r\n1444, and named it St. Michael, being the festival of the Apparition of\r\nthe Archangel.[181] The colonisation of this (even more than of other\r\nislands in the group) was impeded by earthquakes, but was nevertheless\r\ncommenced on September 29, 1445. From the number of hawks or kites[182]\r\nfound in St. Michael and St. Mary, the present name now began to\r\nsupersede all others[183] for the Archipelago. The island now called\r\nTerceira,[184] but originally \"The Isle of Jesus Christ,\" was apparently\r\ndiscovered before A.D. 1450, either by Prince Henry's sailors, or by an\r\nexpedition of Flemish mariners or colonists under one Josua van der\r\nBerge, a citizen of Bruges, who claimed the exclusive, honour of this\r\nachievement under date of 1445. Hence, in some Netherland maps and\r\natlases, of later date, the Azores are called The Flemish Islands.[185]\r\nOn the other hand, Cordeiro has printed the Infant's charter of March 2,\r\n1450, to Jacques de Bruges,[186] his servant, giving him the Captaincy\r\nof the Isle of Jesu Christ, because the said Jacques had asked\r\npermission of the Prince to colonise this uninhabited spot. Jacques de\r\nBruges bore all the expenses of this colonisation, and may have been\r\nspecially recommended to Henry by his sister, the Duchess of Burgundy.\r\nHe had married into a noble Portuguese family, and had previously\r\nrendered some services to the Infant.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 180: See Major, _Prince Henry_, pp. 238-245 (Ed. of\r\n    1868), mainly based upon Father Cordeiro's _Historia\r\n    Insulana_, 1717.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 181: Azurara (_Chronicle of Guinea_, c. lxxxiii.)\r\n    says that the Regent, D. Pedro, having a special devotion to\r\n    this saint, and being much interested in the re-discovery of\r\n    the Azores, caused this name to be given. Prince Henry\r\n    afterwards granted the Order of Christ the tithes of St.\r\n    Michael, and one-half of the sugar revenues.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 182: \"Azores\" in Portuguese.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 183: \"Western Islands,\" etc.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 184: \"The Third,\" apparently in order after--1. St.\r\n    Mary (reckoned with the Formigas); 2. St. Michael. Its arms\r\n    were the Saviour on the Cross, and it was probably sighted by\r\n    the Portuguese on some festival of the Redeemer.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 185: \"De Vlaemsche Eylanden.\" So on Amsterdam maps\r\n    of 1612 (Waghenaer); 1627 (Blaeuw's _Zeespiegel_) and others,\r\n    such as the Atlas Major Blaviana, ix, Amsterdam, 1662, p.\r\n    104.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 186: _I.e._, Josua van der Berge. In 1449, according\r\n    to Galvano and Barros (1, ii, 1), King Affonso V formally\r\n    sanctioned the colonisation of the Azores.]\r\n\r\nGraciosa was colonised by Vasco Gil Sodré, a Portuguese, who had been\r\nunder Prince Henry's orders to Africa, and at first intended to join in\r\nthe settlement of Terceira, but afterwards passed over to Graciosa. The\r\ncaptaincy of this island he divided for some time with his\r\nbrother-in-law, Duarte Barreto.\r\n\r\nSan Jorge received its first inhabitants through a venture of Willem van\r\nder Haagen,[187] one of Jacques de Bruges' companions: Van der Haagen\r\nbrought two shiploads of people and plant from Flanders, but afterwards\r\nabandoned the city he had founded there, and transferred himself to the\r\nmore fertile island of Fayal. The last name brings us to one of the\r\ncontroversial points in the early history of the Azores.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 187: \"Da Silveira\" in Portuguese.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the received account, Fayal was first settled by a Fleming\r\nnoble, Jobst Van Heurter,[188] Lord of Moerkerke, father-in-law of\r\nMartin Behaim, who commemorated this event in a legend on his globe of\r\n1492. The famous Nuremberger declares that the Azores were colonised in\r\n1466, after they had been _granted by the King of Portugal to his\r\nsister, Isabel, Duchess of Burgundy_; that in 1490 Job de Huerter came\r\nout to settle with \"some thousands of souls,\" the Duchess \"_having\r\ngranted these islands to him and his descendants_;\" that in 1431, _when\r\nPrince Pedro was Regent_, Prince Henry sent out two vessels for two\r\nyears' sail beyond Finisterre, and sailing west 500 leagues, they found\r\nthese _ten_ uninhabited islands; that they called them Azores from the\r\ntame birds they found there; and that the King began to settle the\r\nislands with \"domestic animals\" in 1432. This account is full of\r\ninaccuracies, and from the documents,[189] noticed by Father Cordeiro,\r\nby Barros, and by the _Archivo dos Açores_, it appears probable that the\r\ngrant of Fayal to Jobst van Heurter as first Captain Donatory was made\r\nafter Prince Henry's death, perhaps in 1466, by Henry's successor, D.\r\nFerdinand, at the request of the Duchess of Burgundy, and that this\r\ngrant was confirmed by the Crown of Portugal; which, however, retained\r\nits sovereign rights over all the Azores, and did not part with them to\r\nthe Duchess or anyone else.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 188: \"Joz de Utra\" in Portuguese.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 189: Several documents exist relating to the\r\n    Government, etc., of the Azores during Prince Henry's life;\r\n    for instance:--(1) A royal charter of July 2, 1439, dealing\r\n    with colonisation. (2) A similar charter of April 5, 1443,\r\n    exempting the colonists from tithe and customs. (3) A similar\r\n    charter of April 20, 1447, establishing the same exemption for\r\n    the island of St. Michael, granted to the Infant D. Pedro. (4)\r\n    A similar charter of March, 1449, to the Infant D. Henry,\r\n    licensing him to people the Seven Islands of the Azores. (5) A\r\n    similar charter of January 20, 1453, granting the Island of\r\n    Corvo to the Duke of Braganza. (6) A donation of September 2,\r\n    1460, from the Infant D. Henry to his adopted son, the Infant\r\n    Dom Fernando, of the Isles of Jesus Christ and Graciosa. [To\r\n    which may be added: A royal charter of December 3, 1460,\r\n    transferring to the Infant D. Fernando, Duke of Viseu, the\r\n    grant of the Archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores, vacant by\r\n    the death of D. Henry.] See _Archivo dos Açores_, i, 3, 5, 6,\r\n    7, 9, 11; Martins, _Os Filhos do D. João_, pp. 261-2 (where\r\n    the date of Gonçalo Velho Cabral's discovery of the Formigas\r\n    is given as 1435); _Documents_ in Torre do Tombo, Gaveta 15,\r\n    Maço 16, No. 5, of September 16, 1571.]\r\n\r\nJobst van Heurter, some time after he had obtained the grant or\r\nsub-lease of Fayal, appears also to have become Captain Donatory of\r\nPico, with a commission to colonise this island.\r\n\r\nFlores and Corvo were first granted, as far as our records go, to a lady\r\nof Lisbon, Maria de Vilhena, likewise after the death of Prince Henry.\r\nIt is said that Van der Haagen,[190] when he moved from S. Jorge to\r\nFayal, did so at the invitation of Jobst van Heurter, who had been there\r\nfour years, and now promised him a part of the island. The two\r\nquarrelled, however, and \"Silveira\" left Fayal and went to Terceira.\r\nSome time after this he visited Flanders, and returning to the Azores by\r\nway of Lisbon, became the guest of D. Vilhena, who had received a grant\r\nof Flores and Corvo. She now proposed to Van der Haagen that he should\r\ncolonise and govern these islands for her, which he did for seven years.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 190: \"Da Silveira.\" See above, p. lxxxix.]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nNext, as to the Cape Verde islands. There is no positive ground for\r\nsupposing that any Europeans discovered or colonised these before Prince\r\nHenry. The ancient Gorgades, Hesperides, and so forth have been\r\nidentified with them by some, but all this remains in the state of\r\nguess-work--guess-work which has no great probability behind it.\r\n\r\nBut as to the discovery of the Cape Verdes in the Infant's lifetime, a\r\ncontroversy exists between the claims of Cadamosto and Diego Gomez,\r\nwhich must be shortly noticed. It is happily beyond controversy that\r\nfive at least of the Archipelago were discovered within the Prince's own\r\n\"period,\" as their names occur in a document of December 3, 1460,\r\nhereafter noticed.\r\n\r\nCadamosto's claim to the discovery of the Cape Verde islands has been\r\ndenied[191] on the following grounds:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 191: _E.g._ By Major, _Prince Henry_, 1868, p.\r\n    286-8, based on Lopes de Lima's _Ensaios sobre a Statistica\r\n    das Possessoẽs portuguezas_, Lisbon, 1844; see Zurla's\r\n    _Dissertazione_ of 1815.]\r\n\r\n1. A mariner sailing from Lagos in early May could not anchor at\r\nSantiago on SS. Philip and James' day (May 1st), as stated by Cadamosto.\r\n\r\n2. Cadamosto drove three days before the wind from Cape Blanco W.N.W. to\r\nBonavista. But this lies 100 miles S.W. of Cape Blanco.\r\n\r\n3. Cadamosto claims to have seen Santiago from Bonavista, which is\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n4. Cadamosto is wrong in speaking of any river in Santiago as a\r\n\"bow-shot wide,\" or of salt and turtles as found in the island.\r\n\r\nTo this it has been replied:\r\n\r\n1. The first point is probably founded on a misprint. As a correction,\r\nd'Avezac[192] has suggested that Santiago was so called because the\r\nexpedition _set out_ on May 1st. It has also been noticed that the\r\nGerman and French versions of Cadamosto's Italian text (which contains\r\nthis mistake) give March and not May as the month of sailing, while the\r\ntranslation in Temporal's _Histoire de l'Afrique_ has July. Once more\r\nthe festival of St. James (July 25th) has been suggested,[193] in\r\nexchange for that of SS. Philip and James. In support of this, the most\r\nlikely alternative to a simple blunder, caused by haste, carelessness,\r\nand lapse of time, it is pointed out that Cadamosto seems to have\r\narrived at the islands during the rainy season; that this season\r\nprevails from mid-June to November; and that the festival of St. James\r\nwould agree with the time required for a voyage from Lagos, even if\r\ncommencing not in March or May, but as late as the beginning of July.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 192: \"Iles d'Afrique\"....]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 193: On the strength of Temporal's text in the\r\n    _Histoire de l'Afrique_,... Lyons, 1556, by H. Y. Oldham,\r\n    _Discovery of Cape Verde Islands_ (paper of 15 pages; see\r\n    especially 9-12).]\r\n\r\nThis date is apparently confirmed by the earliest known official\r\ndocument which relates to the Cape Verde Islands, viz., a decree, dated\r\nDecember 3rd, 1460, issued just after the death of Prince Henry.[194] In\r\nthis is given a list of seventeen islands discovered by the Infant's\r\nexplorers, beginning with the Madeiras and Azores, and ending with five\r\nof the Cape Verdes, S. Jacobe (Santiago), S. Filippe (Fogo), De las\r\nMayaes (Maio), Ilha Lana (Sal?), and S. Christovão (probably Bonavista).\r\nThe only festival of St. Christopher in the Calendar falls on the day of\r\nSt. James, or July 25th. We may notice that in the earliest map\r\ncontaining these islands,[195] Cadamosto's name of Bonavista prevails,\r\nas now, over \"St. Christopher.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 194: See _Indice cronologico das Navigacoẽs ... dos\r\n    Portuguezes_, Lisbon, 1841; Oldham, _op. cit._, pp. 12-13.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 195: The Benincasa of 1463.]\r\n\r\n2. This charge seems founded on a mistranslation. In the original text\r\nof 1507, after a description of the process of putting out to sea from\r\nCape Blanco, we have these words:[196] \"and the following night there\r\narose a strong wind from the south-west, and in order not to turn back\r\nwe steered west and north-west ... so as to weather and hug the wind for\r\ntwo days and three nights.\" That is, the contrary wind met with after\r\nleaving Cape Blanco did not turn the ships back, as they managed to sail\r\nclose to it.[197]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 196: \"E la nocte sequente ne a fazo un temporal de\r\n    garbin cum vento fortevole, diche per non tornar in driedo\r\n    tegnessemo la volta di ponente e maistro salvo el vero per\r\n    riparar e costizar el tempo doe nocte e III zorni.\" Oldham,\r\n    _loc. cit._ 11.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 197: Oldham adds: \"If _nocte sequente_ means, as it\r\n    would seem, the night of the day following that on which Cape\r\n    Blanco was passed, the ships would have had time to reach a\r\n    point from which a West or West-south-west course would lead\r\n    to Bonavista. Moreover, the Latin text gives the wind as\r\n    South.\"]\r\n\r\nIt is probable, however, that the text is corrupt, and it is only too\r\ncommon in records of this time to have mistakes as to points of the\r\ncompass creeping into the record of voyages performed some time before.\r\nIn any case, it is surely not enough to upset the whole of Cadamosto's\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\n3. Here Cadamosto seems to have made no mistake, in his first printed\r\ntext of 1507. The islands have never been properly surveyed, but Prof.\r\nC. Doelter, in his work _Ueber die Kapverden nach dem Rio Grande_\r\n(1884), speaks of seeing Bonavista from the Pico d'Antonio on Santiago,\r\ntogether with all the rest of the group, even the more distant Sal and\r\nSt. Vincent. It is therefore quite probable that Cadamosto's sailors did\r\nsee Santiago from Bonavista, and this feat was certainly possible.\r\n\r\n4. In this once more Cadamosto is clearly right, and the attempt to\r\ndiscredit him ridiculous. Salt is so abundant in the Cape Verdes,\r\nespecially in the western group, that these were at one time called the\r\n\"Salt islands.\" Turtles are also common enough in the rainy season, and\r\nare mentioned by plenty of visitors and residents.[198] Lastly, the\r\nriver in Santiago, \"a bow-shot across,\" does not correspond to any\r\nfresh-water stream found there, but by this expression may be intended\r\nan inlet of the sea, like the Rio d'Ouro of Prince Henry's sailors,\r\nnorth of Arguim. Curiously enough, this very expression--\"a bow-shot\r\nwide\"--is employed by Dapper of the Estuary at Ribeira Grande in\r\nSantiago; while Blaeuw's _Atlas_ (Amsterdam, 1663) speaks of the same\r\npoint in exactly similar terms: \"à son embouchure large d'environ un\r\ntrait d'arc.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 198: See Astley's _Voyages and Travels_, vol. i,\r\n    Book iv, ch. 6.]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThirdly, the attempts of Prince Henry to acquire possession of the\r\nCanaries for Portugal may be noticed. In 1414, Maciot de Béthencourt,\r\nnephew and heir of the famous John, \"Jean le Conquérant,\" having, under\r\nthreat of war from Castille, ceded the islands to Pedro Barba de Campos,\r\nLord of Castro Forte, sailed away to Madeira; and in 1418, according to\r\nsome authorities, he made a sale of the \"Fortunatae\" to Henry of\r\nPortugal. This was not enough for him, as afterwards he made a third\r\nbargain with the Count of Niebla; while meantime Jean de Béthencourt\r\nhimself left his conquests by will to his brother Reynaud. Pedro Barba\r\nde Campos soon parted with his new rights, which passed successively to\r\nFernando Perez of Seville, and the Count of Niebla. But the latter,\r\nthough now uniting in himself all Spanish claims to the islands, did not\r\ncling to them, but made over everything to Guillem de las Casas, who\r\npassed on his rights to Fernam Peraza, his son-in-law. While this\r\ntransference was going on in Castille and in France, Henry, in the name\r\nof Portugal, attempted in 1424 to settle the question by sending out a\r\nfleet under Fernando de Castro, with 2,500 foot and 120 horse. With this\r\nforce he would probably have conquered the Archipelago, in spite of the\r\ncostliness and trouble of the undertaking, if the protests of Castille\r\nhad not led King John I to discourage the scheme and persuade his son to\r\ndefer its execution.\r\n\r\nIn 1445,[199] seven of the Prince's caravels visited the islands,\r\nreceived the submission of the chiefs Bruco and Piste in Gomera (who had\r\nalready experienced the Infant's hospitality and become his \"grateful\r\nservitors\"), and made slave-raids upon the islanders of Palma. Alvaro\r\nGonçalvez de Atayde, João de Castilha, Alvaro Dornellas, Affonso Marta,\r\nand the page Diego Gonçalvez, with many others, took part in this\r\ndescent, which did not altogether spare the friendly Gomerans, and\r\nbrought on the perpetrators the severe rebuke of Prince Henry.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 199: _Al._ 1443. See Azurara, _Guinea_, chs.\r\n    lxviii-lxix.]\r\n\r\nIn 1446, however, he followed up the reconnaissance of 1445 by another\r\nattempt at complete conquest, which also seems to have ended in failure,\r\nthough the account that remains is very inadequate; perhaps in the\r\nfuture it may be supplemented from the disinterred treasures of Spanish\r\ndocumentary collections. We only know that Henry obtained, in 1446, from\r\nthe Regent D. Pedro a charter, giving him the exclusive right to\r\nsanction or forbid all Portuguese voyages to the Canaries; that in 1447\r\nhe conferred the captaincy of Lançarote on Antam Gonçalvez,[200] and\r\nthat Gonçalvez sailed to establish himself there. So far, according to\r\nAzurara; Barros and the Spanish historians would ante-date all these\r\nmeasures of 1446-7 by several years. In 1455 Cadamosto, sailing in the\r\nPortuguese service, visited and described the islands, and in 1466\r\nHenry's heir, D. Fernando, made one more attempt to reclaim the Canaries\r\nfor Portugal. It failed, and in 1479 the islands were finally adjudged\r\nto Spain, or the now united monarchy of Castille and Aragon.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 200: Presumably the same man who \"brought home the\r\n    first captives from Guinea\" in 1441. Cf. Azurara, _Guinea_,\r\n    ch. xcv.]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nFourthly, in the Madeira group, colonisation made progress during the\r\nInfant's lifetime. After the discoveries of 1418-20,[201] Madeira itself\r\nwas divided up under the feudal lordship of John Gonçalvez Zarco and\r\nTristam Vaz Teixeira; the former receiving the captaincy of the northern\r\nhalf with Machico for his chief settlement; the latter obtaining the\r\nsouthern portion, with Funchal as capital, and the Desertas as an\r\nannexe. From the language of the Infant's Charter[202] of September\r\n18th, 1460, this settlement appears to have taken place in 1425, when\r\nthe Prince was 35 years old.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 201: Cadamosto's statement that Porto Santo had been\r\n    found 27 years before his first voyage, has caused some to\r\n    date this journey 1445, instead of 1455, reckoning from\r\n    Zarco's discovery of 1418, and has led others to post-date\r\n    Zarco's discovery by ten years; but the number XXV is no doubt\r\n    a slip for XXXV. This is a very common form of error at this\r\n    period. Thus, in the \"Cabot\" Map of 1544, the year of the\r\n    original Cabotian discovery of North America is given as\r\n    MCCCCXCIIII, instead of MCCCCXCVII, by a (probable)\r\n    malformation of the V, or simple inattention of the\r\n    draughtsman. Also, in Grynaeus we have MCCCCCIV for MCCCCLIV.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 202: Endowing the Order of Christ with the\r\n    Spiritualities of these islands.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Gaspar Fructuoso, Zarco, in clearing a path through the\r\nforests of Madeira, set the woodland on fire, and seven years elapsed\r\nbefore the last traces of the conflagration were extinguished. The seven\r\nyears is, no doubt, an extra touch; but a fire of tremendous severity\r\nmust have taken place, from Cadamosto's account.[203] The whole island,\r\nhe declares, had once been in flames; the colonists only saved their\r\nlives by plunging into the torrents; and Zarco himself had to stand in a\r\nriver-bed for two whole days and nights, with all his family. Yet,\r\naccording to Azurara, so much wood was soon exported from the island to\r\nPortugal, that a change was produced in the housebuilding of Spain:\r\nloftier dwellings were built; and the Roman or Arab style was superseded\r\nby one originating in the new discoveries among the Atlantic Islands.\r\nAlmost all Portugal, Cadamosto tells us in 1455, was now adorned with\r\ntables[204] and other furniture made from the wood of Madeira.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 203: On his visit in 1455.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 204: It has been also suggested, that the wooden\r\n    crosses set up by Henry's orders in new-discovered lands were\r\n    from the material thus provided.]\r\n\r\nIn the settlement of Porto Santo, Bartholemew Perestrello, a gentleman\r\nof the household of Prince Henry's brother, the Infant John, took\r\npart[205] with Zarco and Vaz. Perestrello imported rabbits, which\r\ndestroyed all the colonists' experiments in crops and vegetable\r\nplanting; but receiving the captaincy of the island, he made some profit\r\nfrom breeding goats and exporting dragon's blood. His grant of Porto\r\nSanto, originally for his lifetime only, was extended by decree of\r\nNovember 1st, 1446, to a donation in perpetuity for himself and his\r\ndescendants. On the death of Bartholemew, Prince Henry bestowed the\r\ncaptaincy on his son-in-law, Pedro Correa da Cunha, in trust for the\r\nfirst Governor's son Bartholemew, who was still a minor. Da Cunha later\r\ncontracted with young Bartholemew's mother and uncle--the widow and\r\nbrother of the first grantee--for a sum of money in return for a cession\r\nof his interim rights; and Prince Henry authorised this contract by a\r\ndecree from Lagos (May 17th, 1458), confirmed by King Affonso V at\r\nCintra (August 17th, 1459).\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 205: He accompanied Zarco in the second voyage of\r\n    1420.]\r\n\r\nYoung Bartholemew entered into his governorship in 1473, and it was\r\nformally confirmed to him (15th March, 1473) by Affonso V. It was his\r\nsister, a daughter of the elder Bartholemew, named Felipa Moñiz de\r\nPerestrello, whom Christopher Columbus married in Lisbon; after which he\r\nlived for some time in Porto Santo, enjoying the use of Perestrello's\r\npapers, maps, and instruments.\r\n\r\nBefore many years had passed, Madeira became famous for its corn and\r\nhoney, its sugar cane,[206] and, above all, its wine. The Malvoisie[207]\r\ngrape, introduced from Crete, throve excellently, and at last produced\r\nthe Madeira of commerce. When Cadamosto visited the island, in 1455, he\r\nfound vine culture already advanced, and become the staple industry of\r\nthe colonists, who exported red and white wine annually to Europe, and\r\nfound a market for the vine staves as bows.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 206: Introduced from Sicily.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 207: \"Malmsey,\" or \"Malvasie,\" from Monemvasia or\r\n    Malvasia in the Morea, the original seat of its culture.]\r\n\r\nAs early as 1430[208] the Infant issued a charter, regulating the\r\nsettlement of Madeira; herein Ayres Ferreira (whose children, \"Adam and\r\nEve,\" were the first Europeans born in the island) is mentioned as a\r\ncompanion of Zarco. An early tradition, which has not yet been\r\nsubstantiated, also maintained that Prince Henry instituted family\r\nregisters for his colonists in this group.[209] In 1433 (September\r\n26th), King Duarte, in a charter from Cintra, granted the islands of\r\nMadeira, Porto Santo, and the Desertas to the Infant Henry; and in 1434\r\n(October 26th), the spiritualities of the same were bestowed on the\r\nOrder of Christ.[210] In December, 1452, a contract was made at\r\nAlbufeira between the Infant D. Henry and Diego de Teive, one of his\r\n\"esquires,\" for the construction of a water-mill to aid in the\r\nmanufacture of cane-sugar,[211] the third part of the produce to go to\r\nthe Prince. Finally, in 1455, on Cadamosto's visit, the island possessed\r\nfour settlements and 800 inhabitants, and this prosperity seems to have\r\nsteadily continued. The charter of 1460[212] has been already noticed.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 208: See Cordeiro, _Historia Insulana_, Bk. III, ch.\r\n    XV.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 209: The late Count de Rilvas communicated this fact\r\n    to Mr. R. H. Major.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 210: _Documentos ... do Torre do Tombo_, p. 2.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 211: See Gaspar Fructuoso, _Saudades da terra_, ed.\r\n    Azevedo (1873), pp. 65, 113, 665; Martins, _Os Filhos de D.\r\n    João_, pp. 80 and _n._ 1, 258 and _n._ 2.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 212: This was issued on September 18th, 1460,\r\n    bestowing the ecclesiastical revenues of Porto Santo and\r\n    Madeira on the Order of Christ, the temporalities on King\r\n    Affonso V. and his successors. It must be taken in connection\r\n    with the Charters of June 7th, 1454, December 28th, 1458, and\r\n    September 15th, 1448, all relating to the trade of Guinea, and\r\n    the first two conferring special privileges on the Order of\r\n    Christ, or revising such privileges already granted; see the\r\n    _Collection_ of Pedro Alvarez, Part III, fols. 17-18; Major,\r\n    _Prince Henry_, 303.]\r\n\r\nFrom the work of the Portuguese among the Atlantic Islands arises one\r\nquestion of special interest. Did this westward enterprise of Prince\r\nHenry's seamen, which undoubtedly carried them in the Azores and Cape\r\nVerdes a great distance (from 20 to 22 degrees) westward of Portugal,\r\nlead them on further to a discovery of any part of the American\r\nmainland?\r\n\r\nOn the strength of an enigmatical inscription in the 1448 Map of Andrea\r\nBianco, such a discovery of the north-east corner of Brazil in or before\r\nthis year has been suggested;[213] but this, it must be admitted, is\r\nquite lacking in demonstrative evidence, however possible in itself. Yet\r\nonce more, the \"accidental\" discovery of this same Land of the Holy\r\nCross by Cabral in 1500 has been urged to much the same effect. For, if\r\nreally accidental, a similar event might well have happened in earlier\r\nyears--especially from the time of the Azores settlement of 1432, etc.;\r\nor if not accidental, it was based on information obtained from older\r\nnavigators, who reached the same country.[214] Such older navigators\r\ntowards the west were said to have been Diego de Teive and Pedro\r\nVelasco, who in 1452 claimed to have sailed more than 150 leagues west\r\nof Fayal; Gonçalo Fernandez de Tavira, who in 1462 sailed (in one\r\ntradition) W.N.W. of Madeira and the Canaries; Ruy Gonçalvez de Camara,\r\nwho in 1473 tried to discover land west of the Cape Verdes; with a\r\ncertain number of later instances. Some weight has also been attached to\r\na statement of Las Casas, that on his third voyage, in 1498, Columbus\r\nplanned a southern journey from the Cape Verde Islands in search of\r\nlands--especially because, proceeds Las Casas, \"he wished to see what\r\nwas the meaning of King John of Portugal, when he said there was _terra\r\nfirma_ to the South. Some of the ... inhabitants of ... Santiago came to\r\n... him,[215] and said that to the South-West of the Isle of Fogo[216]\r\nan island was seen, and that King John wished to make discoveries\r\ntowards the South-West, and that canoes had been known to go from the\r\nGuinea coast to the West with merchandise.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 213: The inscription apparently runs \"Isola\r\n    Otinticha xe longa a ponente 1500 mia;\" which has been\r\n    translated--(1) \"Genuine island distant 1,500 miles to the\r\n    west.\" (2) \"Genuine island, 1,500 miles long to the west.\" (3)\r\n    \"Genuine island extends 1,500 miles to the west.\" Also,\r\n    reading ... a [= e] la sola otinticha. (4) \"Is the only\r\n    genuine ...\" (The first line being altogether separate in\r\n    sense from what follows--\"xe longa,\" etc.) Once more,\r\n    supplying \"questa carta,\" (5) \"This map is the only genuine\r\n    one,\" leaving the second line unintelligible. (6) \"Genuine\r\n    island, stretching 1,500 miles westwards, ten miles broad.\"\r\n    And lastly, reading Antillia for Otinticha, (7) \"Island of\r\n    Antillia,\" etc. (This would explain the difficulty of the\r\n    Antillia Isle being otherwise absent from the 1448 Bianco.)\r\n    See Desimoni, in _Atti della Società ligure di Storia patria_,\r\n    1864, vol. iii, p. cxiv; Canale, in _Storia del Commercio\r\n    degl'Italiani_, 1866, p. 455; Fischer, _Sammlung ... Welt- und\r\n    See-Karten italienischen Ursprungs_, Venice, 1886, p. 209;\r\n    _Proceedings R. G. S._, London, March 1895, pp. 221-240.\r\n    Whatever the explanation, it must be remembered that this Map\r\n    and Inscription were never produced by Portugal as evidence of\r\n    a Pre-Columbian discovery, either in 1492-3, or later, in\r\n    formal negotiations with Spain--as at Badajoz in 1524. It is\r\n    possible that the delineation and legend in question were\r\n    added by a later hand; and it is probable that, if really\r\n    inserted by Bianco himself, the reference is to one of the\r\n    legendary Atlantic Islands under a new form. It cannot well be\r\n    identified with that stated by Galvano to have been discovered\r\n    about 1447, for the latter was reached by a course of 1,500\r\n    miles due west from the Straits of Gibraltar, which would\r\n    bring us to the Azores. The coast line of the \"Genuine Island\"\r\n    is, moreover, quite inconsistent with the north-east\r\n    shore-land of South America.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 214: The most singular point in this controversy is\r\n    that the pilots of Cabral's fleet professed to recognise the\r\n    new land as the same they had seen marked on an old map\r\n    existing in Portugal. This is stated by one John, \"Bachelor in\r\n    Arts and Medicine, and Physician and Cosmographer to King\r\n    Emanuel.\" He accompanied the expedition of 1500, and declared\r\n    that the country where Cabral landed was identical with a\r\n    tract marked upon a Mappemonde belonging to Pero Vaz Bisagudo,\r\n    a Portuguese.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 215: Columbus.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 216: In the Cape Verdes.]\r\n\r\nFurther, Antonio Galvano, after speaking of a voyage which took place in\r\n1447, goes on to mention another (undated, but probably conceived by the\r\nauthor as falling within a year or two of the last) in these terms. \"It\r\nis moreover told that in the meantime a Portuguese ship, coming out of\r\nthe Straits of Gibraltar, was carried westwards by a storm much further\r\nthan was intended, and arrived at an island where there were seven\r\ncities, and people who spoke our language.\" This, however, is too much\r\nlike an echo of the old Spanish tale of the Seven Bishops and their\r\ncities in the Island of \"Antillia.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same connection a number of still looser and more doubtful\r\nassertions exist in Portuguese archives and chronicles. Thus, in 1457,\r\nthe Infant D. Fernando, as heir of Prince Henry, planned Atlantic\r\nexplorations; in 1484 and 1486 similar designs were\r\nentertained--possibly on the strength of Columbus' recent suggestions,\r\nwhich are known to have directly occasioned one unsuccessful venture at\r\nthis time; and in 1473 João Vaz da Costa Cortereal was reported, by a\r\nnow-exploded legend, to have actually discovered Newfoundland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"SCHOOL OF SAGRES,\" ETC.\r\n\r\nFew things in connection with the life of Henry the Navigator are more\r\ninteresting than the tradition of his educational and intellectual work,\r\nespecially for the furtherance of geography, in the alleged School of\r\nSagres and other supposed foundations or benefactions. Unfortunately,\r\nthis tradition is not as clearly established as it might be, and it has\r\nbeen made more difficult by constant exaggeration. Not content with\r\nasserting that the Infant aimed at drawing the commerce of Cadiz and\r\nCeuta--without reckoning other ports--to his town at Sagres, some have\r\nindulged in pictures of a geographical university established by the\r\nPrince upon this headland--pictures which are quite beyond any known\r\nmeans of verification. These flourishes, however, need not cause one to\r\nrun into another extreme, and deny that Sagres became, during the latter\r\npart of Henry's life, especially from 1438 to his death, the centre of\r\nthe exploring movement and the scientific study which the Infant\r\ninspired. At Sagres,[217] according to what may be called the older\r\nview--which, resting mainly upon Barros, is adopted by Major, de Veer,\r\nWauwermans, and even Martins--Prince Henry usually resided, not merely\r\nduring the last years of his life, or after his return from the Tangier\r\nexpedition of 1437, but from the time of his reappearance in Portugal\r\nafter the relief of Ceuta in 1418. At first, however (1418-1438) it was\r\ncalled Tercena[218] Nabal, or Naval Arsenal, after it emerged from the\r\nstage of a little harbour of refuge for passing ships; and only\r\nafterwards did it become (from 1438 onwards) the Villa do Iffante, \"my\r\ntown,\" from which some of Prince Henry's charters are dated. Shortly\r\nbefore the completion of Azurara's chronicle, according to this view,\r\nthe town was fortified with strong walls and enlarged by the building of\r\nnew houses.[219] In this settlement (within the narrow space of some 100\r\nacres), there were said to have been, besides the Infant's own Court or\r\npalace, a church, a chapel,[220] a study, and an observatory (the\r\nearliest in Portugal), together with an arsenal, a dockyard, and a fort.\r\nHere cartography and astronomical geography were diligently studied, and\r\npractical mariners were equipped for their work.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 217: See Azurara, _Guinea_, iv; Barros, _Asia_,\r\n    Decade I, i, 16.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 218: From the Venetian _Darcena_; see Goes, _Chron.\r\n    do pr. D. João IV_; O. Martins, _Filhos de D. João I_, p. 75.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 219: It retained its importance till the Prince's\r\n    death, when it gradually declined; it was sacked by Drake in\r\n    1597; and ruined by earthquakes. Finally it became again as\r\n    deserted as before the Infant's time. Ferdinand Denis believed\r\n    that before the Lisbon earthquake of 1755 there were traces of\r\n    a much earlier habitation of the Sagres Promontory, including\r\n    buildings (Moorish?) at least as old as the XIth century. The\r\n    headland measures only one kilometre in circuit, half a\r\n    kilometre in its extreme length.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 220: Prince Henry's will refers to the Church of St.\r\n    Catherine, and the Chapel of St. Mary; see the _MS.\r\n    Collection_ of Pedro Alvarez, iii; Martins, _Os Filhos de D.\r\n    João_, p. 74. The observatory was not on Sagres Cape proper,\r\n    but \"un peu en avant quand on vient de l'Ouest\" (V. St.\r\n    Martin).]\r\n\r\nTwo original statements of Portuguese authors have been often quoted to\r\nsupport this tradition. The first comes from John de Barros, the Livy of\r\nPortugal (A.D. 1496-1570). \"In his wish to gain a prosperous result from\r\nhis efforts, the Prince devoted great industry and thought to the\r\nmatter, and at great expense procured the aid of one Master Jacome[221]\r\nfrom Majorca, a man skilled in the art of navigation and in the making\r\nof maps and instruments, who was sent for, with certain of the Arab and\r\nJewish mathematicians, to instruct the Portuguese officers in that\r\nscience.\" Secondly, we have the statement of the mathematician Pedro\r\nNuñes, that the Infant's mariners were \"well taught and provided with\r\ninstruments and rules of astrology and geometry which all map-makers\r\nshould know.\"[222] On the other hand, it has been contended that there\r\nis no satisfactory evidence of the Infant's town having ever been\r\nfinished, or of the Prince ever having lived there continuously, except\r\nduring the last years of his life; and that our best authorities do not\r\nwarrant us in believing that the settlement was even begun before the\r\nTangier expedition. Henry's earlier charters are, with one exception,\r\ndated from other places, and his residence before 1438 seems to have\r\nbeen usually at Lisbon, Lagos, or Reposeira. Further, we have no right\r\nto speak of the \"School,\" or \"University,\" or \"Academy\" of Sagres; there\r\nmay have been both teachers and learners, but there was nothing of an\r\n\"institution for instruction\" in the Prince's establishment.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 221: Jacob or James, who, according to one\r\n    tradition, came to the Infant's \"Court\" shortly after the\r\n    disaster of Tangier, in or about 1438. To this name the\r\n    Viscount de Juromenha in his notes to Rackzynski, _Les Arts en\r\n    Portugal_, 205, adds that of Master Peter, the cartographic\r\n    artist of the Infant, who illuminated his maps in colours and\r\n    adorned them with legends and pictures. The existence of this\r\n    Peter rests upon a document at Batalha discovered by\r\n    Juromenha. See also O. Martins, _Filhos de D. João I_, p. 73.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 222: Wauwermans, _Henri le Navigateur et l'Academie\r\n    Portugaise de Sagres_, gives little or no help towards the\r\n    controverted question which he assumes as settled in his\r\n    title. It is a general essay on the course of\r\n    fifteenth-century exploration; its most useful portions are\r\n    devoted to tracing the connections between geographical study\r\n    in Portugal and the Netherlands.]\r\n\r\nSuch is the minimising view; and most, in face of this sharp divergence,\r\nwill agree with Baron Nordenskjöld that a really critical study of the\r\nsubject, especially from a local antiquarian, is desirable. Very\r\nplausibly does Nordenskjöld himself sum up the probabilities of the case\r\nwhen he concludes that \"a small school of navigation, important for the\r\nperiod in question, has probably received from laudatory biographers the\r\nname of an 'Academy.'\"[223] The Swedish geographer, however, adds from\r\nhis own special researches some important observations. He believes that\r\nin the La Cosa map of 1500[224] we have work which was based upon the\r\nobservations of the Infant's captains, who, as shown in these results,\r\nwere evidently able to keep reliable reckoning and take fairly correct\r\naltitudes. \"Further, the extension of the normal or typical portolano\r\nalong the West coast of Africa, as on the portolanos of Benincasa and\r\nothers of the latter part of the fifteenth century, is shown by the\r\nlegends of the same to have been based on observations made during the\r\nmarine expeditions of Prince Henry.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 223: Nordenskjöld, _Periplus_, 121 A.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 224: Plates xliii and xliv of Nordenskjöld's\r\n    _Periplus_.]\r\n\r\nNo charts or other productions of the \"Sagres School,\" in any definite\r\nsense of this term, no geographical or astronomical works emanating from\r\nthe \"Court\" of the Infant, are now extant. But it may reasonably be\r\ninferred from passages in Azurara's _Chronicle of Guinea_ that such\r\ncharts were not only draughted under the Prince's orders, but used by\r\nhis sailors;[225] Cadamosto tells us of the chart he kept on his voyage\r\nof 1455, probably by direction of the Infant; while it is probably true\r\nthat the \"extension of the portolanos beyond Cape Bojador, in\r\nBenincasa,[226] for instance, as well as in Fra Mauro's work of 1457-9,\r\ndepended on information given by native and foreign skippers\" sent out\r\nby Henry. Of course, it is obvious, in the light of present knowledge,\r\nthat neither he nor his school in any sense invented the portolano type;\r\nalthough the mention of Master Jacome of Majorca reminds us of one of\r\nthe earliest centres of the new scientific cartography[227] (which was\r\nprobably first made effective by Catalan skippers and draughtsmen), and\r\nsuggests that the Infant was in touch with the best map-science of the\r\ntime. \"Neither is it correct to say that he introduced hydrographic\r\nplane charts or map graduation in accordance with geographical\r\nco-ordinates.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 225: See Azurara, _Guinea_, ch. lxxviii;\r\n    Nordenskjöld, _Periplus_, 121; Santarem, _Essai sur\r\n    Cosmographie_, vol. iii, p. lix. Affonso Cerveira, Azurara's\r\n    predecessor, was probably not a \"pupil\" of the \"Sagres\r\n    School,\" as some have supposed.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 226: Especially in his works of 1467-8 and 1471.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 227: In the Balearic isles. See pp. cxvii-cxix of\r\n    this Introduction.]\r\n\r\nBut his life was almost certainly not without direct influence in the\r\nimprovement of cartography, and the extension of the scientific type of\r\nmap beyond its fourteenth-century limits--an improvement which we see in\r\nthe great map of Fra Mauro executed shortly before the Infant's death.\r\nAlso, he made his nation take a real interest in geographical discovery,\r\nbroke down their superstitious fear of ocean sailing, and made a\r\nbeginning in the circumnavigation of Africa. He altered the conditions\r\nof maritime exploration by giving permanence, organisation, and\r\ngovernmental support to a movement which had up to this time proved\r\ndisappointing for lack of these very means. And he certainly improved\r\nthe art of shipbuilding, which Cadamosto remarks upon as having rendered\r\nthe caravels of Portugal the best sailing ships afloat.\r\n\r\nAs to the build of these caravels we are fortunately not without data.\r\nCadamosto, indeed, though he describes them as the best sailing ships at\r\nsea in his time, does not give any details; but from other sources[228]\r\nit is possible to form some idea of their peculiar features. They were\r\nusually 20-30 metres long, 6-8 metres in breadth; were equipped with\r\nthree masts, without rigging-tops, or yards; and had lateen sails\r\nstretched upon long oblique poles, hanging suspended from the masthead.\r\nThese \"winged arms,\" when their triangular sails were once spread,\r\ngrazed the gunwale of the caravel, the points bending in the air\r\naccording to the direction of the wind. They usually ran with all their\r\nsail, turning by means of it, and sailing straight upon a bow-line,\r\ndriving before the wind. When they wished to change their course, it was\r\nenough to trim the sails.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 228: See Osorio, _Vida e feitos d'el rei D. Manoel_,\r\n    i, p. 193; O. Martins, _Os Filhos de D. João I_, p. 75;\r\n    Candido Correa, _Official Catalogue of the Naval Exposition of\r\n    1888 in Portugal_, where was exhibited a facsimile of an old\r\n    caravel; see also the plans in D. Pacheco Pereira's\r\n    _Esmeraldo_, and the article in the _Revista Portuguesa\r\n    Colonial_, May 20th, 1898, pp. 32-52. In the last-named study,\r\n    which is specially worthy of notice, we have a detailed\r\n    account of (1) the _Barca_, (2) the _Barinel_, (3) the\r\n    _Caravel_, (4) the _Nau_, which are classed as _navios dos\r\n    descobrimentos_, followed by the _navios dos conquistas_,\r\n    viz., (5) the _Fusta_, (6) the _Catur_, (7) the _Almadia de\r\n    Cathuri_, (8) the _Galé_, (9) the _Galiota_, (10) the\r\n    _Brigantim_, (11) the _Galeaça_, (12) the _Taforea_, (13) the\r\n    _Galeão_, (14) the _Carraca_.

Before the end of the year 1446,\r\naccording to Azurara's estimate, the Infant had sent out fifty-one of\r\nthese ships along the mainland coast of Africa, and they had passed 450\r\nleagues[229] beyond Cape Bojador, which before the Prince's time was the\r\nfurthest point \"clearly known on the coast of the Great Sea.\" Also, the\r\nwork of the \"School of Sagres\" may perhaps be recognised in Azurara's\r\nfurther claim that \"what had before been laid down on the\r\nMappemonde was not certain, but only by guesswork,\" whereas now\r\nit was \"all from the survey by the eyes of our seamen,\" and that \"all\r\nthis coast towards the South with many points our prince commanded to\r\nadd to the sailing chart.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 229: Azurara, _Guinea_, ch. lxxviii.]\r\n\r\nIt has been noticed that D. Pedro, according to the Portuguese\r\ntradition, presented Henry with a copy of Marco Polo's travels, and a\r\nmap of the same, either drawn by the explorer himself or by one who knew\r\nhis works, and belonged to his own city. Thereby, we are told, the work\r\nof the Infant was much furthered, and Galvano suggests that the same was\r\nextant in 1528, and that it contained many wonderful anticipations of\r\nlater discoveries.[230]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 230: \"... Venice ... whence he [Pedro] brought a map\r\n    which had all the circuit of the world described. The Strait\r\n    of Magellan was called the Dragon's Tail; and there were also\r\n    the Cape of Good Hope and the coast of Africa.... Francisco de\r\n    Sousa Tavarez told me that in the year 1528, the Infant D.\r\n    Fernando showed him a map which had been found in the Cartorio\r\n    of Alcobaça, which had been made more than 120 years before,\r\n    the which contained all the navigation of India with the Cape\r\n    of Good Hope.\"--Galvano, _Discovery of World, sub ann._ 1428.]\r\n\r\nIt has also been surmised, without any certain evidence,[231] that D.\r\nPedro presented his brother with various maps of Gabriel Valsecca,[232]\r\nand with the writings of Georg Purbach, the instructor of Regiomontanus.\r\nMuch more certain and interesting is the allusion to the Infant's\r\ncollection of old maps in the history of the discovery of St. Michael\r\n(1443-4) in the Azores. A runaway slave, having escaped to the highest\r\npeak in the Isle of St. Maria, sighted a distant land, and returned to\r\nhis master to gain pardon with this news. Prince Henry was informed of\r\nthis, consulted his ancient charts, and found them confirm the slave's\r\ndiscovery. So he sent out Gonçalo Velho Cabral to seek for the same.\r\nCabral failed; but on his returning to the Prince, the latter showed him\r\nfrom the ancient maps how he had only missed it by a slight error of\r\ndirection. On his second trial the explorer was successful, and reached\r\nSt. Michael on May 8, 1444.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 231: But see Gaspar Fructuoso, _Saudades da terra_\r\n    (ed.

This map of\r\n    Valsecca's only gives St. Mary and the Formigas as known in\r\n    1439; see pp. cxxxi, cxxxiv of this Introduction.]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nPrince Henry's connection with the Coimbra-Lisbon University (founded by\r\nKing Dinis in 1300) opens another side of the same question. We have\r\nalready mentioned the tradition that in 1431 the Infant provided new\r\nquarters in the parish of St. Thomas, in Lisbon, for the teachers and\r\nstudents, and afterwards established Chairs of Theology and Mathematics.\r\nThis has been called by some a \"Reform of Ancient Schools\" under his\r\ninfluence and direction;[233] and recent enquiry[234] has endeavoured to\r\nprove that the Protector of Portuguese Studies was also the founder (in\r\n1431) of a Chair of Medicine, and the donor of a room or lecture-hall in\r\nwhich was painted by his order a picture of Galen. In 1448 the Infant\r\nsubsidised the Chair of Theology by a grant of twelve marks of silver\r\nannually from the revenues of Madeira.[235] It is perhaps noteworthy\r\nthat the Prince does not appear to have founded any lectureship, or made\r\nany benefaction to promote directly the study of geography, though\r\nancient texts bearing on this subject were now beginning to attract\r\nconsiderable attention. It may be open to question how far a university\r\nwould then have welcomed an instructor in practical navigation or\r\ndraughtsmanship; but students would have probably listened to lectures\r\nupon Ptolemy, or Strabo, or other classical geographers, and thereby a\r\ngreat impetus might have been given to the new exploring spirit. Thus in\r\ngeneral we may fairly conclude that, so far as the Portuguese seamen of\r\nthe next generation, Bartholemew Diaz, Da Gama, Cão, and others,\r\n\"received their training from the Infant's School,\" it was usually\r\nthrough a rougher and more practical tradition than that of a\r\nclass-room--by means of older mariners who had served in the Prince's\r\nships rather than by university lecturers whom he had appointed.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 233: See O. Martins, _Filhos de D. João I_, pp.\r\n    63-4.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 234: Cf. Max. Lemos, _A medicina em Portugal_,\r\n    1881.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 235: J. S. Ribeiro, _Historia dos estabel.\r\n    scientific, litt. e art. de Portugal_, i, p. 31.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAPS AND SCIENTIFIC GEOGRAPHY UP TO AND DURING PRINCE HENRY'S LIFE.\r\n\r\nAncient maps were not without high merits in certain cases, and a little\r\nafter Prince Henry's time the Renaissance editions of Ptolemy played a\r\nvery important part in geographical history. But in the first part of\r\nthe fifteenth century neither the work of the Alexandrian astronomer and\r\ncartographer, nor the ancient road maps of the Roman Empire and\r\nsurrounding lands[236] seem to have been sufficiently known for the\r\nexercise of much influence in the progress of discovery or of\r\ngeographical knowledge. The same result follows, for different reasons,\r\nin the case of almost all the earlier mediæval maps and charts,[237]\r\nwhich are quite unscientific in character, and often rather picture\r\nbooks of natural history legends than delineations of the world.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 236: _E.g._, the Peutinger Table.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 237: Viz., before the end of the thirteenth century;\r\n    see _Dawn of Modern Geography_, ch. vi, on \"Geographical\r\n    Theory in the Earlier Middle Ages,\" and especially pp.\r\n    273-284, 327-340, 375-391.]\r\n\r\nStrictly scientific map-making begins with the Mediterranean portolani.\r\nThe earliest existing specimen of these is of about 1300, but the type\r\nthen formed[238] must have been for some time in process of elaboration;\r\nand it is even probable that a fully-developed example from the middle\r\nof the thirteenth century may yet be discovered.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 238: _E.g._, in the Carte Pisane and the work of\r\n    Giovann de Carignano.]\r\n\r\n\"A sea-chart--probably a portolano--is mentioned as early as the account\r\nof the Crusade of St. Louis, in 1270.\"[239] So in Raymond Lulli's _Arbor\r\nScientiæ_, written about 1300, we have reference to compass, chart and\r\nneedle, as necessary for sailors.[240] Once again, it is probable that\r\nAndrea Bianco's planisphere of 1436[241] is only a re-edition of a\r\nthirteenth-century work, when the \"Normal Portolano\" was just in process\r\nof making, but had not reached even the comparative perfection of the\r\nCarte Pisane, Carignano, or Vesconte examples.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 239: See d'Avezac, _Bolletino d. Soc. Geog. Ital._,\r\n    1874, p. 408; Nordenskjöld, _Periplus_, 16 A.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 240: See d'Avezac, _Coup d'œil historique sur la\r\n    projection des Cartes de Geographie_ (1863), p. 38.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 241: Reproduced in part at the end of this edition\r\n    of _Azurara_, vol. i, Plate 4.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest dated portolan is that of 1311, by Petrus Vesconte; and\r\nfrom this time the maps of this class, whose central feature is an\r\naccurate Mediterranean coast-line, increase rapidly, being indeed all\r\nreproductions of one type,[242] occasionally introducing additions or\r\ncorrections, especially in outlying parts, but not often varying much\r\nfrom one another in the central portions. The type is reasonably\r\nbelieved by some[243] to have originated among the Catalans, either of\r\nSpain, France, or the Balearic Isles, well within the thirteenth\r\ncentury.[244] In connection with this, we may recall the point mentioned\r\nby Barros, that Prince Henry the Navigator obtained the services of\r\nMaster Jacome, or James, from Majorca to instruct the Portuguese\r\ncaptains in navigation, map-making, and the proper handling of nautical\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 242: Thus Nordenskjöld sums up after an exhaustive\r\n    review of all the chief early portolans: \"Not only are the\r\n    coast-legends the same, even the ... names in red ink of\r\n    places considered of special importance to navigators were not\r\n    essentially different in the three centuries from Vesconte to\r\n    Voltius. Moreover: (1) The Mediterranean and Black Sea have\r\n    exactly the same shape on all these maps; (2) a\r\n    distance-scale, with the same unit of length, such as\r\n    otherwise is used only on the Spanish and French Mediterranean\r\n    coasts, occurs on all these maps, independently of the land of\r\n    their origin; (3) the distances across the Mediterranean and\r\n    Black Sea, measured with this scale, agree perfectly on the\r\n    islands and capes remain almost unaltered on portolanos from\r\n    the fourteenth to the sixteenth century. So that it may be\r\n    thought proved that all these portolanos are only amended\r\n    codices of the same original\" (_Periplus_, 45 A).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 243: _E.g._, Nordenskjöld, in his last work\r\n    (_Periplus_, 46, 47).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 244: Nordenskjöld conjectures probably between 1266\r\n    and 1300.]\r\n\r\nThese plans of practical seamen are a striking contrast, in their often\r\nmodern accuracy, to the results of the literary or theological geography\r\nportrayed in such works as those of the \"Beatus School,\" or of Robert of\r\nHaldingham.[245] Map surveys of this kind were apparently unknown to the\r\nancient world. The old _Peripli_ were sailing directions, not drawn but\r\nwritten; and the only Arabic portolan known to exist was copied from an\r\nItalian example. Long after the Italian leadership in exploration and\r\ncommerce had begun to pass away, Italian science kept control of\r\ncartographical work; thus, among the early portolani, not only the\r\nmajority--413 out of 498--but the most valuable, were executed by the\r\ncountrymen of Carignano and Vesconte.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 245: Cf. (1) the Beatus maps of \"St. Sever,\"\r\n    \"Ashburnham,\" \"Turin,\" \"London,\" of 1109, \"Valladolid,\"\r\n    \"Madrid,\" etc., of the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries;\r\n    (2) the Hereford _Mappemonde_ of the late thirteenth\r\n    century, with which may be compared the Ebstorf world-map of\r\n    c. 1300; see Konrad Miller, _Die ältesten Weltkarten_, Heft v,\r\n    1896.]\r\n\r\nThis department of geographical history is only just beginning to be\r\nappreciated at its full value--as marking the vital transition from\r\nancient to modern, from empirical to scientific--but this need not\r\nsurprise us much. The portolani, as has been well said, never had for\r\ntheir object to provide a popular or fashionable amusement; they were\r\nnot drawn to illustrate the works of classical authors or learned\r\nprelates; still less did they illustrate the legends and dreams of\r\nchivalry and historical romance; they were seldom drawn by learned men;\r\nand small enough in return was the acknowledgment which the learned but\r\ntoo often made them, when the great geographical compilers of the\r\nRenaissance and Reformation times incorporated the earlier coast-charts\r\nin grander and more ambitious works.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably, however, it is in maps of the portolano type that we\r\nmust look for Prince Henry's primary geographical teachers, though the\r\ninfluence of books--and even of the older theoretical designs in\r\ncartography--must not be forgotten. Therefore, to understand his\r\nposition--to realise what he had to draw from--we must briefly describe\r\nthe chief designs which it was possible for him to consult for his\r\nscientific purposes, for his Ptolemaic ambition, διορθῶσαι τὸν ἀρχαῖον\r\nπίνακα [diorthôsai ton archaion pinaka].\r\n\r\n(1) The \"Carte Pisane\" of the latest thirteenth or earliest fourteenth\r\ncentury is probably only a copy of an earlier work, though now itself\r\nour earliest example of the portolano type. The Mediterranean on this\r\nexample (as well as the Black Sea, where it has survived injury) shows\r\nthe new scientific or surveying method, but the Atlantic coasts of Spain\r\nand France, and still more the shore-lines of Britain, are of a\r\ndifferent and inferior character. This alone points to an earlier date\r\nthan, _e.g._, the works of Vesconte and Dulcert. In West Africa only a\r\npart of the Maroccan coast now remains.\r\n\r\n(2) The Map of Giovanni di Carignano,[246] of _c._ 1300?-1310, though\r\nmuch damaged, shows the Black Sea and Britain with contours differing\r\nsomewhat from the ordinary portolan; and the same is noticeable in the\r\nBaltic. The West African coast does not extend to Cape Non. Another work\r\nby Carignano, of _c._ 1306, \"specially referring to Central Asia,\" is\r\nsaid to exist, but its present position is unknown.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 246: Signed \"Johannes presbyter, rector Sancti Marci\r\n    de Porta Janue me fecit.\" A priest answering to this\r\n    description flourished in Genoa, 1306-1344; this may have been\r\n    a younger relative.]\r\n\r\n(3) A portolan of the early fourteenth(?) century, belonging to\r\nProfessor Tammar Luxoro, of Genoa, in 1882, and usually called after\r\nhim, is believed by Nordenskjöld to be a \"slightly altered copy of the\r\nnormal portolano in its original form.\" In N.W. Africa it only gives us\r\nthe shore-line as far as Sallé, with a series of names, beginning at\r\nArzilla.[247]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 247: No Atlantic islands exist on the Tammar Luxoro\r\n    portolan.]\r\n\r\n(4) Marino Sanudo the Elder, to his work, _Liber Secretorum fidelium\r\nCrucis_, written between 1306 and 1321, added an atlas of ten maps.\r\nAmong these, I-V form an ordinary portolano, corresponding especially\r\nwith Vesconte's work,[248] but giving us no special information upon\r\nAfrica; while No. VI is the famous map of the world often reproduced.\r\nHere a thoroughly conventional Africa is laid down, of the \"Strabonian\"\r\nor \"Macrobian\" type: its length, from east to west, traversed by the\r\nNegro Nile from near the Mountains of the Moon to the Atlantic, is equal\r\nto fully twice the breadth from north to south. The deep inlet in the\r\nWest African coast penetrating east to a \"Regio VII Montium\" immediately\r\nsouth of the Negro Nile, is a prototype of the similar feature in Fra\r\nMauro, and is perhaps only an exaggeration of the Sinus Hesperius of\r\nPtolemy. This map was probably known to Prince Henry, like the book it\r\naccompanied, which contained many important particulars of\r\nfourteenth-century trade and navigation. The Mappemonde is a compromise\r\nbetween, or combination of, the portolano and the Mediæval theoretical\r\nmap, and is quite a landmark in the history of cartography.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 248: Konrad Kretschmer believes Sanudo's maps to\r\n    have been draughted entirely or principally by Vesconte.]\r\n\r\n(5) Pietro Vesconte of Genoa has left three or four works executed\r\nbetween 1311 and 1321, and still extant, viz.: (α) Of 1311, which lacks\r\nthe Western Mediterranean and West Africa, what remains giving us a\r\n\"normal portolano\" of the Levant and Black Sea. (β) Of 1318, depicting\r\nthe entire Mediterranean, etc., with the Atlantic, North Sea coasts of\r\nEurope (in ten plates), and West Africa as far as \"Mogador.\" (γ) Of 1318\r\n(in six maps), which for our purposes need not be discriminated from\r\n(β); and lastly (δ) Of 1320, a map of the world, with plans of cities, a\r\nspecial chart of Palestine, etc. The Mappemonde, which principally\r\nconcerns us here, is extremely like Sanudo's, and is perhaps the work of\r\nthe same artist--Vesconte himself. Another work, of 1321, by Vesconte,\r\nis mentioned in Santarem,[249] but its whereabouts is now unknown.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 249: _Essai sur l'Histoire de la Cosmographie_, i,\r\n    272, ed. of 1849.]\r\n\r\nOnce more a work of 1327, signed \"Perrinus Vesconte fecit ... MCCCXXVII\r\nin Veneciis\" is conjectured to be only another \"normal-portolan\" by\r\n_Pietro_ Vesconte.\r\n\r\n(6) Angelino Dulcert, a Catalan, composed in August 1339, in Majorca\r\n(\"in civitate Majoricarum\") a portolan of great merit. Dulcert's Baltic\r\nsomewhat resembles Carignano's, but with more numerous legends. A star\r\n(\"the Star in the East\") placed by this draughtsman south of the Caspian\r\nis copied, or at least paralleled, in the Atlas Catalan of 1375 (No. 9,\r\np. cxxvi), in the Andrea Bianco of 1436, and in the Borgian map of\r\n1430-50, as well as in the Anonymous Catalan planisphere hereafter\r\nnoticed (No. 14, p. cxxviii). Dulcert's Africa probably served in some\r\nrespects as a prototype for the Catalan Atlas of 1375, and Prince Henry\r\nmay have studied the Continent in one or other of these delineations,\r\nwhich are among the most complete pictures of the Sahara coasts and\r\nSudan interior coming down from any period before that of his voyages.\r\nSome of the Canaries are marked in about their right position, with\r\nLançarote showing the Cross of Genoa, and Fuerteventura to the south,\r\nwhile almost in the latitude of Ceuta appear \"Canaria,\" St. Brandan's\r\nIsle, etc. On the mainland a long stretch of shore-line is given beyond\r\nCape Non or Nun, but it is drawn very conventionally in a S.S.E.\r\ndirection, with seven names,[250] or titles, and an inscription of two\r\nlines, the whole seeming to show pretty clearly that the draughtsman\r\nknew nothing at first hand of the coast between Non and Boyador, but was\r\nled to conjecture a continuation of the Desert Littoral. In the\r\nInterior, the Atlas range, the large seated figure of a king with\r\nsceptre, and most of the towns depicted on eminences, reappear with\r\nslight alterations in the Atlas Catalan; which, however, adds many\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 250: One being merely \"Plagae Arenae.\"]\r\n\r\n(7) Next comes the most famous, and perhaps in some respects the most\r\nadvanced, specimen of the early portolani: that usually quoted as the\r\nMedicean or Laurentian Portolan of 1351 (\"Atlante Mediceo,\" or\r\n\"Portolano Laurenziano-Gaddiano\"). The author was anonymous, but almost\r\ncertainly a Genoese, and his work consists of eight plates, or tables.\r\nThe second of these is the Mappemonde, which is the only one that need\r\nbe noticed here. The Africa of this map, taken as a whole, is drawn with\r\na nearer approach to general correctness than on any chart anterior to\r\nthe voyage of B. Diaz in 1486;[251] both the Guinea coast to the\r\nCamaroons, and the southern projection of the Continent, are\r\nextraordinarily well conceived for the time. No details or names are\r\ninserted on the W. African mainland shore beyond Cape Bojador and the\r\nRiver of Gold--\"Palolus.\"[252] In this it is similar to the Pizigani map\r\nof 1367.[253]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 251: See _Azurara_, Hakluyt Soc. ed., vol. i,\r\n    Reproduction at end, No. 1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 252: For Pactolus (?).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 253: A considerable knowledge of the Atlantic\r\n    Islands is also shown, sixteen names being given. This number,\r\n    however, is less than we have in the _Conosçimiento_ of\r\n    slightly earlier date, _c_. 1330 (?).]\r\n\r\n(8) Francisco Pizigano, of Venice, 1367-1373, aided by his brother\r\nMarco, executed two famous works still extant: (α) In 1367, a large\r\nchart comprising a good deal beyond the normal portolano's Mediterranean\r\nand Black Sea;--_e.g._, part of the Scandinavian Peninsula, the Baltic,\r\nthe Caspian, etc. It is signed, \"MCCCLXVII, Hoc opus compoxuid\r\nFranciscus Pizigano Veneciar et domnus In Venexia meffecit Marcus die\r\nxii Decembris.\" (β) In 1373, a normal portolano, signed \"MCCCLXXIII a\r\ndie viii de zugno Francischo Pisigany Venician in Venexia me fecit.\" The\r\nN.W. Africa of these two maps shows no advance on the Laurentian\r\nPortolano.\r\n\r\n(9) The Atlas Catalan of 1375 is said to have been executed for Charles\r\nV of France, in whose library it was entered with the title, \"Une quarte\r\nde mer en tableaux faicte par manière de unes tables, painte et\r\nhistoirée, figurée et escripte, et fermant a quatre fermoners de\r\ncuivre.\" It is in six plates, the last four of which compose a\r\nmappemonde--\"the most comprehensive cartographic work of the fourteenth\r\ncentury,\" especially rich in legends, and showing us the normal\r\nportolan, for shore-lines, blended with the theoretical map, for the\r\ninteriors of countries, all designed on the most elaborate scale. The\r\nWest African coast on this example is brought down to, and a little\r\nbeyond, Cape Bojador, southwest of which appear the Catalan explorers of\r\n1346[254] in their boat, with an inscription.[255] Beginning with\r\nArzilla, and continuing south, we have besides the recognisable Sallé,\r\nCantin, Mogador, and No[n], 35 other names before we reach Cavo de\r\nBuyet(e)der, after which we have only the legend \"Danom,\" and the\r\nconclusion, \"Cap de Finister(r)a occidental de Affricha.\"[256] More\r\nattention is given to the interior of North Africa in this design than\r\nin any other map of the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 254: Jayme Ferrer, etc.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 255: Quoted and discussed above, pp. lxiii-lxiv.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 256: Names are given to twenty-seven islands in the\r\n    Atlantic, among them St. Brandan's isle, most of the Canaries,\r\n    the whole Madeira group and several of the Azores.]\r\n\r\n(10) Guglielmo Soleri, of Majorca, between _c._ 1380 and 1385, executed\r\ntwo designs of some value, both \"normal-portolans:\" (α) is undated,\r\nprobably executed about 1380, and signed \"Guill'mo Soleri civis\r\nMajoricarum me ficit.\" (β) is inscribed \"Guillmus Solerii civis\r\nMajoricarum me fecit anno MCCCLXXXV.\"\r\n\r\nIn (β) West Africa has a fairly good extension, a little beyond the\r\nlatitude of the Canaries, where the rough and torn southern edge of the\r\nmap cuts across all.[257]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 257: The Soleri of 1380 gives twenty Atlantic\r\n    islands; nineteen appear in the Soleri of 1385 (some\r\n    legendary). In neither is any addition made to earlier lists.]\r\n\r\n(11) Next in order comes an anonymous Atlas of 1384 (?) in six sheets,\r\nusually called, after two of its possessors, the Pinelli-Walckenaer\r\nPortolano. It is probably a Genoese work. Its West Africa extends about\r\nas far as (or a little beyond) the Soleri of 1385, to what is apparently\r\nCape Bojador, slightly south of the Canaries. Ten names occur beyond C.\r\nNon, among them Cavo de Sablon and Enbucder.[258] The little harbour\r\nexisting to the south of Bojador seems indicated here.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 258: Bojador?]\r\n\r\n(12) And now, coming to the fifteenth century, we have first the\r\n\"Combitis\" Portolan of _c._ 1410--an anonymous work, but inscribed \"Haec\r\ntabula ex testamento domini Nicolai de Combitis devenit in Monasterio\r\nCartusiae florentinae.\" This is, in some respects, closely similar to\r\nthe Vesconte of 1318.\r\n\r\n(13) Another cartographer of the early fifteenth century is Cristoforo\r\nBuondelmonte--otherwise Ensenius--whose \"Description of the Cyclades\" is\r\naccompanied by maps; who was the author of an important graduated chart\r\nof the North of Europe; and who also left a roughly-sketched\r\nmappemonde--perhaps a copy of a much older work--which may conceivably\r\nhave been known to Prince Henry and have encouraged his explorations.\r\nThis shows an Africa somewhat similar in contour to Fra Mauro's of\r\n1457-9, but almost without names.[259]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 259: Reproduced in Nordenskjöld, _Periplus_, 111,\r\n    and labelled only \"before 1481.\" The only name on the West\r\n    African mainland is well down S.W., \"India [portus?] pbīs\r\n    fons.\" The deep indent on the middle of the W. African coast,\r\n    noticed in several other maps and even in Fra Mauro, appears\r\n    here on a great scale.]\r\n\r\n(14) Last among these works of the \"Preparatory Time,\" we may take an\r\nanonymous Catalan planisphere of the early fifteenth century (in the\r\nNational Library of Florence) closely resembling the great Atlas of\r\n1375.\r\n\r\nThis completes the list of important maps for the period immediately\r\npreceding the new Portuguese discoveries, and shows us the most likely\r\nexamples of cartography for Prince Henry's study. Some of these he may\r\nhave owned; many of them he probably inspected in person or by deputy.\r\n\r\nIt is probable enough that he was acquainted with some of the\r\npre-scientific or \"theoretical\" designs, such as those of the \"Beatus\"\r\ntype from the eighth and subsequent centuries; those which are to be\r\nfound illustrating manuscripts of Sallust, Higden, Matthew Paris, St.\r\nJerome, or Macrobius' Commentary on the \"Dream of Scipio;\" and those of\r\nArabic geographers like Edrisi[260]--to name only a few examples--but he\r\ncan hardly have derived much assistance from them. The great thirteenth\r\ncentury wheel-map pictures--as, for instance, those we know as the\r\nHereford or Ebstorf Mappemondes--expressed the very antithesis of his\r\nspirit; and the same must be said of the greater part of the Mediæval\r\ncartography before the appearance of the portolani.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 260: Twelfth century.]\r\n\r\nFrom certain books of travel, such as those of Carpini, Rubruquis,\r\nOdoric, Pegolotti, or Marco Polo, he may, however, have received great\r\nassistance. The merchants and missionaries who opened so much of Asia to\r\nthe knowledge of Europe during the Crusading period, furnished the most\r\ndirect stimulus for the discovery of a direct ocean route to the\r\ntreasures of the East. And to find such a route by the circumnavigation\r\nof Africa was, as we have suggested before, one of the primary objects\r\nof the Infant's life and work.\r\n\r\nBut, in addition to the Maps of his predecessors, the Infant was almost\r\ncertainly acquainted with some of the chief cartographical works of his\r\nown time, falling within the period of his exploring activity, and we\r\nmust finish this brief survey with some notice of these. Continuing the\r\ncatalogue, we have\r\n\r\n(15) A map by Mecia de Viladestes of 1413. This is a Catalan portolano,\r\nsigned \"Mecia de Viladestes me fecit in ano 1413,\" and is noticeable as\r\ncontaining a reference to the voyage of Jayme Ferrer in 1346, similar to\r\nthat on the great Catalan atlas of 1375.[261]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 261: A work by the same author, of 1457, is said to\r\n    be at the Carthusian Monastery of Segorbe, near Valencia, but\r\n    it is not yet fully identified, and is supposed by some to be\r\n    the same as that just noticed.]\r\n\r\n(16) Four, or possibly five, specimens of Jacobus Giroldis'\r\ndraughtsmanship belonging to the years 1422-1446, viz., (α) a\r\nMediterranean portolan of 1422, signed \"MCCCCXXII mense Junii die primo\r\nJachobus de Giroldis Veneciis me fecit;\" (β) a Portolan atlas in six\r\nsheets, of A.D. 1426, thought by some to resemble the work of Andrea\r\nBianco in river-markings, legends, etc. This work possesses a\r\ndistance-scale, but no graduation for latitude. It is inscribed,\r\n\"Jachobus de Ziraldis [Ziroldis?] de Veneciis me fecit ... MCCCCXXVI.\"\r\nThe West Africa of this work ends at Bojador (\"Buider\"), and gives us\r\nthirty-nine names between Arzilla and this point. Its nomenclature here\r\nis very similar to, though somewhat less full than, that of the Catalan\r\natlas (1375).[262] Besides these two works, Giroldis has left others of\r\nless importance, viz., (γ), a Portolan atlas of 1443, consisting of six\r\nmaps; (δ), a Portolan atlas, also of six maps, dated 1446; (ε?), a\r\nPortolano, unsigned, in the Bibliotheca Ambrosiana at Florence, which is\r\nperhaps his work.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 262: The same is the case with the Atlantic Islands;\r\n    but though giving us fewer actual isles, it supplies more\r\n    names to points therein--thirty-two in all.]\r\n\r\nPassing by the (for our purposes) less important Portolans of Battista\r\nBecharius, or Beccario, of Genoa, executed in 1426 and 1435; of\r\nFrancisco de Cesani of Venice (1421), of Claudius Clavus[263] (1427), of\r\nCholla de Briaticho (1430), there are only about ten maps or atlases\r\nbelonging to this period which have still to be noticed, and which with\r\nsome probability may be connected with the work of Prince Henry.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 263: An important chart for N. European cartography,\r\n    and for the fact that it is one of the earliest graduated\r\n    non-Ptolemaic maps.]\r\n\r\nThese are--not counting the lost map brought back by D. Pedro from\r\nVenice in 1428,--\r\n\r\n(17) The Atlas of 1435-1445, by Gratiosus Benincasa, of Ancona.\r\n\r\n(18) The so-called Andrea Bianco of 1436.\r\n\r\n(19) The Andrea Bianco of 1448.\r\n\r\n(20) The Portolano of 1434-39 by Gabriele de Valsecca, of Majorca,\r\ntogether with one of 1447 by the same draughtsman.\r\n\r\n(21) The anonymous planisphere of 1447.\r\n\r\n(22) The planispheres of 1448 and 1452, by Giovanni Leardo (Leardus), of\r\nVenice.\r\n\r\n(23) The planisphere of 1455, by Bartolommeo Pareto, of Genoa; and\r\n\r\n(24) The planisphere of 1457-9, by Fra Mauro of the Camaldolese Convent\r\nof Murano, in Venice.\r\n\r\nAs to these, we need only remark:\r\n\r\nNo. (17) is the earliest known work of Gracioso Benincasa, consists of\r\nsixty-two maps, and belongs to a MS. giving sailing directions, etc. Its\r\nWest Africa does not call for special remark, though the later\r\ndiscoveries of Prince Henry's lifetime are admirably illustrated in the\r\nsame draughtsman's work of 1468, 1471, etc.\r\n\r\nNo. (18) consists of ten maps, including a graduated Ptolemaic\r\nmappemonde, and a circular world-map, somewhat resembling Vesconte,\r\nprobably copied and re-edited from a very early portolan, with a certain\r\ntheoretical extension.[264] The original of this is supposed by some to\r\nhave been a late thirteenth-century work; its West African names and\r\ndetailed charting end at Cape Non--an incredibly backward point for the\r\ntime of revision, viz., A.D. 1436. A ship is, however, depicted in full\r\nsail far down the west coast[265] of a Continent whose general shape is\r\nconceived as \"Strabonian\" or \"Macrobian,\" with its length from east to\r\nwest, and consequently possessing a long southern shore. The Negro Nile\r\nflows straight from Babylon or Cairo, into the Atlantic, near (but north\r\nof) the picture labelled Rex de Maroco. The western Mediterranean,\r\nAdriatic and Ægaean, as well as the Black Sea and Caspian, are poorly\r\ndrawn, and suggest an early and crude type of portolan.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 264: See _Azurara_, Hakluyt Soc. ed., vol. i, Map\r\n    No. 4 at end of volume.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 265: Is this an addition of the Editor to bring it\r\n    up to date? The reviser must, however, have added very largely\r\n    to this map; _e_. _g_., both Russia and Turkey (?), as here\r\n    depicted, do not correspond at all to the _late_ thirteenth\r\n    century, but agree better with the fifteenth; though for 1436\r\n    Russia seems unduly magnified. _Imperium Tartarorum_ appears\r\n    immediately north of the Sea of Azov. The Moslem prince near\r\n    the Bosphorus is probably meant for the Ottoman Sultan.]\r\n\r\nNo. (19), signed \"Andrea Biancho venician comito di galia mi fexe a\r\nLONDRA MCCCCXXXXVIII,\" was probably executed with a special view of\r\nillustrating the discoveries of the Portuguese along West Africa, and\r\ncontains the enigmatical inscription in the S.W., which some have\r\nconstrued into a Portuguese discovery of South America about this\r\ntime.[266] Besides the interest of this controversy, and of the fact\r\nthat it was one of the first scientific maps drawn in England, this\r\nchart gives us in West Africa some of the earliest indications of the\r\nnew Portuguese discoveries. Thus, beyond Cape Bojador, or Buyedor, we\r\nhave on the mainland shore-line twenty-seven names reaching to Cape Roxo\r\nor Rosso, and including Rio d'Oro, Porto do Cavalleiro (\"Pro\r\nChavalero\"), the Port of Galé (\"Pedra de Gala\"), Cape Branco, Cape St.\r\nAnne, and Cape Verde.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 266: See pp. ciii-cvi.]\r\n\r\nThis example has often been spoken of as the earliest map-register of\r\nPrince Henry's discoveries, but herein it must yield to\r\n\r\nNo. (20), the Valsecca (Vallesecha) of 1434-9, which mentions the\r\ndiscoveries of Diego de Sevill in the Azores in 1427,[267] and maps the\r\nnorth-west coast of Africa scientifically to Cape Bojador (Bujeteder)\r\nand \"theoretically\" for some way beyond.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 267: See p. cxiv of this Introduction.]\r\n\r\nNo. (21), of 1447, inscribed, \"... Vera cosmographorum cum marino\r\naccordata terra, quorundam frivolis narrationibus rejectis MCCCCXLVII,\"\r\ndenotes, as Nordenskjöld points out, not any connection with Marinus of\r\nTyre (by means of a since lost MS., or otherwise), but merely the\r\nauthor's purpose, viz., \"to present here a picture of the world,\r\naccording to the conception of learned cosmographers, adapted to or\r\ngrouped round a skipper-chart or portolan of the Inner Sea.\"\r\n\r\nWest Africa, in this chart, does not present anything specially\r\nnoteworthy.\r\n\r\nNo. (22). Similar in purpose to No. (8) are both the Leardo Maps of 1448\r\nand 1452, which in detail are somewhat similar to the Bianco of 1436.\r\n\r\nThe West African coast of these Designs does not call for special\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nNo. (23), of 1455, signed \"Presbiter Bartolomeus de Pareto civis Janue\r\n... composuit ... MCCCCLV. in Janua,\" is not of high value for its date,\r\nand shows no evidence of correspondence with Prince Henry's work. The\r\nWest Africa of this design need not be specially noticed here.\r\n\r\nNo. (24), the most famous of the whole series, is more fully noticed on\r\npp. cxl-cxliv. Fra Mauro was, perhaps, helped by Cadamosto among others.\r\nIt is noteworthy that the Doge Foscarini, in the letter quoted below,\r\npp. cxl-cxli, couples the success of Cadamosto and the work of Fra\r\nMauro, as two things which should induce Prince Henry to persevere.[268]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 268: See Major, _Henry Navigator_, p. 312.]\r\n\r\nA new mappemonde,[269] discovered by Kretschmer in the Vatican Library,\r\nand noticed in his monograph of 1891, is of 1448; while under date of\r\n1444, Santarem refers to a \"Portolan portugais inédit,\" which is not\r\nfurther known.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 269: The \"Walsperger,\" _Eine neue mittelälterliche\r\n    Weltkarte_.]\r\n\r\nThese were the works[270] which in cartography bore most closely upon\r\nthe Infant's explorations; and we may here summarise the evidence of the\r\nsame as to the advance of knowledge along the West African coast and\r\namong the Atlantic Islands.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 270: On all these maps, see especially G.

But on Dulcert's Portolan of 1339, and on other productions of\r\nthe same epoch, such as the _Conosçimiento_ of about 1330, we meet with\r\nsome of the Islands, and with the Continental coast as far as Bojador.\r\nThus, in the _Conosçimiento_ and the Laurentian Portolano of 1351, \"the\r\nmost important of the Azores, the Madeira group, and the Canary Islands,\r\nare denoted by the names they still bear,\" or by the prototypes of these\r\nnames.[271] The same Medicean or Laurentian map of 1351, the Pizzigani\r\nof 1367-1373, the Catalan[272] of 1375, and others, \"bear inscriptions\r\neven beyond C. Bojador\"--inscriptions, however, which do not in their\r\nscattered and half-fabulous character give any decisive evidence of\r\nactual exploration to the south of this point before Henry's time.[273]\r\nMoreover, the shape of Africa in the \"Atlante Mediceo\" of 1351,[274]\r\nsuggests--though it can hardly be said to prove--actual observations far\r\nbeyond Cape Bojador made by the crews of storm-driven or India-seeking\r\nships. But, after all, the map knowledge shown of Africa to the south of\r\nlatitude 26° N. was so incomplete and so vague--perhaps even in the\r\nLaurentian Portolan the engrafting of a great theory on a tiny plant of\r\nfact--that the claim of first discovery in more southern regions cannot\r\nwell be refused to Gil Eannes, Dinis Diaz, Cadamosto, and the other\r\nexplorers of the Infant's school.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 271: _E.g._, Legname for Madeira, \"The Isle of\r\n    Wood.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 272: We must note that the ship of the Catalan\r\n    explorers, with the accompanying legend commemorative of the\r\n    expedition of 1346, is depicted in this map _as well to the\r\n    south of Bojador_.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 273: Though Nordenskjöld seems to think otherwise.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 274: See _Azurara_, vol. i, Plate 1, at end of\r\n    volume.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, all the Atlantic groups, except the Cape Verdes and\r\nsome of the Azores, were evidently known in whole or part to some of the\r\nfourteenth-century navigators and draughtsmen.\r\n\r\nA good deal of hearsay knowledge about the interior of Africa is also\r\nindicated, as we have seen, in some of these maps, especially the\r\nDulcert of 1339, and the Catalan of 1375; and in this connection we must\r\nrefer to what has been said upon the trade-routes of North Africa; but\r\nthese elaborate pictures of mountain ranges, Moslem kings, traders with\r\ntheir camels, and towns on eminences, have little more pretence to\r\nscientific accuracy than the Negro Nile of so many old geographers,\r\nwhich is probably a mistaken combination of the real but separate\r\ncourses of the Benue, the Niger, and the Senegal.\r\n\r\nOnce more we have seen that the first two portolani plainly influenced\r\nby Prince Henry's discoveries are the Valsecca[275] of 1434-9 and the\r\n1448 map of Andrea Bianco, drawn in London; and that the 1436 Bianco is\r\nprobably a copy of a thirteenth-century work, showing no clear evidence\r\nof the new explorations. As to the Bianco of 1448, we may here add a\r\nword to what has been already said. On this example we find the west\r\ncoast of Africa end suddenly with Cape Rosso, or Roxo, immediately south\r\nof Cape Verde, and \"from this point the coast is drawn straight eastward\r\nin a style which indicates that the country beyond is unknown;\" the\r\n\"outline of this southern shore of Africa being delineated according to\r\nthe maps of the Macrobius type.\" The work of 1448 is frequently copied\r\nin following years; as, for example, on several designs of Gratiosus\r\nBenincasa (1435 to 1482), wherein the west coast of Africa, from Ceuta\r\nto Cape Verde, \"has the same contours and the same names.\"[276] All of\r\nthese charts are believed by Nordenskjöld to be copies of the same\r\nPortuguese original. On the other hand, \"Benincasa's Atlas of 1471 is\r\nwidely divergent as regards the legends, and extends much further\r\nsouth.[277] It reproduces the discoveries along the coast down to Pedro\r\nde Sintra's voyage of 1462-3, and seems in part to be based on direct\r\ninformation from Cadamosto.\"[278]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 275: The Valsecca Map delineates the West African\r\n    coast to Cape Bojador (C. de Bujeteder). Beyond this the\r\n    outline of the coast is \"suggested\" for a distance about as\r\n    great as from the Straits to Bojador, but with no names or\r\n    legends except \"Plagens arenosas,\" \"Tarafal,\" \"Bujeteder,\" and\r\n    at the extreme south, \"Tisilgame.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 276: This is especially true of the Benincasa of\r\n    1467. Nordenskjöld gives twenty-eight parallel names from this\r\n    and the Bianco of 1448 between Bojador and Capes Verde and\r\n    Rosso.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 277: To Rio de Palmeri, immediately beyond Cape St.\r\n    Anne.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 278: This may be seen, as Nordenskjöld suggests\r\n    (_Periplus_, p. 127), by comparing the names on the lower part\r\n    of Benincasa's West Africa with the following names occurring\r\n    in Cadamosto's account of De Sintra's voyage: Rio di Besegue,\r\n    Capo di Verga, Capo di Sagres, Rio di San Vicenzo, Rio Verde,\r\n    Cape Liedo, Fiume rosso. Capo rosso, Isola rossa, Rio di Santa\r\n    Maria della nave, Isola di Scanni, Capo di Santa Anna, Fiume\r\n    della palme, Rio de Fiume, Capo di monte, Capo Cortesi, Bosco\r\n    di Santa Maria. Benincasa, however, appears to have access to\r\n    other sources besides Cadamosto, as many of his names are not\r\n    found in the latter.]\r\n\r\nLastly, a more special notice must be taken of the great map of Fra\r\nMauro, 1457-9.\r\n\r\nIn this undertaking[279] Andrea Bianco is said to have assisted, and the\r\nwork was (either originally or in copy) executed for the Portuguese\r\nGovernment, and assisted by the same. King Affonso V supplied the\r\ndraughtsmen with charts on which the recent discoveries of Prince\r\nHenry's seamen were laid down. Payment was liberal (12 to 15 sous a day\r\nto every one of the common artisans and copyists); and the Doge\r\nFrancesco Foscarini, \"when he witnessed the plan and the beginning of\r\nMauro's work,\" trusted that Prince Henry would find therein fresh\r\nreasons for pressing on his explorations. The completed mappemonde was\r\nsent to Portugal, in charge of Stefano Trevigiano, on April 24th, 1459.\r\nThis was based, perhaps, in part on the map, or maps, illustrating the\r\nvoyages of Marco Polo, in the Doges' Palace in Venice, apparently on one\r\nof the walls of the Sala della Scudo. The \"Polo\" portions of the New\r\nDesign were, however, chiefly in the Far East. In N.W. Africa, Cape\r\nVerde and Cape Rosso are marked, and near the S.W. coast of the\r\nContinent is a long inscription about the Portuguese voyages, stating\r\nthat the latter \"here gave new names to rivers, bays, harbours, etc.,\r\nand that they made new charts, of which he (Fra Mauro) had had many in\r\nhis possession.\" At the extreme south point of Africa is the name\r\n\"Diab,\" with a legend telling how an Indian junk was said to have been\r\nstorm-driven to this point in about 1420, and (without reaching land) to\r\nhave sailed further westward for 2,000 miles during forty days. After\r\nthis the Indians turned back, and after seventy days' sail, returned to\r\nCavo di Diab, where they found on shore a huge bird's egg, as large as a\r\nbarrel.[280] Fra Mauro had also himself spoken with a trustworthy\r\nperson, who said that he had sailed from India past Sofala to \"Garbin,\"\r\na place located in the middle of the west coast of Africa close to\r\n\"Dafur.\" \"Fundan,\" again, a little south of Cape Rosso, may represent\r\nsome Portuguese coast-name which has not elsewhere survived.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 279: See Zurla, _Il Mappemonde di Fra Mauro_,\r\n    Venezia, 1806, p. 62; Humboldt's _Kritische Untersuchungen_,\r\n    i, p. 274; Ongania and Santarem's Reproductions of the Map\r\n    itself; Nordenskjöld's _Periplus_, 127-8.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 280: Egg of the Rukh, or Roc?]\r\n\r\nYet, apart from these references, there is but little evidence of the\r\nnew discoveries forthcoming, and, from a critical point of view, Fra\r\nMauro's planisphere is somewhat disappointing. True it is in certain\r\nregions (its Mediterranean and Black Sea, for instance), of the\r\nportolano type, but in the more outlying parts of the world, and even in\r\nmuch of Africa, it is far more similar to one of the old Macrobius type\r\nof wheel-maps (continued in such fifteenth-century specimens[281] as the\r\n\"Borgian\" design of _c._ 1430), than to a specimen of enlightened\r\ncartography like the \"Laurentian\" example of 1351. The traditional\r\ncentre at Jerusalem is not taken, but a point slightly north of Babylon\r\nserves instead. In Africa numerous tribes and cities are marked even\r\nbeyond the Equator, in regions inscribed as \"Inhabitabiles propter\r\ncalorem;\" but the general shape of the west coast is hardly\r\nsatisfactory. Fra Mauro knows nothing of the great bend of the Guinea\r\ncoast; N.W. Africa appears not as a great projection, but only as a\r\ngently-sloping shoulder of land; Cape Verde is not the westernmost point\r\nof the Continent. This position is given to the traditional \"Promontory\r\nof Seven Mountains\" (north of the Western Nile), which we have met with\r\nin earlier examples. To the south of the Green Cape appears a long and\r\nnarrow inlet of sea,[282] which can hardly be supposed to represent in\r\nany way the South coast of \"Guinea\" from Sierra Leone to Benin, but\r\nperhaps is a combination and exaggeration of the great estuaries so\r\nrecently visited by Henry's seamen--the Gambia, the Casamansa, the Rio\r\nGrande or Geba, and others. The Western or Negro Nile is drawn as\r\nflowing straight from Meroe in Nubia to the Atlantic, passing through a\r\ngreat swamp (Lake Chad?), an elongated piece of open water in the\r\ncountry of Melli (the Middle Niger in flood?), and the course of the\r\nSenegal. South of Cape Roxo, the coast, trending gradually south-east,\r\nexhibits a very broken contour and is fringed with many\r\nislands--evidence only too certain that the draughtsman is working by\r\nthe light of imagination. Finally, although Africa is rightly conceived\r\nas on the whole projecting into the Southern Ocean, and having its\r\nlength or greatest dimension from south to north rather than from east\r\nto west, it is greatly twisted out of shape by the inclination S.E.,\r\nwhich bends round its southmost point almost to the longitude of\r\nGuzerat.[283] The general size of the Continent, however, is more\r\naccurately guessed[284] than on most maps of this or earlier time. Here\r\nFra Mauro is nearer the truth even than the Laurentian Portolano of\r\n1351, so far superior to the work of 1457-9 in many respects. Parallels\r\nof latitude and meridians of longitude are not indicated in the\r\nCamaldolese mappemonde, which has been sometimes referred to as \"an\r\nimmeasurable advance on all earlier cartography;\" and the importance of\r\nthis famous design, as an index to current geographical ideas, and as a\r\nworld-picture of great size and magnificence, possessing in its time\r\nconsiderable official importance, must not lead us to take it as an\r\nexample of cartographical perfection.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 281: Cp. also the elliptical Florentine example of\r\n    1447 (Nordenskjöld, _Facsimile Atlas_, 116), or Leardus'\r\n    Mappemondes of 1448 and 1452 (_ibid._ 61).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 282: \"Sinus Ethiopicus:\" very similar to that\r\n    depicted on the Leardus of 1448.

The subsequent advances we cannot\r\ndate, for Europe, earlier than the twelfth century; when Alexander\r\nNeckam and Guyot de Provins (_c._ 1190-1200) show us that some\r\ninvestigators had advanced as far as the third of the stages above\r\nrecounted.\r\n\r\nIt is now generally understood that magnetic cars, \"based on the same\r\nprinciple as the compass,\" were used in China much earlier than this.\r\nThe Helleno-Roman world of antiquity, in describing the magnet, only\r\ndwelt on its attraction for iron, and did not notice its power of\r\nindicating the poles; whereas the Celestials were aware in the first\r\nplace of the communication of magnetic fluid to iron, and in the second\r\nplace of the mysterious power of iron so magnetized, as early as about\r\nA.D. 120. The earliest use of the water-compass in China is fixed by\r\nKlaproth at A.D. 1111-17; and as to the magnetic figures or magnetic\r\ncars with which in earlier times Chinese junks sailed to the south of\r\nAsia, and Chinese travellers made their way across the plains and\r\nmountains to the west of their country, it must not be assumed that\r\ntheir use was universal. Thus, in the fifth century A.D., when Wu-Ti,\r\nafterwards Emperor, stormed Singanfu (417 A.D.), he seized upon one of\r\nthese as a great curiosity.\r\n\r\nIt is uncertain, as already remarked, when the complete compass, or even\r\nthe polarity of the magnet, was first discovered in Europe. We may,\r\nhowever, note the following evidence:\r\n\r\n(1) Alexander Neckam, an English monk of St. Albans (born 1157, died\r\n1217), who had studied for some time in the University of Paris, refers\r\nmore than once to what we may suppose was a compass needle, placed on a\r\nmetal point.[286] This, he implies, was then in common use among\r\nsailors, and was not merely a secret of the learned. For, \"when the\r\nmariners cannot see the sun clearly in murky weather or at night, and\r\ncannot tell which way their prow is tending, they put a needle above a\r\nmagnet, which revolves until its point looks North and then stands\r\nstill.\" These words were probably written between 1190-1200.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 286: Cf. Neckam's references. (α) In his work,\r\n    _De Utensilibus_: \"Qui ergo munitam vult habere navem ...\r\n    habeat etiam acum jaculo superpositam: rotabitur enim et\r\n    circumvolvetur, donec cuspis acus respiciat Septentrionem,\r\n    sicque comprehendent quo tendere debeant nautae, cum Cynosura\r\n    latet in aeris turbatione, quamvis ea occasum nunquam teneat\r\n    propter circuli brevitatem.\" (β) In his _De Naturis Rerum_,\r\n    c. 98: \"Nautae ... mare legentes, cum beneficium claritatis\r\n    solis in tempore nubilo non sentiunt, aut ... cum caligine\r\n    ... tenebrarum mundus obvolvitur, acum super magnetem ponunt,\r\n    quae circulariter circumvolvitur usque dum ejus motu cessante,\r\n    cuspis ipsius Septentrionalem Plagam respiciat.\"]\r\n\r\n(2) Guyot de Provins, a satirist of Languedoc, in his poem, _La Bible_,\r\nwritten about 1200, wishes the Pope would more nearly resemble the\r\nPole-star,[287] which always stands immovable in the firmament and\r\nguides the sailor. Even in darkness and mist can the Pole-star make\r\nitself felt. For the mariner has only to place in a vessel of water a\r\nstraw pierced by a needle which has been rubbed with a black and ugly\r\nstone, that will draw iron to itself; and the point of the needle\r\nunfailingly turns towards the Pole-star.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 287: \"La tresmontaine.\"]\r\n\r\n(3) Jacques de Vitry, the French historian-bishop, writing about 1218,\r\nin his _Historia Orientalis_, speaks of \"the iron needle which always\r\nturns to the North Star after it has touched the magnet\" or\r\n\"adamant.\"[288]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 288: \"Acus ferrea, postquam adamantem contigerit, ad\r\n    stellam septentrionalem ... semper convertitur; unde valde\r\n    necessarium est navigantibus in mari.\"]\r\n\r\n(4) \"An unknown singer of the same period\" speaks of sailors to\r\nFriesland, Venice, Greece or Acre, finding in the Pole-star a sign-post\r\nin heaven. Even in darkness and mist the star can still help them, for\r\nit has the same power as the magnet of attracting iron. So mariners\r\nattach an iron needle to a piece of cork and rub it with a black\r\nlodestone. The cork and needle are then put into water, and never fail\r\nto point to the north.\r\n\r\n(5) Brunetto Latini, writing about 1260, tells how Roger Bacon showed\r\nhim[289] a magnet, a stone black and ugly, and explained its use. If one\r\nrubbed a needle with it, and then put the needle, fixed to a straw, in\r\nwater, the point of the needle always turned towards \"the Star.\" By this\r\nthe sailor could hold a straight course, whether the stars were visible\r\nor no.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 289: In Oxford, A.D. 1258. This is not a very\r\n    certain tradition.]\r\n\r\n(6) In the _Landnamabok_, or Icelandic Book of Settlement, the main text\r\nof which was finished before 1148, there occurs a passage, probably\r\nadded about 1300,[290] which describes a voyage of the ninth century\r\n(_c._ 868) to Iceland, and explains the use of ravens to direct this\r\nearly course--\"for at that time the sailors of the northern countries\r\nhad not yet any lodestone.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 290: See Nordenskjöld, _Periplus_, 50. \"The\r\n    _Landnamabok_ was written by Are Torgillson Frode, who died in\r\n    1148;\" but \"the passage here in question first occurs in a\r\n    copy or revision by Hauk Erlandsson, who lived at the end of\r\n    the thirteenth century and the beginning of the fourteenth.\"]\r\n\r\n(7) The Arabic author of the _Baïlak el Kibjaki_, or \"Handbook for\r\nMerchants in the Science of Stones,\" relates how, in 1242, on a voyage\r\nfrom Tripoli to Alexandria, he himself witnessed the use of the\r\npolarized needle. He adds that Moslem merchants sailing to India,\r\ninstead of the magnet-needle attached to a straw, tube or cork, used a\r\nhollow iron fish which, thrown into water, pointed north and south.\r\n\r\n\"Subsequently the instrument was improved by degrees, till it assumed\r\nthe shape of a box, containing a needle moving freely on a metal point,\r\nand covered by a compass-rose.\" It is here probably that the share of\r\nAmalfi is to be found,[291] and it may have been Flavio Gioja, or some\r\nother citizen of the oldest commercial republic of Italy, who first\r\nfitted the magnet into the box, and connected it with the compass-card,\r\nthus making it generally and easily available.[292]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 291: \"Prima dedit nautis usum magnetis Amalphis.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 292: Such a compass-box is figured on the margins of\r\n    some MSS. of Dati's _Sphera_ of the early fifteenth century.\r\n    See Nordenskjöld _Periplus_, p. 45.]\r\n\r\nThis it certainly was not in Latini's time. \"No mariner could use it\r\n(the polarized magnet), nor would sailors venture themselves to sea ...\r\nwith an instrument so like one of infernal make.\" In the latter part of\r\nthe thirteenth century, and not before, its use seems to have crept in\r\namong Mediterranean pilots and captains, and in the course of the\r\nfourteenth century it was almost universally accepted.\r\n\r\nA mistake has been made on one point. The first scientific (or\r\nportolano) type of map is generally associated with the first scientific\r\nuse of the magnet; but portolani began while men had not advanced beyond\r\nthe use of the primitive water-compass above described; and \"accurate\r\ndetermination by means of this\" must have been very difficult on a\r\ntossing sea. \"A comparison of the contours of the Mediterranean,\r\naccording to various portolanos, with a modern chart, shows that the\r\nnormal portolano contained no mistake due to the misdirection of the\r\ncompass.\"[293] Nor do the earliest portolani contain any compass-roses\r\nor wind-roses. Gradually these were introduced into the new charts,_\r\ne.g._, they are found in the Catalan Atlas of 1375, in the Pinelli of\r\n1384, and in many fifteenth-century portolani; but not till the\r\nsixteenth century do we have a number of these roses drawn on the same\r\nmap-sheet.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 293: _Periplus_, p. 47.]\r\n\r\nThe use of the quadrant by Prince Henry and his sailors is expressly\r\nmentioned by Diego Gomez; but neither in this case, nor in that of the\r\ncompass, are we warranted in assuming (as some authorities have done)\r\nthat to the Infant is due the first use of astronomical instruments at\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n\r\n               C.

And the captains, falling to talk about the\r\nmatter, agreed among themselves that they should enter into their boats\r\nwith certain of their people, and Luis Affonso Cayado as captain (who\r\nwas to go along the shore), and that he should land with some of his\r\nmen, leaving with the boats another in his place. Then he was to make\r\nhis way by land with those men whom he took with him, and the boats were\r\nto follow after him a short way from the beach, while the caravels came\r\ntwo leagues behind, so as not to be discovered. And as they marched in\r\nthis order they fell in with the track of Moors who were going into the\r\nUpland, and they went in doubt whether they should follow that track and\r\ngo after them, holding that it might be a perilous matter to enter so\r\nfar into the country where they had been now discovered, as they did not\r\nknow the people that might be in the land. But their will, which was now\r\nburning to accomplish the affair, left no place to bare reason; and\r\nwithout more fear they went forward till they arrived at a place about\r\nthree leagues further on where there were some few Moors, the which not\r\nonly lacked courage to defend themselves, but even the heart to fly. And\r\nthese were in all ten, counting men, women, and children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nHow Alvaro Vasquez took the thirty-five Moors.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen those ten Moors had been brought off to the caravels, Alvaro\r\nVasquez, like a man of noble birth, being desirous to show to all the\r\nothers that he loved the service of his lord, spake with Dinis Eannes,\r\nto whom appertained the charge of the government for that day, saying\r\nthat it appeared to him a good thing to order the people to go forth,\r\nsince their coming from their own country was principally for that end.\r\n\"How can you ask,\" said Dinis Eannes, \"that we should again sally forth\r\nwhere we have been so often, insomuch that all this land has had warning\r\nof our presence? And of two things me seemeth that one would happen;\r\neither we should not light upon any Moors to take away, or we should\r\nencounter so many that it would be to our great danger to make an attack\r\nupon them; and so much the more as I am ill disposed for a fight by\r\nreason of weariness. Wherefore me thinketh it would not be well for us\r\nto sally forth again, as far as this land lieth, but that we should go\r\nonwards till we come to a place where we know well they could not be\r\nadvised of us.\" And as they were going in accordance with that resolve,\r\none part of the night being already passed, Alvaro Vasquez, still\r\nconstant to his first design, came again to Dinis Eannes, and begged him\r\nto let him go on shore and entrust him with the charge of his captaincy,\r\nfor that he knew many would go with him of right good will. \"Inasmuch as\r\nthis sally pleaseth you so greatly,\" said Dinis Eannes, \"I only ask you\r\nthat in your going you take good advisement that you bring no harm on\r\nyourselves nor sorrow on the rest of us.\" Then Alvaro Vasquez called\r\nDiego Gil, that other esquire of whom we spoke before, for he knew him\r\nfor a brave man and one of his own upbringing; and they went through the\r\nother caravels in such wise that they gathered together those persons\r\nwhom they thought sufficient for their safety. And all together they\r\nwent on shore--there being yet some part of the night left for their\r\nmarch--but ere they had pressed on any farther, Alvaro Vasquez, wishful\r\nto admonish them, spake unto them thus. \"Friends and Gentlemen, although\r\nI am not one of those three principal captains whom we brought with us\r\nfrom our kingdom, let it suffice that I am committed to you as captain\r\nby him who had the charge to command you. And because want of order is\r\noften a greater obstacle[A] than the multitude of the enemy, I desire\r\nfirst to know of you if it please you to have me for captain in this\r\naffair, that I may command you as men well pleased to receive\r\ngovernance; for much better were it that you should tell me now at this\r\npresent, where we cannot well receive any harm, than when we are away\r\nfrom here, in some place where your disobedience might do hurt, not only\r\nto me, but also to every one of us in this company.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote A: To victory.]\r\n\r\n\"We are all well content,\" said the others with one voice, \"that you\r\nshould be our captain, and well it pleaseth us to obey you as fully as\r\nany one of the other captains, and even better, if we can more perfectly\r\ndo it.\"[B]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote B: Our intended action.]\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said he, \"it seemeth well to me that we should go forward\r\naccording to the same ordinance as on the other day, to wit, that I\r\nshould go with some of you others along the land, and that the remainder\r\nshould keep in the boats within call of us.\" And so, setting out and\r\nfollowing the coast a good way, they fell in with a cape, to which they\r\ngave the name of St. Anne;[N113] and immediately after that they lighted\r\nupon an arm of the sea which ran up into the land about four leagues,\r\nand appeared to them as though it were a river. And on reaching the\r\nentrance of the same, Alvaro Vasquez waited for the others in the boats,\r\nand when they had come up he bade them wait for him there, whilst he\r\nwent along that water, for he conceived that if any people lived in that\r\nland it would be there. The others said that such an expedition would be\r\nvery perilous, if only because the sun was already very high, and the\r\nheat of it was great, and they were very weary for the great lack they\r\nhad had of sleep, and the toil of some in rowing, and of others in going\r\non foot; and all the more because even if there were in that place a\r\nnumber of inhabitants, yet they could not make any good booty among\r\nthem, because of necessity they would discern them from afar; and that\r\nif the natives perceived themselves strong enough to fight with them,\r\nthey would await them, but if not, they could put themselves in safety\r\nquite easily. Alvaro Vasquez nevertheless pursued his journey as one who\r\nhad determined to accomplish some great matter if his fortune were not\r\ncontrary; and so, going forward about a league and a half, one of the\r\ncompany said to the Captain, \"Methinks I see along this stream some\r\nrising objects like houses.\" The Captain looked attentively, and right\r\nwell perceived that it was a village, and so it appeared to all the\r\nothers who were there. \"Now,\" said Alvaro Vasquez, \"our booty is before\r\nour eyes, but it is so clearly discovered that of necessity we shall be\r\nseen before we can arrive at it; and because it doth not appear to me to\r\nbe so great a settlement as that it can hold a people with whom we\r\ncannot cope, still, in order that we may achieve some sort of success,\r\nlet each one run as fast as he can, and so let us stoutly fall upon\r\nthem, and if we are not able to make captives of the young men, yet let\r\nus seize upon the old men, the women, and the little children, and let\r\nus take such advisement that whosoever putteth himself on his defence\r\nshall be slain without pity; and as to the others, let us seize them as\r\nbest we can.\" And before he had quite finished these reasons, many of\r\nthem began to increase their pace, while others were running as fast as\r\nthey could; and the Moors,[N114] like unwary people, little recking of\r\nsuch a danger, when their enemies came upon them, were all thrown into\r\nthat confusion which the fortune of the case required. And when they saw\r\nmen coming upon them so suddenly and so boldly, and armed with weapons\r\nquite strange to them, they were altogether amazed. Whereat our men took\r\nso much the greater boldness, seeing their timorous disorder, and at\r\nonce began to seize upon as many of them as they could, and seeing that\r\nsome sought to put themselves on their defence, they slew them without\r\nmercy. But the affair lasted not long at that time, for that the enemy\r\nsoon began to fly. And there were many amongst them who then looked on\r\ntheir wives and children for the last time, and in a short space the\r\nbooty would have been much larger if that arm of the sea had not been so\r\nnear that many of them escaped into it, inasmuch as for the most part,\r\nnot only the men but also the women and the children, all knew how to\r\nswim. And others who were bold and light-footed, trusting in their\r\nfleetness, escaped through all; though some were deceived in it, for\r\nthey found others of our men who followed and captured them in spite of\r\ntheir lightness of foot, so that in all there were taken captive\r\nthirty-five, besides some that perished. Of a surety that Esquire who,\r\nas we have said, was their captain, found no little praise for that deed\r\nof his, since for a great space they discoursed of his energy and\r\ndiligence, giving him thanks for the great toil he had undergone, as\r\nwell for the service of the Infant as for the profit of them all in that\r\njourney. And, moreover, those who had stayed in the caravels were not a\r\nlittle glad at the coming of their partners with so good a profit, and\r\nthis joy of theirs was much increased when they had heard in full\r\nmeasure the particulars of the adventure which the others had had.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nHow they returned on shore, and of the Moor that they took.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the others who had remained in the caravels, seeing the toil of\r\ntheir partners, conceived that it would be to their great loss if they\r\ndid not dispose themselves to some other matter as great, so that in\r\nfuture they should not receive dishonour. And so some of them joined\r\ntogether on the following night, and entering into their boats, they\r\ntravelled two days and two nights and landed, but with all their great\r\ntoil they were not able to capture more than one Moor; and with his\r\nguidance they set out to search for some three villages, which were a\r\ngood way in the Upland. But they did not find in them anything that they\r\ncould carry off, for they were already emptied of people, since the\r\nMoors who had fled had warned the whole country as far as their news\r\ncould reach. And so they turned back to their ships, ill satisfied with\r\nthe toil they had taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nHow they sailed to the Land of the Negroes.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now, perceiving that they could win no further profit in that land\r\nby reason of the advisement that the Moors had already received, the\r\ncaptains began to consult with the chief men of their ships concerning\r\nthe manner of the action they should take.\r\n\r\n\"We,\" said some, \"are not able, nor ought we to wait longer in this\r\nland, since we know that our stay brings no profit with it, but rather\r\nmanifest loss, for we are wasting our provisions and wearying our bodies\r\nwithout hope of success. Wherefore it would be a counsel profitable for\r\nus, since God hath given us enough, that we should turn back to our\r\ncountry, contenting ourselves with the booty we have taken, the which is\r\nnot so small that it will not be of value sufficient to compensate for\r\nour toils, and to save us from shame in the presence of our neighbours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of a surety,\" replied others, \"such a return would be shameful for such\r\nmen as we are, for if we were to turn back in this wise it would be\r\nindeed an abatement of our honour; but let us go to the land of the\r\nnegroes, where Dinis Diaz with one only ship went last year to make his\r\ncapture; and even if we do nothing more than see the land, and\r\nafterwards give a relation thereof to the lord Infant, this would be to\r\nour honour.[C] Let us reach it, then, since we are so near, and though\r\nwe accomplish but little, a great profit will be ours.\" All agreed that\r\nit was very well that they should go to that land, for it might be that\r\nGod would then give them a greater success than they expected.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote C: Lit., \"would be a part of,\" etc.]\r\n\r\nAnd so they hoisted their sails forthwith and pursued their voyage, and\r\nsailing on their course a space of 80 leagues they came near to the\r\ncoast of Guinea,[N115] where they made them ready with their boats to\r\nland, but when the black men caught sight of them they ran down to the\r\nshore with their shields and assegais, as men who sought to make\r\nthemselves ready for battle; but although they showed so fierce a\r\ncountenance, yet our men would have gone on shore if the roughness of\r\nthe sea had consented thereto; and, far as they were from the shore, our\r\nmen did yet perceive that it was a land very green, peopled by human\r\nfolk and tame cattle, which the inhabitants of the land had with them\r\nfor their use. And they would have gone further on still, but the storm\r\nincreased upon them with much distemperature of the weather, so that\r\nthey were forced to turn back without remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nHow they forced their way upon shore.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that tempest lasted for the space of three days, and they were kept\r\ncontinually running backwards before a contrary wind, but after those\r\nthree days were ended, that great tempest abated, and the weather became\r\nserene, when they had now come to the point where[N116] they had\r\npreviously captured the seven Moors; and on that day the captaincy\r\nhappened to be with Mafaldo, and he waited for the other caravels to\r\ncome up. And when they were all assembled in full day light, he came\r\nupon the deck of his ship and spake thus to the other captains: \"You see\r\nright well that we are near to the place where we took the seven Moors,\r\nand you know that according to the track of those men which we lighted\r\non, and the nets of their fishery, the land ought in reason to be\r\npeopled. Wherefore, if you think it well, I desire to go on shore and\r\nsee if I can obtain any booty.\" And as you see that among many men there\r\nare always divers purposes, some began at first to say that such a sally\r\nappeared to them useless, since they had got enough wherewith to make\r\ntheir return to their own land, as they had already said before they set\r\nout for the land of the Negroes. Others again said that, forasmuch as\r\nthe expedition was perilous, they ought to go by night and not by day.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Mafaldo, \"I am your captain to-day, and you are one and all\r\nbound to obey me as fully as you would obey the Infant our lord if he\r\nwere present, and you may suppose that I do not love my life less than\r\neach one of you loveth his. Wherefore, my purpose is, notwithstanding\r\nyour reasonings, to sally forth, for even supposing that the land be\r\npeopled it is not to be presumed that the Moors will be even now on the\r\nshore waiting for us. And if we go by day we shall have reason to see\r\nthe country better, and know in what direction we have to go.\"\r\n\r\nThe others replied that it sufficed he was captain, for though the\r\ncontrary opinion might be in favour with some of the company, it was\r\nnecessary they should obey him; but they begged him to consider well the\r\naffair, for they would not turn back, no, not for any mishap that might\r\nbefall them. The boats were at once lowered, and those who were to go\r\nforth were accoutred ready for starting, and, in fact, set out at once.\r\nThey were in all about thirty-five men-at-arms, and as they went on\r\ntheir way towards the land, one of the men in the boats said to the\r\ncaptain, \"I know not if you see what I do?\" \"And what do you see,\" said\r\nthe captain, \"that we do not?\" \"I see,\" said he, \"as me thinketh, that\r\nthose black things that are upon those banks of sand are the heads of\r\nmen, and the more closely I look at them, the more it seemeth to me that\r\nI am right, and if you look narrowly you will see that they are moving.\"\r\nAnd the captain ordered the boats to stop still a little, whereat the\r\nMoors concluded that they were discovered, and forthwith they discovered\r\nthemselves to the number of fifty men, apparelled for fighting, though\r\nwith no other arms than lances. And when all had thus come forth,\r\nMafaldo made his boats approach near to the shore, at which the Moors\r\nshowed great pleasure, some wading into the water as high as their\r\nnecks, and others lower, all of them desirous to get at the Christians.\r\nAnd when Mafaldo saw them thus on the beach, displaying a countenance of\r\nsuch hardihood, he signed to the other boats to draw near to him; and\r\nwhen they were all together he made them stop rowing, and began to speak\r\nto them in this wise: \"Friends, you know the end for which we came forth\r\nfrom our country; how it was for the service of God, and of the Infant\r\nour lord, and for the honour and profit of ourselves, wherein by the\r\ngrace of that great Lord who created all things, we have had a good\r\nenough profit of our booty without any danger to ourselves; yet all our\r\nhonour is in being 500 leagues from our country in unknown lands,\r\nincreasing our past victories with new adventures. And since God knoweth\r\nour good wills, He hath appointed us a place and time in the which we\r\nmay gain an honourable victory; for you see before you those Moors with\r\nsuch pride, as if they held us in siege with great advantage to\r\nthemselves and without hope of succour, provoking us, like men secure of\r\nvictory over things already vanquished. And although they are more in\r\nnumber than we by a third, yet they are but Moors, and we are\r\nChristians, one of whom ought to suffice for two of them. For God is He\r\nin whose power lieth victory, and He knoweth our good wills in His holy\r\nservice. But if we do not join battle with them it would be to our great\r\ndishonour, and we should make them full of courage against any others of\r\nour Law. Wherefore my counsel is, that the boats should all three\r\ntogether row straight among them, and then that each one should do the\r\nbest he can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your purpose,\" said the others, \"is good enough and full of profit, but\r\nwhat are we to do if many more of their people are lying hidden? For\r\njust as these were lying in wait, so there may now be ambushed a much\r\ngreater number of them unknown to us, and if there is a snare laid and\r\nwe land, our perdition is assured.\" Others did not seek to correct these\r\nmatters, but began to complain, saying that if they were always to\r\nreason thus, they would never do a single brave deed. \"Is it right,\"\r\nsaid they, \"to see our honour before our eyes, and to leave the matter\r\nthus through fear of a hap so doubtful? All the men opposed to us are\r\nnot sufficient to withstand ten of ours in a fight. For they are but a\r\nhandful of Moorish knaves, who have never learnt to fight except like\r\nbeasts, and the first man to be wounded among them will frighten all the\r\nothers, so that they will not know how to face our arms any longer. Bold\r\nindeed would be the men that have their armed ships in the Strait of\r\nCeuta, and through all the Levant Sea, if they were to dread such a\r\nhostile gathering as this.\" These last reasons were well in accord with\r\nthe will of the captain, and those that spake them were much praised of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWherefore he commanded that in each boat three men should place\r\nthemselves in the prow with lances and shields to protect themselves and\r\nthose that rowed, if perchance they should be shot at by the Moors; and\r\nas soon as they should have rowed the boats ashore, these men were to\r\nleap out at once with their weapons. And he commanded the cross-bow men\r\nto keep their cross-bows charged, ordering their shots in such wise that\r\ntheir bolts should be employed to the best advantage. And after this he\r\nhad the boats rowed as vigorously as possible, telling them to go bow\r\nforward among the Moors as had been before determined; the which matter\r\nwas straightway put in action; and all shouting with a loud voice, \"St.\r\nGeorge,\" \"St. James,\" \"Portugal,\" leapt out upon them as men who feared\r\nlittle the valour of their enemies. And as if in a matter which God\r\nHimself willed to ordain, the Moors at the first onset at once\r\ndischarged their arms, from which no Christian received any dangerous\r\nhurt; but, on the contrary, they proved of use later on, for our men\r\npossessed themselves of these arms and used them as if they had been\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nOf the battle that they had, and of the Moors that they took.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Moors had lost their arms the Christians considered the victory\r\nas won, and began to strike their enemies very briskly like men burning\r\nwith the first wrath,[D] and when some had fallen dead upon the ground,\r\nthe others began to fly. And you can imagine what haste they would be\r\nin; but although the swiftness of the two parties was unequal by reason\r\nof the arms that our men carried, and although they were not so used to\r\nrunning, yet the will, that often increaseth the power,[E] made them\r\nequal to their enemy, so that four or five of those Moors became utterly\r\nweary, and when our men came up with them they sought the last remedy\r\nfor their safety, and they threw themselves on the ground as though they\r\nbesought mercy. And this they obtained, more especially because if our\r\nmen had killed them the profit would not have been so great. And those\r\nin front awaiting the others, who were coming on behind, spake with\r\nthem, saying that it would be well nevertheless to follow up those\r\nMoors; for it could not be but that they had wives and children\r\nthereabouts; and that their journey should not be towards any other part\r\nexcept where they had left them; for though they were wearied they could\r\nnot be so weary but that if they could catch sight of those women and\r\nchildren they would take a great part of them. And so, leaving some to\r\nguard those captives, they went forward, quickening their forces as much\r\nas possible. And the Moors, before they arrived at their habitation,\r\nbegan to give tongue, though they were wearied, as men who called or\r\nwarned other people whom they perceived to be near them, and this made\r\nthe Christians perceive that their lodgment could not be far off.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote D: Of battle.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote E: Of combatants.]\r\n\r\nFor that cry of theirs was nothing else but their warning of their wives\r\nand sons, that they might be able to place themselves in safety before\r\nthey reached them. And at their cries the women came out of the\r\nsettlement, and because the land is very flat they saw how swiftly their\r\nhusbands were hastening along, followed by our men. For which reason all\r\nof them began to take up their children on their necks, and others in\r\ntheir arms, and others before them, guiding them so as best to escape;\r\nand so flying, each their own way, through that plain, the Christians\r\ncaught sight of them and their children, which was the principal part of\r\ntheir satisfaction. And they waxed bold in hope that their strength\r\nwould not diminish or prevent their following up the pursuit; and though\r\nthey were already weary enough, they now quickened their pace like men\r\nwho desired to come where their wills led them. But since the distance\r\nwas great and they were already very much weakened, the Moorish women\r\nalso having but freshly started, they were not able to follow very far;\r\nso that after taking a few they could not go forward any more; nay, it\r\nwas needful for them to await the others who were coming behind, and\r\ntell them of their weakness, which had reached such a point that they\r\nfelt without the strength so much as to return. Wherefore they decided\r\nto turn back, seeing that they could do no more; but first of all they\r\ntook some repose there, the which was very necessary to them, seeing the\r\ngreatness of their toil. And so the booty on that day amounted to twelve\r\ncaptives, what of men and women; but above all their gain, the valour\r\nwith which they assailed their enemies was worthy of high honour, and I\r\nbelieve that up to this point no Moors had been taken with so honourable\r\na victory as these were. Oh how some of those others who had stayed in\r\nthe ships dispraised themselves, and blamed their captains because they\r\nhad not helped them to a share in that honour. Nor were they able to\r\nlisten gladly to the others in all the recital of their victory, for it\r\nappeared to them that they had done nothing in comparison with the toil\r\nof the others. There they began to take counsel what should be their\r\ncourse after that achievement; and leaving out the long debate they had\r\nabout this, it was finally determined to enter into certain bays which\r\nwere between Cape Branco and Cape Tira;[N117] for they considered that\r\nin those islands they could not fail to make some gain. And in this all\r\nagreed, since the hope of profit was of equal strength in the purposes\r\nof all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nHow they found the turtles in the Island.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day they took their course as they had determined, and when\r\nthey got within the shoals they saw an island which was further out than\r\nall the others, but small and very sandy. Here they put out their boats\r\nto see if they could find anything that they looked for; and well it\r\nappeared that the Moors had been there but a little time before, from\r\nthe nets and other fishing tackle that they found, and especially a\r\ngreat multitude of turtles,[N118] which were about one hundred and fifty\r\nin number. And since all those who read[F] this history may not have a\r\nknowledge of this animal, let them know that turtles are nothing but\r\nsea-tortoises, whose shells are as large as shields; and I have seen\r\nsome like them in this our Kingdom in the lake of Obidos, which is\r\nbetween Atouguya and Pederneira. And although in these islands there is\r\nan abundance of good things caught in the sea, the Moors deem this\r\ncreature of especial value. Now our men, considering that those people\r\nhad passed to the other islands--for it seems they had caught sight of\r\nthem--agreed not to take anything of what they found there, for the\r\nMoors would surely return to the island, and this would be a part of\r\ntheir security, by means of which, when they themselves returned\r\nthither, they could get a victory over them.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote F: Lit., will read.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nHow they returned again to the Island, and of the Christians that\r\nperished.\r\n\r\n\r\nFortune would be false to its nature were it always to turn in one\r\ndirection; so now, playing its accustomed part, it would not permit our\r\nships to return altogether joyful with their share of victory; for, as\r\nit is written in the _Commentaries_ of Cæsar, enemies cannot endure a\r\ncontinued distress, nor friends a constant pleasure. Therefore we will\r\nnarrate this event, sad though it be, in this place, that our history\r\nmay keep its right order. And it was so, that on the next day very\r\nearly, the boats returned to the Island according to the agreement they\r\nhad made before, but they did not find there the nets nor the other\r\ntackle of fishery, but only the turtles which were tied with ropes; but\r\nthey supposed that the Moors, although they had snatched away their\r\ntackling, could not be very far distant; and so, standing there and\r\nlooking out on every side, they saw another Island, which was separated\r\nby an arm of the sea that ran between the two, to wit, that in which\r\nthey were, and the other they saw there. And being anxious to meet with\r\nthose Moors, and thinking that fortune would not be less gracious to\r\nthem in that encounter than in all the others they had had in that\r\nvoyage, they determined to go to the said Island, to see if they could\r\nlight upon what they so desired to meet, not knowing the hidden secret\r\nthat contrary fortune had in store for them. So with haste they put\r\nthemselves into their boats, in the which they passed over to the said\r\nIsland, and like men of small advisement, not seeking to consider the\r\nhurt that might befall them, they began to spread themselves over the\r\nIsland as boldly as if they were going through their own property in\r\ntime of great security. And as Bernard said in the Rule which he gave to\r\nRichard, Lord of Castello Ambrosio, upon the government of his\r\nhousehold, that he who doth not consider that his enemy may meditate\r\nthat which he himself meditateth, exposeth himself to danger; so the\r\nMoors having the same thought that our men had had, and standing on\r\ntheir guard more carefully, had arranged three ambushes as well as they\r\ncould, behind some mounds of sand that were there, where they waited\r\nuntil they perceived that our men were near them. Then, seeing their\r\ngreat advantage, they discovered their treachery, and came out stoutly\r\nupon our men, like those who sought to avenge the captivity of their\r\nrelations and friends. And although their multitude was great in\r\ncomparison of the fewness of our people, yet the latter did not turn\r\nback, but faced them like men in whom fear had not got the upper hand of\r\nvalour: contending with their enemies a very great space, during which\r\nthe Moors received great hurt, for the blows of the Christians were not\r\ndealt in vain; but at last our people, seeing the greatness of the\r\ndanger and how they needs must retire, began to retreat, not like men\r\nwho fled, but with all the caution and valour that such a case required.\r\nAnd, of a surety, the battle was very great, and fought as by men who\r\ndid so with right good will; but the greater part of the hurt, till they\r\narrived at the boats, fell ever upon the Moors, for of them many died in\r\nthat retreat, whereas of the Christians, though some were wounded, not\r\none had yet fallen. And when they had now arrived near the boats, since\r\nthat of Alvaro Gil was the nearest or easiest to enter, there were\r\ngathered into that one, and also into Mafaldo's, the greater part of our\r\nChristians; but the remainder, seeking to regain the ship's boat of\r\nGonçallo Pacheco, fell into the extremest peril, for the boat was large,\r\nand though it had the lightest load, yet they were not able to launch it\r\nlike the other boats, which were smaller, so that it stuck fast upon the\r\nshore: for it seemeth that the tide was in the last quarter of its ebb.\r\nAnd some of those men who knew how to swim, seeing their danger so near\r\nat hand, threw themselves into the water, in which they saved their\r\nlives by swimming; but the others, who did not know that art, were\r\nforced to frame their wills to patience in the receiving of a troublous\r\ndeath, defending themselves, however, as long as strength gave them aid.\r\nAnd so there was an end made of seven, whose souls may God, in His\r\nmercy, receive in the habitation of the Saints.\r\n\r\nAnd as the Holy Scripture saith, that he who prayeth for another prayeth\r\nfor himself, may it please you who read this history to present your\r\nprayer to God, that by your intercession their souls may receive some\r\nincrease in glory. The others in the two boats, seeing the death of\r\nthose men happen in this manner, betook themselves with great sadness to\r\nthe caravels; and in this sadness they departed to Arguim[N119] to take\r\nin water, of which they were much in need. And the Moors took the[G]\r\nboat to the river of Tider, where they broke up the greater part of her,\r\nfor they tore out the planks with the nails, but I wot not to what end,\r\nfor their wit did not suffice to make good use of these. And some said\r\nafterwards that they had heard it said by some of those Moors who\r\nchanced to fall into our hands, that their countrymen ate those dead\r\nmen; and although, on the other hand, other of our captives denied this,\r\nseeking to excuse their countrymen of a matter so monstrous, at any rate\r\nit is certain that their custom is to eat the liver of their captives\r\nand to drink their blood: not as a general thing, but only, as was said,\r\nin the case of those who had killed their fathers, or sons, or brothers,\r\ncounting this as a very great vengeance. And this seemeth to me a matter\r\nof no doubt, as 'tis said in the book of Marco Polo[N120] that many\r\nnations in those Eastern parts were generally accustomed to those\r\ncannibal actions; and I see, too, that it is even now a common mode of\r\nspeech among us, when we reason of some man who beareth hatred against\r\nanother, that he hath such ill-will to his adversary that, if he could,\r\nhe would eat his liver and drink his blood.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote G: Captured.]\r\n\r\nBut now let us leave these matters, and return to our history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nHow Lançarote and the others of Lagos asked of the Infant permission to\r\ngo to Guinea.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeseemeth the memory of the death of Gonçallo de Sintra should have\r\nprofited those of whose hurt I have spoken in the last chapter, for by\r\nit they might have taken some warnings and very easily escaped the\r\ndestruction that befell them; and it would have profited them, I say, if\r\nthey had left their boats afloat, considering the custom[H] of the sea,\r\nsince they could not fix the time of their return for certain; but the\r\ngood fortune of their other enterprises gave them an hope that was not\r\nsure, for they thought that it would assist them in this affair even as\r\nin others.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote H: Of ebb and flow.]\r\n\r\nBut now, leaving these matters on one side, let us collect our strength\r\nand go out again and avenge these men. So you must know that Lançarote,\r\nthat knight of whom we have spoken, being as he was Collector of the\r\nRoyal Taxes[I][N121] in Lagos, came to the Infant, together with the\r\njudges and the alcayde and the officers of the corporation of that town,\r\nin the name of all the chief men of the place, and spake to him in this\r\nwise:--\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I: Almoxarife.]\r\n\r\n\"It is well known to your Highness how the dwellers in this our town,\r\nfrom the time that Ceuta was taken even unto this present, have always\r\nrendered service, and do still render service, with their bodies and\r\nships, in the war against the Moors, for the service of God and of the\r\nKing our lord. And so in the time of the other kings, when the coast of\r\nthis kingdom was harassed by the Moors, our ships were the first to arm\r\nagainst them, as it is found in writings and remembered in the memories\r\nof men of great age. Therefore, my lord, since your Grace gave order to\r\nseek for this land of Guinea, you know well how in this place you have\r\nfitted out the more part of your armaments, wherein you received all the\r\nservice that lay in our power. And since, my lord, after the due\r\nobedience we must render to the King, your nephew, our lord, we are most\r\nchiefly bound to love and serve you, we have been considering some\r\nmanner in which our service to you may be of special moment, in such\r\nwise that by the desert of our great toil, our honour may be exalted in\r\nthe memories of the men of future ages. And even if we were to receive\r\nno more guerdon for our toil than that, we should hold it as sufficient;\r\nbut we are certain that over and above this we shall gain great profit,\r\nespecially in the hope we have of receiving from your lordship great\r\nrewards on our return from this service of ours. And in truth, my Lord,\"\r\nsaid they, \"the deed will be of such a sort that the dwellers in this\r\nplace, even after your time, so long as there is an inhabited region\r\namongst us, will be bound to pray God for you.\r\n\r\n\"And if some in their malice should seek to be so ingrate as to strive\r\nto deny this, in presence of your benefits, which they will have daily\r\nbefore their eyes, they would themselves be their own chief accusers,\r\nfor they will see before their eyes great lineages of servants, both men\r\nand women, which they have obtained for their service, and their houses\r\nabounding in bread, which hath come to them from the isles which were\r\npeopled through your means; yea, and there are ancient writings which\r\nwill perpetually speak of the great privileges and liberties which they\r\nobtained from you. Wherefore, my Lord, we having considered about all\r\nthis; and seeing that you toil every day more and more in the war\r\nagainst the Moors; and learning that, in the expedition that Lançarote\r\nmade with his caravels, a great multitude of Moors was found at the isle\r\nof Tider, wherein Gonçallo de Sintra was afterwards slain; and\r\nperceiving that[J] the Moors of the said island are now able to cause\r\ngreat hindrance to your ships--therefore we desire, with the approval of\r\nyour Grace, to take arms against them, and either by death or capture to\r\nbreak their strength and power in such wise that your ships may sail\r\nalong all that coast without fear of any. And if God shall crown our\r\ndeed with a victorious issue, we shall be able, besides effecting the\r\ndestruction of our enemies, to make booty of great worth, through which\r\nyou will receive for your fifth a great profit, and in this we also\r\nshall not be without our share. And to this, my Lord, may it please you\r\nto make your answer, that we may speedily pursue our voyage, while the\r\nsummer time giveth us favourable weather therefor.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote J: Lit., inasmuch as.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nHow the Infant replied to the men of Lagos, and of the armament that was\r\nmade ready against the said island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Great matters,\" replied the Infant, \"be often disprized where things of\r\nsmall moment are much commended; for better is the mean man who\r\nliberally offereth his whole self than the grandee who in niggardly wise\r\ntendereth his share. And, moreover, the offering of your good wills is\r\nof greater price than the great services of more powerful men, which\r\nwere not granted me with so good a grace. And, for my certitude of this,\r\nI need not a surer testimony than your past deeds, by the which I am\r\nconstrained to honour and advance you, with that love and good will\r\nwhich I show to the chief men of each one of my towns or villages, in\r\nthe which, by the grace of the King my Lord, I hold, after him, full and\r\nentire jurisdiction. And as for the permission you require of me to go\r\nagainst the Moors of the Isle of Tider, it is much to my pleasure to\r\ngrant it you, and to grant you also for this my grace and aid: yea, such\r\na request as yours is much to be commended, for one should not so much\r\nprize the hope of a share in profit as discern and praise the good will\r\nwhich has moved you to this.\r\n\r\n\"And now, forthwith,\" said he, \"you can put your matters in train for\r\nstarting, and you may ask of me anything which you require to aid you in\r\nyour preparations, for I will not be less liberal to you in this than I\r\nwould be to any of my Household who by my own especial command were\r\nmaking themselves ready for the said voyage.\"\r\n\r\nAnd at these words of his all made great obeisance, kissing his hands in\r\nthe name of all those others for whom they had come. Now, when all the\r\nothers in the place had heard the message, they began at once to make\r\nready to arm their caravels and pursue their voyage as speedily as they\r\ncould; and the news of this armament went out through all parts of the\r\nKingdom, which news stirred up others to join themselves to the said\r\ncompany. But I believe that this was not without the especial order of\r\nthe Infant, since, as I have said before, no one could go to Guinea\r\nwithout the allowance of that lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nHow the caravels quitted Lagos, and what captains were in them.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this occasion it happened that the Infant Dom Henry was summoned on\r\nthe part of his brother Dom Pedro, who was Regent of the kingdom in the\r\nname of the King, as we have said already, to go to Coimbra and knight\r\nDom Pedro of Portugal, eldest son of the said Regent, who was then\r\nConstable of these realms; and who was ordered to go to Castille, as in\r\nfact he did. Forasmuch as the King Don John the Second, who was then\r\nKing of that realm, was in trouble with his cousins, the King of Navarre\r\nand the Infant Don Henry, who was master of the Order of Santiago, and\r\nother grandees of that kingdom who were with them, because of the great\r\nenmities which had sprung up between the said King and those lords,\r\nowing to the Constable Don Alvaro de Luna. For he, being a man of common\r\norigin and manners, by superabundance of fortune or some other hidden\r\nsecret, came to such a pitch of power that he did whatever he pleased in\r\nthe kingdom, so that for his sake were slain and destroyed the principal\r\nmen of Castille, as you will learn more at length in the General\r\nChronicle of the kingdom, since of necessity the said actions must be\r\ntouched on there. Right well did the Infant Dom Pedro give the world to\r\nunderstand the great dignity that he recognised in his brother, for he\r\nheld it as a greater honour that his son should receive knighthood at\r\nthe hand of his uncle than at that of any other Prince of Spain.\r\n\r\nAnd among the things which I have heard say the Infant spake to that son\r\nof his, when he left him, was this: that he charged him to remember the\r\norder of chivalry which he had received, and especially from whose hand\r\nhe had received it, the which matter was no small charge for him. But\r\nbefore the Infant Dom Henry had thus set out from Lagos, he left in the\r\nchief command of all those ships, Lançarote, the same knight of whom we\r\nhave already spoken; and this was done with the consent of all the other\r\ncaptains: for though there were then a sufficiency of notable persons\r\nworthy of great honour, yet, knowing the judgment and discretion of that\r\nman, it was their pleasure that he should have this charge. For there\r\nwas there Sueiro da Costa, Alcayde of that city of Lagos, who was a\r\nnobleman and a fidalgo, brought up from boyhood in the court of the\r\nKing, Dom Edward; and who happened to have been in many notable actions.\r\nFor he was in the battle of Monvedro[N122] with the King, Don Fernando\r\nof Aragon, against the men of Valencia,[K] and he was at the leaguer\r\nof[N123] Balaguer,[L] in which were performed very great matters; and he\r\nwas with the King Ladislaus[M] when he assailed the city of Rome; and he\r\nwas with the King Louis of Provence in all his war; and he was at the\r\nbattle of Agincourt, which was a very great and mighty battle, between\r\nthe Kings of France and England; and he was in the battle of\r\nVallamont[N] with the Constable of France against the Duke of Ossestre;\r\nand in the battle of Montsécur, in which were the Count of Foix[O] and\r\nthe Count of Armagnac; and he was at the taking of Soissons[P] and at\r\nthe raising of the sieges of Arrasa[Q] and Ceuta,[R] in which matters he\r\nalways approved himself a very valiant man of arms. And this Sueiro da\r\nCosta was father-in-law of Lançarote.[N124] And there were also in that\r\ncaptaincy Alvaro de Freitas, Commander of Aljazur, which belongeth to\r\nthe order of Santiago, a nobleman, and one who had made very great\r\nprizes among the Moors of Granada, and of Bellamarim; and Gomez Pirez,\r\ncommander of the King's galley, of whom we have already spoken in\r\nanother chapter; and Rodriguez Eannes of Travaços, a servant of the\r\nRegent, who was a very zealous squire, and toiled to the utmost of his\r\npower to increase his honour. And there was also Pallenço, a man who had\r\noften fought against the Moors, and who spent his whole life in the\r\nservice of God and of the kingdom, undertaking and accomplishing by\r\nhimself very great actions (as we have said in the General Chronicle of\r\nthe Kingdom) after Ceuta was taken. Other good and honourable persons\r\nchanced to be in the said company, whom we omit to mention, so as not to\r\nbe too lengthy: such as Gil Eannes, a knight and dweller in that town,\r\nand Stevam Affonso, and others. And to speak briefly there were armed in\r\nthat place and year[N125] fourteen caravels, besides some others that\r\nwere armed in Lisbon and in the Madeira Islands, to wit, those of Dinis\r\nDiaz,[N126] who was the first to reach the land of the Negroes, and of\r\nTristam,[S][N127] one of the captains of the island,[T] who went there\r\nin person with his caravel; besides the vessel of Alvaro Gonçalvez\r\nd'Atayde, who was then preceptor to the King, and afterwards Count of\r\nAtouguya; moreover, John Gonçalvez Zarco, who had the other captaincy in\r\nMadeira,[U] sent there two caravels; and other ships were there, of\r\nwhose masters we do not care to make express mention in this place. Only\r\nit were well you should know that in this year there were armed to go to\r\nthat land of the Negroes twenty-six caravels, not counting the Fusta of\r\nPallenço; and among these the thirteen ships of Lagos started first, and\r\nafter them the others, each one as it best could; but they did not all\r\ntogether take part in the affair of Tider.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote K: Vallença.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote L: Vallaquer.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote M: Lançaraao.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote N: Cabo de Caaes.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote O: Fooes.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote P: Sansoōes.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote Q: Ras.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote R: Cepta.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote S: Vaz.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote T: Madeira.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote U: Besides Tristam Vaz.]\r\n\r\nAnd as the history cannot be recounted as well as might be, for that the\r\nvoyage was not made by all the caravels in company, we will only say\r\nwhat we can, in the best manner that we can speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nOf how the caravels met at Cape Branco, and how Laurence Diaz fell in\r\nwith the caravels of Lisbon.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on the tenth day of August when the fourteen caravels set out\r\nfrom Lagos; and forasmuch as they were not able to follow one route in\r\ncompany, and many times tempests overtook them which separated one from\r\nthe other, they made agreement as usual to await one another at Cape\r\nBranco. And starting all together with a favourable tide and wind for\r\ntheir journey, when they were only a little way distant from the coast,\r\nsome of the ships began to show that they sailed better than the others,\r\nand among them all that of Laurence Diaz began to take the lead. But\r\nnow, leaving this vessel and the others to pursue their voyage, we will\r\nreturn a little to speak of the three caravels of Lisbon, which were\r\nleft in grievous case by reason of the loss of their seven men who were\r\nslain, and we will see if we can give them any consolation. And it was\r\nso, that after that event of ill fortune, while they were wholly\r\ndesperate of obtaining vengeance on that occasion, they made sail\r\ntowards the isle of Arguim, where they arrived with the intention of\r\nwatering, and thence proceeding to the kingdom.[V] And when they were\r\njust ready to set out, they began, as it chanced, to speak about their\r\nvoyage: to wit, how many leagues they should follow in one course and\r\nhow many in another, when the sail of the ship of Laurence Diaz began to\r\nappear. And when they saw this, all were so much the more joyful,\r\nespecially as they knew that it was a ship of Christian folk, and what\r\nwas more, of Christians from this Kingdom of Portugal, because no vessel\r\nof that kind, or like unto it, was to be seen in that part save what\r\ncame from our land. Suffice it that this caravel joined the others,\r\nwhereat the minds both of the one and of the other party were very\r\njoyful, and especially the minds of those who were there before, when\r\nLaurence Diaz told them of the coming of the other caravels, and of the\r\npurpose for which they came. \"You others,\" said Laurence Diaz, \"should\r\ntake great delight in our arrival, as it seemeth to me; and since you\r\ndesire revenge for the hurt you have sustained, you have now an\r\nopportunity to take such vengeance. And since the being avenged by other\r\nhands could not be so much to your contentment, you should now put off\r\nyour departure, that you may be with us in the conquest of this island,\r\nby the which you will have manifold gain. First you will obtain honour\r\nand profit; and secondly you will witness the injury of your enemies,\r\nalong with the vengeance taken for your hurt; while in the third place\r\nyou will be the first to take the news of this to the lord Infant, and\r\nmay it please God that the news I speak of be such as we hope, for\r\nthereby your reception shall be so much the better, and with a greater\r\nincrease of reward.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V: Of Portugal.]\r\n\r\n\"You may well believe, Laurence Diaz,\" answered those captains, \"that no\r\nother words were needed to move us to such a deed, but only our own good\r\nwills; but on account of certain difficulties amongst ourselves, it is\r\nnecessary that we first take counsel about what you say.\"\r\n\r\n\"That should be done at once,\" said Laurence Diaz, \"for my stay here\r\nmust not be long, inasmuch as I fear that the other caravels will be\r\nalready at the island, and I should have a great displeasure if they\r\nwere to accomplish anything without me.\"\r\n\r\nThe others said they would speak about the matter that very night, and\r\nvery early they would give him an answer. And to leave out their\r\nprolixities, I will say in a word that their councils were divided. On\r\nthe one side some said that despite all contrary reasons they ought to\r\nmake their way straight home, since they already had booty with which\r\nthey could reasonably make their voyage, and this was all the more\r\nnecessary as provisions were failing them, which all could see right\r\nwell. Moreover, the accomplishment of that deed (to which Laurence Diaz\r\nurged them) was not certain; for it might be that the caravels would\r\nencounter some contrary fortune, by which occasion they would be stayed,\r\nto no purpose wasting their victuals, in which rested the sustenance of\r\ntheir life. Others, however, said that it would be a great disgrace to\r\nthem if they were so near and did not join themselves to the company\r\nwhich essayed that action. \"Were we already\" said they, \"half way on our\r\nvoyage, and chanced upon such an encounter, we should turn back;[W] how\r\nmuch the more therefore, when we are now, as it were, on the shores of\r\nthe said island, and when we are invited to it for the service of God\r\nand the lord Infant. Of a surety we should be ill-accounted of were we\r\nto leave such an emprise for any consideration at all.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote W: And join the enterprise.]\r\n\r\nAll fell in with this accord, for the greater part of the company agreed\r\nwith this second resolution. Thereupon they arranged to order their\r\nprovision in such wise that the victuals might last them a longer time;\r\nand so much were their wills disposed to this venture that some said\r\nthat, in good sooth, it would be better to throw a moiety of those\r\nMoors[X] into the sea, rather than relinquish a matter so honourable for\r\ntheir sakes, and one in which they might get vengeance for the death of\r\ntheir companions. The agreement was thus concluded, and on the next day\r\nthey gave their answer to Laurence Diaz, in whose company they started\r\nat once for the Ilha das Garças, where for three days they waited the\r\ncoming of the other caravels, refreshing themselves with the birds of\r\nthat island, of which there was there a great multitude. More especially\r\nmay we speak of some birds there, that are not in our land, which are\r\ncalled hornbills, and are all white, of a size greater than swans, and\r\nwith beaks of a cubit's length or more, and three fingers in breadth;\r\nand they look like the engraved sheaths of swords, so wrought and with\r\nsuch ornamentation as if they had been made artificially with the aid of\r\nfire to give them beauty; and the mouth and maw is so great that the leg\r\nof a man, however large it were, would go into it as far as the\r\nknee.[N128] Now when those three days were passed the other caravels\r\nbegan to come, arriving at Cape Branco two by two and three by three, as\r\nthey chanced to meet. But there did not meet there more than nine ships,\r\nto wit, those of Lançarote and of Sueiro da Costa, and of Alvaro de\r\nFreitas, and of Gil Eannes, and of Gomez Pirez, and certain others of\r\nthe town of Lagos.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote X: Their prisoners.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nOf how Lançarote held a council at Cape Branco.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose nine caravels being thus met together, for they had yet no news of\r\nthat of Laurence Diaz, Lançarote bade all the other captains go on shore\r\nthat he might speak with them about the course that might seem good for\r\nthem to take; and these captains were very quickly ready. And when they\r\nwere all together joined in council, Lançarote said: \"My noble friends,\r\nalthough it pleased the lord Infant my lord, to give me charge of your\r\ncaptaincies, you being of such honourable estate as you are, yet I fail\r\nnot to know, as is right, how to treat you with the honour that I ought,\r\nand in this wise give you that authority which your honourable persons\r\nmerit; and putting aside Sueiro da Costa, whom I regard as a father by\r\nreason of his daughter who is my wife, I hold nearly all of you[Y] as\r\nbrothers, some by our having been brought up together, and some by\r\nancient friendship, and others by long acquaintance. Therefore I hope\r\nthat you will counsel and aid me as a friend and brother, beyond what\r\nyou are bound in reason to do, in such wise that I may be a worthy\r\ncaptain of such honourable personages as you, for I do not purpose to do\r\nanything, either great or small, without your counsel. And for God's\r\nsake, let each one imagine that the charge[Z] is principally his own,\r\nand so, as if it were a private matter, let him labour to discover\r\nproper remedies for our case. And in truth I am right glad when I\r\nconsider that I am consulting such discreet personages, who have seen\r\nand experienced such great and honourable matters, and whose experience\r\nwill be a very great help in our undertaking, since the government and\r\ndirection of the matters which are to come depend chiefly upon the good\r\nunderstanding of things past.\" \"Now,\" said he, \"we here assembled are\r\nnine caravels, as you see, and you know that in all we set out fourteen\r\nfrom Portugal. I desire therefore to know of you what it seemeth to you\r\nthat we should do. Whether perchance we ought to start at once as we\r\nare, or whether it would be better to await the others who have to\r\ncome.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote Y: Lit., you others.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote Z: Of this expedition.]\r\n\r\n\"We thank you for your good purpose,\" said Alvaro de Freitas (speaking\r\nfor himself and the others, for being a knight as he was, and moreover\r\nof high and noble rank, as we have said already, it pleased all the\r\nother captains to give him that authority). \"We thank you,\" said he,\r\n\"and you may be sure that there is not any one here who will not aid and\r\ncounsel you, not only as captain and friend, but as if you were his own\r\nself; and the reasons for this are many, and therefore I now forbear to\r\ntouch upon them. Let it suffice that all of us know you for a brave and\r\nvaliant man, so much so that not only are you deserving of the captaincy\r\nof these few men and ships, but of many more besides. And as to the\r\ncounsel that you ask, it seemeth to me that although all the fourteen\r\ncaravels must meet together for the invasion of the Island of Tider, as\r\nwas agreed at our outcoming, yet I think it would be well if we who have\r\narrived here already were to go at once to the Ilha das Garças,[N129]\r\nand there wait two or three days, according to the arrangement that we\r\nhave. For that is a place where we cannot be seen by the other side, but\r\nif we remain near this Cape we shall readily be discovered, in which\r\ncase we shall not escape one of two things: either the Moors will leave\r\nthat Island, or so many will enter it that when we wish to attack it we\r\nshall be in very great danger. And if peradventure those other five\r\ncaravels do not arrive at the Ilha das Garças within a few days, my\r\ndetermination would be not to wait any longer for them, but simply to\r\ncarry out what we have[N130] been ordered. And if it be the will of God\r\nto aid us, as I hope in Him, since it is in His service before all else\r\nthat we are come here, that aid which will be ours when we are all met\r\ntogether will likewise be the portion of those of us who are here, or\r\nperadventure in greater measure, since just as we feel our necessity to\r\nbe the greater, so we shall have recourse to His aid with greater\r\ndevotion; and whereas when we were all joined together, we should place\r\nour hope in the strength of men, now, seeing ourselves to be few in\r\nnumber, we shall rest our chief succour on His aid. And now, from\r\nhenceforth, said he, you will be able to ordain that which seemeth to\r\nyou to have the advantage over my counsel.\" \"In good sooth,\" replied\r\nthey all, \"your counsel is so good and so profitable that anything we\r\nshould say over and above would be superfluous, or perchance even\r\nmischievous, as distracting us from the true path in which your good\r\nwords have set us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\nOf how they found the other caravels at the Isle of Herons, and of the\r\ncounsel that they took.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat pleasure was theirs when they came within sight of the Ilha das\r\nGarças and saw the four caravels which were lying at rest, in whatsoever\r\nguise they were there; for it mattered not whether they formed part of\r\ntheir company, since they knew them to be from the kingdom of Portugal,\r\nwherefore they hoped that their assistance would supply the want of the\r\nothers which they expected before. The news of this sight ran through\r\nall the caravels, as they came up one after another, and in this all\r\nreceived great pleasure, and especially the common people, in that they\r\nsaw the captains had taken their determination to attempt the\r\nenterprise, and would not now be hindered by the non-arrival of the\r\nothers, as hath been written above. And as people who did not know how\r\nto conceal their gladness, they made their instruments to sound, and\r\nraised chants, and so fell to eating and drinking as men full of good\r\nconfidence of victory. And arriving at the ships that lay anchored\r\nthere, they charged their bombards and culverins, and made therewith a\r\nsalute in signal of the pleasure of their hearts, in the which pleasure\r\nthe others who were already lying there at rest were not without their\r\nshare. But all this increased twofold the sorrow of the Moors who lay,\r\nas they had been put, under the decks of the vessels, for though they\r\ncould not understand the language, yet the sound of the voices right\r\nwell assured them of the opposite of what they desired. I will not\r\noccupy myself in describing the embracings of our men when they all met\r\ntogether, forasmuch as reason itself will tell you what they must have\r\nbeen at such a place and time; only let us imagine that we see them leap\r\nfrom ship to ship, and that those who had set out from Portugal more\r\nrecently, now offered to their comrades who had gone before the food of\r\nwhich they knew they stood in need. And so, in doing this and in taking\r\nrepose at night, they spent their time until the next day, when by the\r\norder of Lançarote they went on shore, in order that all might take\r\ncounsel together. And when they were assembled, he said how all could\r\nright well perceive the delay of the other caravels, and how God willed\r\nthat they should meet there those three ships which some time ago had\r\nset out from the kingdom, together with one of the five,[AA] which\r\nbefore they hoped to meet. And he showed them that now there lacked but\r\none of their complement of fourteen. So that while they had already\r\nresolved to attack their enemies with nine ships, they could the more\r\nreadily do so with thirteen, but that they should consider if it were\r\nwell to depart straightway, or to wait some little time longer.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AA: _I.e._, the ship of Laurence Diaz.]\r\n\r\nAll said that the delay would be harmful, and they saw no profit in it,\r\nand that they ought to start at once with good fortune, and the earlier\r\nthey could begin that action the better it would be; and in this all\r\nagreed, for in such a time and place there was no fear of contrary\r\nsuggestions, nor of companions betraying their secrets to the enemy.\r\n\"Now, then, that you have resolved,\" said Lançarote, \"to set out upon\r\nthis enterprise in any case, it were well that you, who have already\r\nseen many dispositions appertaining to such an enterprise as this,\r\nshould remind yourselves of them, and aid me in arranging our\r\nexpedition, that we may go on in good order.\" And omitting all the\r\nvarious opinions which were mooted in their debate, it was finally\r\ndetermined that they should proceed on this wise. From the whole company\r\nthat was in the caravels they were to choose two hundred and\r\ntwenty-eight men, because it appeareth that they needed so many in the\r\npartition that had been ordered of their forces, and of these the\r\nfootmen and lancers were to go in the battle of which Alvaro de Freitas\r\nwas captain. Behind him followed Lançarote with all the crossbowmen and\r\narchers, and in the rear guard were Sueiro da Costa and Dinis Eannes de\r\nGraã with all the men-at-arms. And they determined to start very early,\r\nso that before dawn they might attack the settlement of Tider Island;\r\nand three boats with pilots in them went before the caravels, the pilots\r\nbeing men who had already been in that land, and who knew the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\nHow those people landed on the Island of Tider.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am wroth with those pilots in that they so far wandered from the\r\ncourse they should have taken, for of a surety if fortune had not\r\nintermeddled in the mistake of that voyage, the victory would have been\r\nmuch more perfect. But the blame for this was not so much with the\r\npilots as with the darkness of the night, for although they had been\r\nthere before, the previous occasions were not so many that these men\r\ncould fairly be blamed very much for their mistakes at this time.\r\nPerhaps, too, the true cause of the misadventure was the water, which\r\nwas at the neap, so that our men found it in many places so shallow that\r\nthey could not float[AB]; so that finding themselves on dry ground they\r\nwere compelled to wait for the aid of the flood tide, which they did not\r\nget till it was high noon. Oh, what complaints were to be heard among\r\nour men at seeing themselves thus hindered of their purpose by something\r\nin which their strength could avail nothing. \"Ah, God,\" said they, \"Thou\r\nwillest to be less favourable to this our enterprise than Thou hast been\r\nmany times to others, who had not so fervent a purpose to serve Thee\r\nThis day, on which Thy Holy Name might have cause to be so much\r\nglorified and our honour so much exalted, Thou givest place to the\r\nfeeble power of one element of Thy creation, which is of force to hinder\r\nus. Have mercy on us by Thy sacred pity, and aid us, for we are Thy\r\nservants, sinners though we be, for the greatness of Thy benignity is\r\nmore than the multitude of our sins. And if Thou didst exert Thy power\r\nto open a way for the Children of Israel through the midst of the\r\nwaters, and madest the sun to turn back at the request of Joshua against\r\nthe course of Nature, why wilt Thou not show as great a favour to this\r\nThy people, so that Thy miracle may appear before our eyes, and that\r\nthese waters may rise before their time, and that our voyage may be\r\ndirected to gain a perfect victory.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AB: Their boats.]\r\n\r\nSo toiled those seamen during that night as best they could, but for the\r\ntwo reasons that I have already given, they did not reach the island\r\ntill the sun was high. And before they arrived at the harbour where they\r\nhad to disembark, they arranged that all the caravels should join\r\ntogether, and they sailed in so close together that the men jumped from\r\none into another. And then there arose among them a new opinion, for\r\nsome said that it was not in reason that they should land, inasmuch as\r\nit was well known that many Moors were collected there, and they would\r\ncertainly be more in number than they were before, on account of the\r\ncaravels from Lisbon, which had visited the place some days ago and had\r\nlost in that island, not fifteen days before, the seven men of whom we\r\nspoke. At least, they said, they ought not to land that day, inasmuch as\r\nthey supposed that the Moors were numerous, and were lying hid in\r\nambushes, since none appeared. And this surmise was not confined to a\r\nfew, but prevailed throughout the greater part of the rank and file.\r\n\"Friends,\" said the captains, \"it is for war, and for war alone, that we\r\nare come to this land; and this being so, we must not be timid, for if\r\nwe fight our battle by day it will be much more to our honour than if we\r\nfight by night--attacking the Moors of this island, and expelling them,\r\nby sheer force of arms rather than by any cunning or stratagem. Better\r\nthe former way of battle, even if we fail to kill or take a single man,\r\nthan the latter with a night capture of a thousand prisoners. And so in\r\nGod's name,\" said they, \"let us set forth at once, and let us take land\r\nin our predetermined order\". And with these words they began forthwith\r\nto disembark, and as soon as they were all on shore, they put their\r\nranks in order; and Lançarote, by agreement with all the other captains,\r\ntook the Banner of the Crusade, which the Infant Dom Henry had given him\r\n(and you already know how those who died under the said banner were\r\nabsolved from sin and punishment, according to the grant of the Holy\r\nFather, whose mandate you have seen and the tenor thereof). And this\r\nbanner was entrusted to Gil Eannes,[N131] Knight of the Infant's\r\nHousehold, a native of Lagos, about whom we have spoken to you before.\r\nAnd although Lançarote understood the value and virtues of this man, yet\r\nhe made him swear forthwith and took fealty of him, that not for fear\r\nnor for danger would he leave the said banner till death; and the others\r\nalso swore to him that in consequence they would toil to guard and\r\ndefend him even to the last moment of their life. And when these things\r\nwere done, our men, so arrayed, began to move forward in the\r\npredetermined order, and went a space of three leagues over sand, the\r\nday being very hot, till they arrived at the place of Tider,[AC] which\r\nis in the interior of the said island, close to which they saw a\r\nmultitude of Moors drawn up as if to fight. Now this sight was a very\r\njoyful one to the Christians, and so they bade \"sound the trumpets,\" and\r\nwent at them with right good will; but the Moors, losing their first\r\ncourage, began to fly, casting themselves into the water and swimming\r\nacross a creek which maketh that land an island, to the which[AD] their\r\nwomen and children had passed over already with all their poor goods;\r\nbut they were not able with all their haste to prevent our men from\r\nkilling eight of them and taking four. And there one of the men of Lagos\r\nwas wounded, for he sought to outstrip the others to show his valour, so\r\nthat almost of his own free will he received the said wounds of the\r\nwhich he afterwards died when at sea, and may the Lord God receive his\r\nsoul into the company of the saints. And so the Moors having been\r\nrouted, the Christians, perceiving that a longer stay there would not\r\nprofit them, betook themselves to that place where the enemy had had\r\ntheir habitations before, and there they found a supply of water, which\r\nafter the heat and toil they had suffered gave them great pleasure, for\r\nmany would have perished with thirst if they had not found it. Also they\r\ndiscovered there cotton trees, although there were not many of them.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AC: Tidre.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AD: Viz., island.]\r\n\r\nNow the weariness of some of our men was so great that they could not by\r\nany means return on foot; but they found a great succour for their need\r\nin some asses, of which there were many in the island, and riding on\r\nthese they returned to their ships. But before they entered into their\r\nboats, there were some that asked that noble man, Sueiro da Costa, that\r\nhe would consent to be knighted; and to this he agreed, either at the\r\npressing demands of his friends, or because he desired it for his own\r\ngreater honour: saying that it pleased him so long as he received it\r\nfrom the hand of Alvaro de Freitas,[N132] since he knew him to be such a\r\nknight that his own knighthood would be beyond reproach. And at this all\r\nthe company were very glad, and especially those chief men who knew\r\nhim.[AE] And so that noble man was made a knight, and I marvel at his so\r\nlong toiling in the profession of arms and being so distinguished in the\r\nsame, without ever having been willing to receive that honour of\r\nknighthood until this occasion. Of a surety, saith our Author, I well\r\nbelieve that though Alvaro de Freitas was such a noble knight, and it\r\nhad happened to him to create others like him,[AF] yet never had his\r\nsword touched the head of so noble and so eminent a man; nor was the\r\nsaid Alvaro de Freitas a little honoured by the circumstance that Sueiro\r\nda Costa sought to be knighted at his hand, when he could have obtained\r\nthe same from very honourable kings and great princes, who would have\r\nbeen very content to show him that grace for the knowledge they had of\r\nhis great valour.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AE: Sueiro da Costa.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AF: Sueiro da Costa.]\r\n\r\nThat night they went back to their caravels to rest, and on the next day\r\nthey went on shore, to perform the knighting of Dinis Eannes de Graã,\r\nthe which was likewise done by the hand of Alvaro de Freitas. And there\r\nthe caravels of Lisbon took leave of the others, because they perceived\r\nthat their stay there was no longer necessary, and provisions failed\r\nthem, so that if their voyage were delayed by any contrary hap they\r\nwould of necessity be placed in great suffering. But it may well be\r\nbelieved that if they had known that so many Moors were yet to be slain\r\nand taken in that island, they would not have departed so quickly,[AG]\r\nif only for the fulfilment of a greater vengeance. Of the other Moors\r\nwho were taken at Tider, Lançarote and the other captains sent one to\r\nCape St. Vincent; and to Sta. Maria da Augua da Lupe, a hermitage which\r\nis in that district of Lagos, they sent another to be sold, that with\r\nthe price of him ornaments might be bought for that church.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AG: But would have waited.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\nHow they returned again to Tider, and of the Moors that they took.\r\n\r\n\r\nMe seemeth it is not necessary that we should speak of the arrival of\r\nthe caravels at Lisbon, nor that we should fill up this writing of ours\r\nwith a recital of the sale of the Moors, as we found it in the account\r\nof Affonso Cerveira, from whom we have borrowed this record; for already\r\nthe men of that city[AH] were accustomed to the coming of Moors from\r\nthat land: for, as saith Fra Gil de Roma, in the first part of his first\r\nbook,[N133] _De Regimine Principum_, \"the property of temporal goods, as\r\nregards the desires of men is of such a kind that before a man\r\npossesseth them, they appear to him much more valuable than in truth\r\nthey are; but after he hath acquired them, the contrary happeneth, for\r\nhowever vast and good they may be, he holdeth them not in so great\r\naccount.\" And returning to our history: as soon as those three caravels\r\nhad set out, there arrived other three out of those four which had\r\nfailed to come before, and among these there was no small complaining\r\nthat they had not been with their companions at the invasion of the\r\nisland; for although the fighting was not greater than we have related,\r\nit appeared to them that whatever they might do they could not hope to\r\nwin any honour;[AI] and so like men who felt jealous at it, they called\r\nupon the others forthwith to order a sortie upon the land: and upon this\r\nmatter they took counsel, and after some debate they determined that the\r\nthree smallest caravels should go to the ford of the creek of Tider, and\r\nthat the people of the other caravels should go likewise in the boats.\r\nFor it might be that the natives would return to the island, in which\r\ncase they could take some of them in that spot.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AH: Lisbon.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AI: After what had already been accomplished.]\r\n\r\nAnd beginning to put their plan in action, they set out in the night;\r\nyet they were not able to reach the passage till day. And arriving\r\nthere, they saw the Moors on the other side; and the Christians being in\r\nfront of the ford--which was a broad sheet of water, though shallow,\r\nexcept for the distance of a stone's cast that could not be crossed\r\nwithout swimming--the Moors stood still on the other side of it looking\r\nat them.[AJ] But of them they seemed to have small fear indeed; and\r\ntheir countenances showed that it was so, for they were dancing and\r\nrejoicing like men who are secure from their enemies, to whom they made\r\nthose signs, as if to enrage them by scoffing at their approach. But it\r\nwould have been well for them if they had been better advised, and\r\nespecially if they had remained further in the creek, where the water\r\nwas deep, for so they would have been in greater security in regard to\r\nwhat chanced to them afterwards. The Christians, besides the desire they\r\nhad to get at them, when they saw their behaviour, which was that of\r\nenemies who despised them, felt doubly eager to fight, although the\r\nMoors were many more in number.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AJ: The Christians.]\r\n\r\nSo, although they suffered great hindrance from the water, which was\r\nbetween ebb and flow, the ardent desire they had forced them to pursue\r\ntheir purpose. And so they began to enter into the water till they came\r\nto that deep place which could not be passed without swimming, and\r\narriving there they halted, as they held the crossing to be dangerous.\r\nAnd while they stood there battling as it were with themselves, for\r\ncourage urged them on, and fear replied to courage with the threat of\r\ndeath, there happened to be among them a youth of the Infant's chamber,\r\nwhom I afterwards knew as a noble esquire, and who was now going as\r\npurser in one of these caravels--for it was the custom of the Infant not\r\nto give the position of an esquire to any youth of his court till he had\r\nexercised himself in some feat of arms; and according to their merit he\r\ngranted them in the future such dignity as he thought they deserved. Now\r\nthis youth, who was named Diego Gonçalvez, mastered by the ardour of his\r\ncourage, spake to a man of Lagos who was near him, called Pero\r\nAllemam[N134] (I do not know if it was because he was a native of that\r\ncountry of Germany, or if it was a nickname that had been given him),\r\nand asked him if he would join him in swimming across. \"By my faith,\"\r\nreplied the other, \"you could not ask me a matter I would grant you with\r\ngreater willingness;\" and before he had finished his answer he plunged\r\ninto the water and began to swim, and the youth with him; and after him\r\nan esquire of the Infant's Household, named Gil Gonçalvez, who had been\r\nat the taking of the first Moorish prisoners, under the captaincy of\r\nAntam Gonçalvez, and also in the war waged against those other Moors who\r\nborder upon our Spain, and he had the reputation of being a valiant man.\r\nAnd immediately after them went another youth of the Prince's Household,\r\nwho was named Lionel Gil, and a son of that knight to whom the banner of\r\nthe crusade had been entrusted, and many others followed after these.\r\nBut the enemy, though they saw them, judged this movement of their toil\r\nto be but play, boldly trusting in their multitude, and thinking that\r\nvictory would hasten to them as it had come the other day, when they\r\nslew the seven men from the other caravels. But our men, as soon as they\r\ngained a foothold, stood erect and pressed on as far as they could until\r\nthe enemy fell on them. So the Christians, in order to gain the land,\r\nand the Moors in order to prevent them, began their fight, plying their\r\nlances, by the which there could well be seen the hatred there was\r\nbetween them. But the fight on the part of the Moors was not so much\r\nfrom enmity as in defence of their women and children, and still more\r\nfor the salvation of their own lives. Our men wondered greatly at the\r\ncourage they perceived in their enemies; and though the comparison was\r\nunequal in the number of the two parties, for the Moorish company was\r\nvery much greater, yet, God being willing to aid His own, they slew out\r\nof hand sixteen, and the others were routed in a very short space. And\r\nalthough the love of their women and children was of surpassing strength\r\nbefore all other passions of theirs, as is natural in all men, yet,\r\nseeing themselves routed, all their care was to provide for their own\r\nsafety; for, however terrible other matters may be, death doth put an\r\nend to all. And so, being conquered, they began to fly, and there\r\nperished many of them. But because the heat was very great, and our men\r\nwere sore wearied, they were not able to pursue them far; but they took\r\nfifty-seven of them, and with them returned to the caravels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\nHow they went to Tira.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough all had toiled in that action, and though all deserve a meed of\r\npraise and honour for the same, yet principally the aforesaid Diego\r\nGonçalvez and that man of Lagos who passed over with him are to be\r\npraised, for the reason that I have already mentioned: for to the\r\nbeginnings of an enterprise the greater praises are due. And, in fact,\r\nit was so regarded by the Infant, for he bestowed a rich reward upon\r\nthem afterwards, as he was ever accustomed to do upon those who served\r\nhim well. So, when those captured Moors had been brought on board the\r\nships, our men began at once to ask of some of them, separately, where\r\nthey thought they would find the others that had escaped from the\r\ncompany; and our prisoners made reply that their opinion was that the\r\nrest would be at a settlement called Tira, which was on the mainland by\r\nthe sea-shore, about eight leagues distant. And considering that the\r\nearlier they went after them the more profitable their going would be,\r\nfor they imagined that such a short time having elapsed they would find\r\nthe Moors quite off their guard--for this reason, then, they set off at\r\nonce that very night with three caravels, the smallest and lightest in\r\ntheir fleet, and all the other people went in the boats, taking with\r\nthem two Moorish women to show them the way. And in the first quarter of\r\nthe night they arrived at a point where they left their ships and\r\nlanded; and because they did not conceive it yet to be a fit time to\r\nstart, they rested there till the dawn began to break, and by the aid of\r\nits brightness they began to make their way. And coming to a crossing of\r\na little arm of the sea, they fell in with a multitude of canoes, among\r\nwhich was the boat which the Moors had taken from the caravels of\r\nLisbon, but it was now almost broken up. However, they took it with them\r\nto carry back to the caravels. And passing on, they fell in with a Moor,\r\nwhom they killed--as I believe because he himself sought the way to it.\r\nAnd so they arrived over against Tira and two other villages, but they\r\ndid not find in these anything that they sought, since the Moors had all\r\nfled. And so they had to turn back to the caravels, and thence they\r\npassed over to Tider, where they rested by reason of the water that was\r\nthere. While they were staying there, the captains bade some of them go\r\nfor asses, that the weak ones might return on them to the ships; and\r\nwhile these were carrying out what had been commanded them, they met\r\nwith five Moors, whom they took with but little trouble. And so being\r\nreturned, Lançarote said that as it was now late they should rest for\r\nthat night, and that on the next day he wished to discuss certain\r\nmatters with them, which they would know then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\nOf the words that Lançarote spake.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the next day, when all the principal men were met together by order\r\nof the chief captain, as you have heard already, as well as all the\r\nothers who wished to come, Lançarote said:--\"Friends and gentlemen,--In\r\nthat it was the grace of the Infant, our lord, to make me your captain,\r\nand your pleasure and will consented that it should be so, and because I\r\nhere represent his person, I now in his name thank you all for your\r\ngreat toil and good will, which I have found in one and all of you in\r\nthis action, whereto you came in his service: the which I will myself\r\nrecount to him when it please God that we stand again before him, in\r\nsuch wise that for the deserts of your toil you may obtain that guerdon\r\nwhich you so justly merit.\r\n\r\n\"Now you know how we set out from our town with the main object of\r\ncoming to the conquest of this island, and as God hath willed to\r\ndespatch and guide us to it, we owe Him for this much thanks; for even\r\nthough we did not take so many Moors as formerly, yet our victory was\r\nadequate, since in half a day we surrounded and attacked them as you\r\nhave seen, and great as was their number, they left the field to our\r\ntriumph, and we entered into their country and took their property\r\nwithout any hindrance; thus securing for ourselves honour and praise\r\namong all those who shall have a true understanding of the matter. And\r\nas for our coming here, according to the plan we brought with us, the\r\nmatter has been performed, so that I cease to be your captain: for,\r\naccording to the directions that I have from the lord Infant,[N135]\r\nafter the capture of this island each one of you may do what he\r\npleaseth, so as to go wherever he may perceive his advantage or profit\r\nto lie. And so it seemeth good to me that these few prisoners we have\r\ntaken should be divided in such wise that each one may have his own\r\nrightful share and go wherever he think best. And for my part, I assure\r\nyou that I am ready for whatever toil or peril may come to me in the\r\nservice of God and of the Infant, my lord, for with so small a booty I\r\ndo not intend to go back to his presence.\" All the rest replied that\r\nwhat Lançarote had said was very well considered, and they began\r\nforthwith to divide the booty[AK] into equal parts, according to which\r\neach one received what his lot gave him. And after that, Lançarote\r\nrequired of all the other captains what they were wishful to do. Sueiro\r\nda Costa and Vicente Diaz, the owner of a ship, and Gil Eannes and\r\nMartin Vicente, pilot, and John Diaz, also owner of a ship, replied that\r\nforasmuch as their caravels were small and winter was very near, they\r\nheld it as perilous to remain and proceed any further, wherefore they\r\nintended to return home to Portugal. But of the manner of their return\r\nwe will speak fully later on in this history.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AK: Of captives.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\nOf the words which Gomez Pirez spoke, and how they went to the land of\r\nGuinea.\r\n\r\n\r\nGomez Pirez, who was there in that caravel of the King as chief captain,\r\nbeing a man of valour and authority, began to speak of his purpose\r\nbefore them all on this wise: \"Me seemeth,\" said he, \"that the\r\ndetermination of the captains of these little caravels is to turn back\r\nto the kingdom, in fear of the danger that may come upon them if the\r\nwinter finds them further than we are now. But as for you others,\r\nhonorable sirs and friends, you know right well the will of the lord\r\nInfant: how much store he setteth on knowing somewhat of the land of the\r\nNegroes, and especially of the river of Nile,[N136] for which reason I\r\nam resolved to make my voyage to that land, toiling as much as I can to\r\nget at it; and I purpose also to gain the most perfect knowledge that I\r\ncan of other matters, and on this I place all my hope of the greatest\r\nguerdon that I can gain on this voyage: a guerdon that will not be small\r\nfor me, for I know how the lord Infant will show me grace and honour for\r\nit, whereby I may obtain a greater profit; and since I have a ship good\r\nenough, I should do wrong in taking any other course than this,[AL] and\r\nif any one of the rest of you desire to keep me company I will hold fast\r\nto all your ordinance so long as it be not outside this plan of mine.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AL: Viz., pushing forward.]\r\n\r\n\"Of a truth I tell you,\" replied Lançarote, \"that this purpose of yours\r\nwas also mine above all else, before you had said anything concerning\r\nit; and it pleaseth me to fall in with your proposal, inasmuch as it was\r\nso commanded me of the Infant, my lord.\" \"And I,\" said Alvaro de\r\nFreitas, \"am not a man to hold aloof from such a company; but I say, let\r\nus press on by all means whither soever you desire to go, be it even to\r\nthe terrestrial Paradise.\"[N137] With these men three others agreed, to\r\nwit, Rodrigue Annes de Travaços, a knight of the Regent's household, and\r\nLaurence Diaz of the same standing in the household of the Infant Dom\r\nHenry, and Vicente Diaz, a trader. And all these, being settled in this\r\npurpose, began at once to pursue their voyage. And after these there set\r\nout other two caravels, to wit, one of Tavilla, and another belonging to\r\na man of Lagos called Bicanço, but concerning the voyage of these latter\r\nwe will defer our account to another place, forasmuch as they did not\r\narrive at the land of the Negroes.\r\n\r\nAnd so those six caravels having set out, pursued their way along the\r\ncoast, and pressed on so far that they passed the land of Sahara,\r\nbelonging to those Moors which are called Azanegues, the which land is\r\nvery easy to distinguish from the other[AM] by reason of the extensive\r\nsands that are there, and after it by the verdure which is not to be\r\nseen in it[AN] on account of the great dearth of water there, which\r\ncauseth an exceeding dryness of the soil. And to this land resort\r\nusually all the swallows, and also all the birds that appear at certain\r\ntimes in this our kingdom, to wit, storks, quails, turtle-doves,\r\nwry-necks, nightingales and linnets, and other birds of various species.\r\nAnd many are there, by reason of the cold of the winter, that go from\r\nthis land[AO] and journey to that one[AP] for the sake of its warmth.\r\nBut other kinds of birds leave it in the winter, such as falcons,\r\nherons, ring-doves, thrushes, and other birds that breed in that land,\r\nand afterwards they come and take refuge in this because of the food\r\nthey find here suitable to their nature. And of these birds the men of\r\nthe caravels found many upon the sea, and others on land at their\r\nbreeding-places. And since I have begun to speak of this matter, I will\r\nnot omit to say a little more about the divers other kinds of birds and\r\nfishes that I hear are to be found in that land: among which we may\r\nspeak first of all of some birds called flamingoes, which are of the\r\nsame size as herons, with necks as long, but with short feathers; also\r\ntheir heads are small in comparison with their bodies, but their beaks\r\nare huge, though short, and so heavy that their necks are not well able\r\nto support the weight of them, in such wise that for the aid of these\r\nsame necks they always have their beaks against their legs and rested\r\nupon them, or else upon their feathers for the residue of the\r\ntime.[N138] And there also are other birds larger than swans, called\r\nhornbills, of which I have already spoken. And as for the fishes of\r\nthese parts, there are some that have mouths three or four palms long,\r\nsome smaller and others larger, in which mouths there are teeth both on\r\nthe one side and on the other, so close together that a finger could not\r\nbe put between one and another, and all are of fine bone, a little\r\nlarger than those of a saw and farther apart; and these fish are some as\r\nlarge as and others greater than sharks, and the jaw-bones of these are\r\nin size not greater than those of other fish. And there is another kind\r\nof fish there, as small as mullet, that have, as it were, crowns on\r\ntheir heads, like gills, through which they breathe; and if they are\r\nturned over and put with these crowns below in a basin, they lay hold so\r\nfirmly that on attempting to withdraw them they lift the basin with\r\nthem, even as the lampreys do with their mouths while they are\r\nquite[N139] alive. And there are also many other birds and animals and\r\nfish in that land whose appearance we do not care to describe at length,\r\nas it would be an occasion of wandering too far from our history.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AM: Which they had now come to.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AN: The Sahara.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AO: Portugal.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AP: The Sahara.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\nHow those caravels arrived at the river of Nile, and of the Guineas that\r\nthey took.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow these caravels having passed by the land of Sahara, as hath been\r\nsaid, came in sight of the two palm trees[N140] that Dinis Diaz had met\r\nwith before, by which they understood that they were at the beginning of\r\nthe land of the Negroes. And at this sight they were glad indeed, and\r\nwould have landed at once, but they found the sea so rough upon that\r\ncoast that by no manner of means could they accomplish their purpose.\r\nAnd some of those who were present said afterwards that it was clear\r\nfrom the smell that came off the land how good must be the fruits of\r\nthat country, for it was so delicious that from the point they reached,\r\nthough they were on the sea, it seemed to them that they stood in some\r\ngracious fruit garden ordained for the sole end of their delight. And if\r\nour men showed on their side a great desire of gaining the land, no less\r\ndid the natives of it show their eagerness to receive them into it; but\r\nof the reception they offered I do not care to speak, for according to\r\nthe signs they made to our men from the first, they did not intend to\r\nabandon the beach without very great loss to one side or the other. Now\r\nthe people of this green land[N141] are wholly black, and hence this is\r\ncalled Land of the Negroes, or Land of Guinea. Wherefore also the men\r\nand women thereof are called \"Guineas,\" as if one were to say \"Black\r\nMen.\" And when the men in the caravels saw the first palms and lofty\r\ntrees as we have related, they understood right well that they were\r\nclose to the river of Nile, at the point where it floweth into the\r\nwestern sea, the which river is there called the Senegal.[AQ] For the\r\nInfant had told them that in little more than 20 leagues after the\r\nsighting of those trees they should look out for the same river, for so\r\nhe had learnt from several of his Azanegue prisoners.[N142] And so, as\r\nthey were going along scanning the coast to see if they could discern\r\nthe river, they perceived before them, as it might be about two leagues\r\nof land measure, a certain colour in the water of the sea which was\r\ndifferent from the rest, for this was of the colour of mud. And they\r\nthought that this might arise from shoals, so they took their soundings\r\nfor the safety of their ships, but they found no difference in this\r\nplace from the others in which there was no such movement, and at this\r\nthey were all amazed, especially by the difference in colour. And it\r\nhappened that one of those who were throwing in the sounding lead, by\r\nchance and without any certain knowledge, put his hand to his mouth and\r\nfound the water sweet. \"Here we have another marvel,\" cried he to the\r\nothers, \"for this water is sweet;\" and at this they threw a bucket\r\nforthwith into the sea and put the water to the test, all drinking of it\r\nas a thing in which nothing was wanting to make it as good as possible.\r\n\"Of a surety,\" said they, \"we are near the river of Nile, for it seemeth\r\nthat this water belongeth to the same, and by its great might the stream\r\ndoth cut through the sea and so entereth into it.\"[N143] Thereat they\r\nmade signs to the other caravels, and all of them began to coast in and\r\nlook for the river, and they were not very long in arriving at the\r\nestuary.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AQ: Canaga.]\r\n\r\nAnd when they were close to its mouth, they let down their anchors on\r\nthe seaward side, and the crew of the caravel of Vicente Diaz launched\r\ntheir boat, and into it jumped as many as eight men, and among them was\r\nthat Esquire of Lagos called Stevam Affonso, of whom we have already\r\nspoken, and who afterwards died in [AR]Canary; he had undertaken a part\r\nof the armament of that caravel.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AR: Grand.]\r\n\r\nAnd as all the eight were going in the boat, one of them, looking out\r\ntowards the mouth of the river, espied the door of a hut, and said to\r\nhis companions: \"I know not how the huts of this land are built, but\r\njudging by the fashion of those I have seen before, that should be a hut\r\nthat I see before me, and I presume it belongs to fishing folk who have\r\ncome to fish in this stream. And if you think well, it seemeth to me\r\nthat we ought to go and land beyond that point, in such wise that we may\r\nnot be discovered from the door of the hut; and let some land, and\r\napproach from behind those sandbanks, and if any natives are lying in\r\nthe hut, it may be that they will take them before they are perceived.\"\r\nNow it appeared to the others that this was good advice, and so they\r\nbegan to put it into execution. And as soon as they reached the land,\r\nStevam Affonso leapt out, and five others with him, and they proceeded\r\nin the manner that the other had suggested. And while they were going\r\nthus concealed even until they neared the hut, they saw come out of it a\r\nnegro boy, stark naked, with a spear in his hand. Him they seized at\r\nonce, and coming up close to the hut, they lighted upon a girl, his\r\nsister, who was[AS] about eight years old. This boy the Infant\r\nafterwards caused to be taught to read and write, with all other\r\nknowledge that a Christian should have; and many Christians there be who\r\nhave not this knowledge as perfectly as he had, for he was taught the\r\nprayer of Pater Noster, and the Ave Maria, and the Articles of Faith,\r\nand the precepts of the Law,[AT] and the various works of mercy, and\r\nmany other things; so that some said of this youth that the Infant had\r\nbidden train him for a priest, with the purpose of sending him back to\r\nhis native land, there to preach the faith of Jesus Christ. But I\r\nbelieve that afterwards he died without ever reaching man's estate. So\r\nthose men entered into the hut, where they found a black shield made of\r\nhide, quite round in shape, a little larger than those used in that\r\ncountry, the which had in the middle of it a boss of the same hide as\r\nthe shield itself, to wit, of an elephant's ear, as was afterwards\r\nlearnt from certain Guineas who saw it; for they said that they made all\r\ntheir shields of the hide of that animal, and that they found it so much\r\nthicker than was necessary[AU] that they cut off from it more than half,\r\nlessening it with devices they had made for this purpose. And the same\r\nmen said, moreover, that the size of the elephants was so great that the\r\nflesh of one would make a good meal for 2,500 men, and that this meat\r\nthey reckoned among themselves to be very good, and that they made no\r\nuse of the tusks, but threw them away; and I learnt that in the East of\r\nthis part of the Mediterranean Sea[N144] the tusks of one of those\r\nelephants were well worth 1,000 doubloons. And when they had captured\r\nthose young prisoners and articles of plunder, they took them forthwith\r\nto their boat. \"Well were it,\" said Stevam Affonso to the others, \"if we\r\nwere to go through this country near here, to see if we can find the\r\nfather and mother of these children, for, judging by their age and\r\ndisposition, it cannot be that the parents would leave them and go far\r\noff.\" The others said that he should go, with good luck, wherever he\r\npleased, for there was nothing to prevent them following him. And after\r\nthey had journeyed a short way, Stevam Affonso began to hear the blows\r\nof an axe, or of some other iron instrument, with which some one was\r\ncarpentering upon a piece of timber, and he stopped a little to assure\r\nhimself of what he had heard, and put the others into the same\r\nattention. And then they all recognised that they were near what they\r\nsought. \"Now,\" said he, \"do you come behind and allow me to go in front,\r\nbecause, if we all move forward in company, however softly we walk, we\r\nshall be discovered without fail, so that ere we come at him, whosoever\r\nhe be, if alone, he must needs fly and put himself in safety; but if I\r\ngo softly and crouching down, I shall be able to capture him by a sudden\r\nsurprise without his perceiving me; but do not be so slow of pace that\r\nyou will come late to my aid, where perhaps I may be in such danger as\r\nto need you.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AS: Lit., would be.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AT: Of God.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AU: For a shield.]\r\n\r\nAnd they agreeing to this, Stevam Affonso began to move forward; and\r\nwhat with the careful guard that he kept in stepping quietly, and the\r\nintentness with which the Guinea laboured at his work, he never\r\nperceived the approach of his enemy till the latter leapt upon him. And\r\nI say leapt, since Stevam Affonso was of small frame and slender, while\r\nthe Guinea was of quite different build; and so he[AV] seized him\r\nlustily by the hair, so that when the Guinea raised himself erect,\r\nStevam Affonso remained hanging in the air with his feet off the ground.\r\nThe Guinea was a brave and powerful man, and he thought it a reproach\r\nthat he should thus be subjected by so small a thing. Also he wondered\r\nwithin himself what this thing could be; but though he struggled very\r\nhard, he was never able to free himself, and so strongly had his enemy\r\nentwined himself in his hair, that the efforts of those two men could be\r\ncompared to nothing else than a rash and fearless hound who has fixed on\r\nthe ear of some mighty bull. And, to speak truth, the help that the rest\r\nof the company were to render to Stevam Affonso seemed to be rather\r\ntardy, so that I believe that his heart had quite repented him of his\r\nfirst purpose. And if at this point there had been room for a bargain, I\r\nknow he would have deemed it profitable to leave his gain to secure\r\nhimself from loss. But while those two were in their struggle, Affonso's\r\ncompanions came upon them, and seized the Guinea by his arms and neck in\r\norder to bind him. And Stevam Affonso, thinking that he was now taken\r\ninto custody and in the hands of the others, let go of his hair;\r\nwhereupon, the Guinea, seeing that his head was free, shook off the\r\nothers from his arms, flinging them away on either side, and began to\r\nflee. And it was of little avail to the others to pursue him, for his\r\nagility gave him a great advantage over his pursuers in running, and in\r\nhis course he took refuge in a wood full of thick undergrowth; and while\r\nthe others thought they had him, and sought to find him, he was already\r\nin his hut, with the intention of saving his children and taking his\r\narms, which he had left with them. But all his former toil was nothing\r\nin comparison of the great grief which came upon him at the absence of\r\nhis children, whom he found gone--but as there yet remained for him a\r\nray of hope, and he thought that perchance they were hidden somewhere,\r\nhe began to look towards every side to see if he could catch any glimpse\r\nof them. And at this appeared Vicente Diaz, that trader who was the\r\nchief captain of that caravel to which the boat belonged wherein the\r\nothers had come on land. And it appears that he, thinking that he was\r\nonly coming out to walk along the shore, as he was wont to do in Lagos\r\ntown, had not troubled to bring with him any arms except a boat-hook.\r\nBut the Guinea, as soon as he caught sight of him, burning with rage as\r\nyou may well imagine, made for him with right good will.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AV: Affonso.]\r\n\r\nAnd although Vicente Diaz saw him coming on with such fury, and\r\nunderstood that for his own defence it were well he had somewhat better\r\narms, yet thinking that flight would not profit him, but rather do him\r\nharm in many ways, he awaited his enemy without shewing him any sign of\r\nfear. And the Guinea rushing boldly upon him, gave him forthwith a wound\r\nin the face with his assegai, with the which he cut open the whole of\r\none of his jaws; in return for this the Guinea received another wound,\r\nthough not so fell a one as that which he had just bestowed. And because\r\ntheir weapons were not sufficient for such a struggle, they threw them\r\naside and wrestled; and so for a short space they were rolling one over\r\nthe other, each one striving for victory. And while this was proceeding,\r\nVicente Diaz saw another Guinea, one who was passing from youth to\r\nmanhood; and he came to aid his countryman; and although the first\r\nGuinea was so strenuous and brave and inclined to fight with such good\r\nwill as we have described, he could not have escaped being made prisoner\r\nif the second man had not come up: and for fear of him he[AW] now had to\r\nloose his hold of the first.[AX] And at this moment came up the other\r\nPortuguese, but the Guinea, being now once again free from his enemy's\r\nhands, began to put himself in safety with his companion, like men\r\naccustomed to running, little fearing the enemy who attempted to pursue\r\nthem. And at last our men turned back to their caravels, with the small\r\nbooty they had already stored in their boats.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AW: Diaz.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AX: The Guinea.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\n\r\nIn which the author relateth some things concerning the River of Nile.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeseemeth that since in this last chapter I have spoken of how our\r\ncaravels arrived at the river of Nile, I ought now to tell you something\r\nof its marvels, so that our Prince may receive the greater honour for\r\nhis mandate to our men to make booty upon the waters of the most noble\r\nriver of the world. And about the greatness of this river there are\r\nmarvellous testimonies, for these have spoken of it, to wit: Aristotle\r\nand Ptolemy, Pliny and Homer, Isidore, Lucan, and Paulus Orosius,[N145]\r\nand many other learned men; but not even they knew how to give a full\r\nrecital of its marvels. And in the first place, Paulus Orosius saith,\r\nthat the river appeareth to issue from the coast where the Red Sea\r\nbeginneth, at the point which the Greeks call Mossylon Emporion;[N146]\r\nand thence, he saith, it goeth towards the west and passeth through many\r\nlands, and maketh in the midst of its waters an isle called Meroë. And\r\nthis city is in the lordship of Ethiopia, in which Moses was by command\r\nof Pharaoh with all the power of Egypt, even as Josephus Rabanus[N147]\r\nand Master Peter write; and he saith that it was anciently called Saba,\r\nand, was the head of the kingdom of Ethiopia, but that after a long time\r\nCambyses, who was king of that land, gave to that city the name of\r\nMeroë,[N148] for love of one of his sisters, as Master Peter relateth.\r\nBut Master Gondolfo[N149] saith, in the ninth part of the book he wrote\r\ncalled _Pantheon_, that before it had that other name this place was\r\ncalled Nadabet, and that this was the first name the city had\r\nimmediately after its foundation. And so the Nile, winding at this\r\nisland, maketh its course toward the north, and thence turneth toward\r\nthe south,[AY] and according to the description that he[AZ] hath, it\r\noverfloweth its banks at certain times of the year, and watereth all the\r\nplains of Egypt.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AY: Lit., the midday.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AZ: Gondolfo.]\r\n\r\nBut Pliny relateth the story in another fashion, for he saith that the\r\nfounts whence riseth this river of Nile are not certainly known to any\r\nman, and that the river goeth for a very long way through desert\r\ncountries and through lands so hot that they would take fire and blaze\r\nup if it were not for the river; and he saith also that many have toiled\r\nmuch to get to the knowledge of the place where this stream doth rise,\r\nbut he who gained most knowledge of the same was the King Juba, who left\r\nit written that he had found that the river of Nile rose in a mountain\r\ncalled Atlas, which is in the land of Mauritania, at the furthest\r\nextremity of Africa towards the west, not very far from the great\r\nsea,[BA] and that it riseth from a fountain where it maketh a great pool\r\ncalled Nullidom, in which breed certain fish, some called _Allaltetes_,\r\nand others _Coracinus_, and others _Sillurus_; and it is said moreover\r\nthat the crocodiles breed there too.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BA: Atlantic.]\r\n\r\nAnd as to this, it is recounted that the inhabitants of the city of\r\nCaesarea,[BB] which is in that same land of Mauritania, took a\r\ncrocodile[N150] and put it in one of their temples called Eseo; and that\r\nfor many years it remained there in testimony that the said crocodiles\r\nwere to be found in that pool; and he relateth that it was found by some\r\nmen of that land who examined the matter, and found it well proved that,\r\naccording as it snowed and rained in the land of Mauritania, where that\r\nfountain is, in like manner rose or fell the Nile itself. And that after\r\nit issueth from that part and reacheth the land of the sands, it will\r\nnot run over the surface of those sands nor through places altogether\r\ndesert or miserable, but that it vanisheth there, and so floweth hidden\r\nbeneath the sand for the space of many days. And they say, too, that\r\nafter it arriveth at the other Mauritania Caesariensis, which is not a\r\nsandy land, it cometh up over the ground and there maketh another lake,\r\nin the which breed those same animals and creatures which breed in the\r\nother; and therefore men believe that all this water cometh from the\r\nNile, and that after it floweth out from there and cometh to the other\r\nsandy districts which are beyond Mauritania and towards Ethiopia, it\r\nagain disappeareth and runneth for the space of twenty days underground\r\ntill it is within the land of Ethiopia. And here again it cometh up\r\nabove the ground, showing clearly that it riseth from a fountain like\r\nthat other in Mauritania, which is called Nigris, where also breed the\r\nsame animals and other things that we have described before.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BB: Cherchel.]\r\n\r\nAnd thenceforth it[BC] runneth ever above ground without any more hiding\r\nof itself beneath the soil, and parteth Africa from Ethiopia, and maketh\r\ngreat lakes from the which the men of that country derive their\r\nmaintenance; and in the same way are to be found there all the creatures\r\nwhich breed in the other places of the said river. And from the place\r\nwhere it beginneth to run above ground without again taking its course\r\nsubterranean, down to the place where it commenceth to divide itself, it\r\nis called Niger; and in this part its stream is already very great, and\r\nhere it maketh of itself three parts, each one of which is a river by\r\nitself. And of these three rivers, one entereth Ethiopia and divideth\r\nthe same in the middle, and this is called Astapus, that is to say,\r\naccording to the language of that land, a water that runneth out of\r\ndarkness. And this river watereth many islands which are so great that,\r\nin passing by the smallest of them, though it runneth in its course very\r\nbriskly, it doth consume five days. But the noblest of these islands is\r\nthat called Meroë, which we have named above; and the second branch of\r\nthese three is that called Astaboras,[BD] the which in their language is\r\nas much as to say \"an arm of the water which cometh out of darkness,\"\r\nand this taketh its course towards the left; the third of these three is\r\ncalled Astusapes, which meaneth \"the water of the lake,\" and this also\r\nfloweth towards the left; and these streams, so far as they flow\r\nseparately, are called by these names that we have given. But when they\r\nare all joined together in one river, the stream taketh its own proper\r\nname, to wit, \"the Nile;\" but it is not called so before, though all\r\nthese streams be one water. And when it leaveth the islands, it shutteth\r\nitself up in certain mountains, but in no part doth it flow so angrily\r\nand with such a rushing stream as when it cometh to a place of Ethiopia\r\ncalled Catadupia,[BE] and thenceforth its bed is strewn with many great\r\nrocks for a long space. And these break it in its course, and the river\r\ngoeth dashing through those rocks and maketh a very great noise\r\ntherewith: so much so, that the learned say that no pregnant women dare\r\ndwell within two leagues of the same, in that the terror caused by this\r\nnoise straightway maketh them to miscarry.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BC: The Nile.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BD: Astabores.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BE: The Cataracts.]\r\n\r\nAnd coming forth from that multitude of great rocks, the strength of the\r\nwaters is now broken, and the stream floweth as if wearied, and the\r\ncurrent of the water is very gentle. And as soon as it entereth the\r\nplains of Egypt, it divideth many islands which have other names than\r\nthose they used to have; and thence it maketh its way directly to the\r\nsea; but before that it formeth many lakes and marshes by which are\r\nwatered all the plains of Egypt; and thereafter the river entereth the\r\nsea in one stream near the city which is called Damietta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\n\r\nOf the might of the Nile according to the Astronomers, and of its\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat man could decide the great contention there is among the learned\r\nconcerning the source and power of this river: for Alexander, who was\r\nthe most powerful of the Kings, to whom the province of Memphis in Egypt\r\nmade prayer, conceived a grudge against the Nile, for that he was not\r\nable to learn the truth of the aforesaid source, though he was lord of\r\nthe world. And this covetousness was not only in him, but it was also\r\nfound among the Kings of Egypt, and of Persia, and of Macedonia, and of\r\nGreece. But we will here describe in some small measure the course of\r\nthis river, according to the Astronomers, who say that Mercury is the\r\nsource of power over the waters, and that he hath influence over them;\r\nand that when he is in that part of the heaven where the stars of the\r\nsign of Leo are in conjunction with the stars of the sign of Cancer, or\r\nwith the star Sirius, to wit, that which is called the Dog\r\nstar,[BF][N151] whence those days are called the Dog days, he poureth\r\nout flames full of fury from his mouth, and altereth thereby the circle\r\nof the year, and the weather also changeth, for then the summer endeth\r\nand autumn beginneth. And again, when the signs of Capricorn and Cancer\r\nare in conjunction, under which the outflow of the Nile is hidden, and\r\nwhen the star of Mercury is in conjunction with those signs, Mercury\r\nbeing lord of the waters, striketh on the mouths, that is to say, in\r\nthose parts through which the Nile floweth, being under the fire of his\r\nconstellation; then the Nile openeth its fount and floweth forth; and\r\neven as the sea waxeth with the waxing of the moon, so riseth the Nile\r\nas if Mercury commanded it, and increaseth till it covereth the land\r\nwhence Egypt hath all its principal nutriment. And it doth not gather\r\nits waters together, nor return into its bed until the night hath as\r\nmany hours as the day. And in old time there were some who said that the\r\nrising of this stream was chiefly because of the snows of Ethiopia, but\r\nthis we find is not so, for the north doth not look upon those mountains\r\nof Ethiopia; no, not any one of the Bears of either pole, to wit, Ellice\r\nand Cynosure,[N152] neither the greater nor the less, which bring the\r\nchill and are the cause of snows and frosts; nor doth the north-east\r\nwind,[BG] which bringeth the frost with it.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BF: Canicolla.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BG: Blow upon these mountains.]\r\n\r\nAnd of this there is a good and sufficient testimony in the very colour\r\nof that same people of Ethiopia, whose blood is burnt by the great heat\r\nof the sun, which there hath the full power of its heat, and the breath\r\nof the south-west wind,[BH] which is the hottest of all winds; whence\r\nthe men of that land have their colour exceeding black; and moreover, no\r\nriver, whatever it be, that swelleth for reason of the snow or ice that\r\nhath recourse to it, is augmented except from the time of the entry of\r\nthe summer season; for then the snow and ice begin to melt by reason of\r\nthe heat; but the Nile doth not raise its waters so high, nor do they\r\nswell in its bed before the rising of that same Dog Star, nor do its\r\nwaters reach outwards to their banks until the day is equal to the\r\nnight, which is in the month of September, when the sun entereth into\r\nthe sign of Libra. From all which it appeareth clearly that the Nile\r\ndoth not follow the rule of any other waters; but when the sky becometh\r\ndistempered in the midst of the great heat of the sun, the Nile issueth\r\nforth with the swelling of its waters, and this is under the belt of the\r\nmid-day, which is scorching hot.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BH: Aurego.]\r\n\r\nAnd this it doth that the flame of the axis of the firmament, by reason\r\nof its increase, may not set fire to the land and burn it. And so the\r\nNile is as it were a succour to the world, because when the mouth of Leo\r\nis kindled, and when Cancer burneth over its city of Syene in Egypt,\r\nthen riseth this river against the mouths of the twain, to temper their\r\nfire, the which is a matter of the utmost need to the peoples of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nAnd so it spreadeth its waters over the land, not to return to its bed\r\ntill the sun shall have come to the time of autumn and lessened its\r\nstrength, when the shadows begin to fall in the city of Meroe, where the\r\ntrees cast no shadows in summer time, so directly passeth the sun[N153]\r\noverhead above everything. And so, in conclusion, to the great might of\r\nthe Nile we may apply those words wherewith Bishop Achoreus spake of it\r\nto Caesar, as Lucan writeth: \"Oh,\" said he, \"great and mighty stream,\r\nwhich risest from the midst of the axis of the firmament, and venturest\r\nto raise thy waters over their banks against the sign of Cancer when\r\nthat is in the fulness of its heat; thou who proceedest straight towards\r\nthe north-east with thy waters, and takest thy course through the midst\r\nof the plain; thou who turnest thence to the west and again to the east;\r\nthou who dost reveal thyself sometimes in Arabia and sometimes in the\r\nsands of Libya, displaying thyself to the peoples of those lands,\r\nperforming so many great benefits for them--of a truth the men of those\r\nregions could not dispense with thee or live without thee, and these are\r\nthe first races of men that behold thee. Thy power is to issue forth at\r\nthe solstices, the which do fall, the one in December and the other in\r\nJune, and thou increasest in the alien winter which is not thine. To\r\nthee is it granted by nature to go through both the axes of the\r\nfirmament, to wit: the axis of the north and that of the south; thy foam\r\nfighteth with the stars, so high dost thou cause it to rise by thy\r\npower; and before thy waves do all things tremble. What can I say of\r\nthee, except that thou art as it were the navel of the world: for even\r\nas the creatures which lie in the wombs of their mothers are governed by\r\nthe navels of their bodies, a like comparison may be made of thy\r\ngreatness in affairs of the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII.\r\n\r\nHow the Caravels set forth from the river, and of the voyage which they\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these secrets and marvels did the genius of our prince bring before\r\nthe eyes of the people of our kingdom, for although all the matters here\r\nspoken of concerning the marvels of the Nile[N154] could not be\r\nwitnessed by his own eyes, for that were impossible, it was a great\r\nmatter that his ships arrived there, where 'tis not recorded that any\r\nother ship of these parts had ever come. And this may truthfully be\r\naffirmed according to the matters which at the beginning of this book I\r\nhave related concerning the passage of Cape Bojador, and also from the\r\nastonishment which the natives of that land showed when they saw the\r\nfirst ships, for they went to them imagining they were fish, or some\r\nother natural product of the sea.[N155] But now returning to our\r\nhistory, after that deed was thus concluded, it was the wish of all the\r\nthree captains to endeavour to make an honourable booty, adventuring\r\ntheir bodies in whatsoever peril might be necessary; but it appeareth\r\nthat the wind veered sharply round to south, wherefore it was convenient\r\nto set sail at once. And as they were cruising up and down in order to\r\nsee what the weather purposed to do, the wind turned to the north, and\r\nwith this they made their way towards Cape Verde, where Dinis Diaz had\r\nbeen the other year. And they went on as far as was possible for all the\r\ncaravels to join them, except that of Rodrigueannes de Travaços, which\r\nlost its company and made thereafter that voyage which will be related.\r\n\r\nAnd the five caravels being directly over against the Cape, saw an\r\nisland, where they landed to see if it were peopled; they found that it\r\nwas deserted, only they discovered there a great multitude of she goats.\r\nAnd of these they took some to refresh themselves withal; and they\r\nreported that these were in no way different from the goats of our\r\ncountry, except that their ears were larger. From the same island also\r\nthey took water and went on further, until they found another island, in\r\nthe which they saw fresh skins of goats and other things, from which\r\nthey understood that other caravels had gone on in front of them; and in\r\nfurther proof of this they found the Arms of the Infant carved upon the\r\ntrees, and also the letters which composed his motto. \"Of a surety I\r\ndoubt,\" saith our author, \"if since the great power of Alexander and of\r\nCæsar, there hath been any prince in the world that ever had the marks\r\nof his conquest set up so far from his own land.\"\r\n\r\nAnd by those signs, which those men of the caravels found there on the\r\ntrees, they understood that some others had already gone on in front,\r\nand so they decided to turn back to their ships; and, as they afterwards\r\ndiscovered, it was the caravel of John Gonçalves Zarco, captain of the\r\nisle of Madeira, that had preceded them.\r\n\r\nAnd because there were so many of those blacks[BI] on land that by no\r\nmeans could they disembark either by day or night, Gomez Pirez sought to\r\nshow that he desired to go among them on peaceful terms, and so placed\r\nupon the shore a cake and a mirror and a sheet of paper on which he drew\r\na cross. And the natives when they came there and found those things,\r\nbroke up the cake and threw it far away, and with their assegais they\r\ncast at the mirror, till they had broken it in many pieces, and the\r\npaper they tore, showing that they cared not for any of these things.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BI: Guineas.]\r\n\r\n\"Since it is so,\" said Gomez Pirez to his crossbowmen, \"shoot at them\r\nwith your bows that they may at least understand that we are people who\r\ncan do them hurt, whenever they will not agree to a friendly\r\nunderstanding.\" But the blacks seeing the others' intention, began to\r\npay them back, launching at them also their arrows and assegais, some of\r\nwhich our men brought home to this kingdom. And the arrows are so made\r\nthat they have no feathers, nor a notch for the string to enter, but\r\nthey are all smooth and short, and made of rushes or reeds, and their\r\niron points are long and some are made of wood fixed in the shafts,\r\nwhich are like the iron spindles with which the women of this country\r\nspin. And they use also other little harpoons of iron, the which darts\r\nare all equally poisoned with plants. And their assegais are each made\r\nwith seven or eight harpoon-like prongs, and the plant they use is very\r\nvenomous.\r\n\r\nAnd in that island in which the arms of the Infant[N156] were carved\r\nthey found trees of great size, and of strange forms, and among these\r\nwas one which was not less than 108 palms in circuit at the foot. And\r\nthis tree[N157] doth not grow very high, but is about as lofty as the\r\nwalnut-tree, and from its middle bark they make very good thread for\r\ncordage, and it burneth like flax. The fruit is like a gourd, and its\r\nseeds are like filberts, and this fruit they eat green, and the seeds\r\nthey dry. And of these there is a great abundance, and I believe they\r\nuse them for their maintenance after the green faileth them. And some\r\nthere were who said they saw there birds which appeared to them to be\r\nparrots.\r\n\r\nSo all the captains there agreed to make sail, with the intention of\r\nentering into the River of Nile, but no one was able to light upon it\r\nsave Lawrence Diaz, that squire of the Infant's. And he, because he was\r\nalone, did not dare enter into the river, but he went with the little\r\nboat to the place where they took the blacks on the outward voyage;\r\nhowbeit he turned back without doing anything worthy of mention. And\r\nsince he did not fall in with the convoy again he came straight to\r\nLagos. And in this wise Gomez Pirez lost the company of the other\r\ncaravels; and following his course towards Portugal, after taking in\r\nwater at the isle of Arguim, he came to the Rio do Ouro,[N158] and\r\nsailed as far up as the port where he had been the preceding year with\r\nAntam Gonçalvez and Diego Affonso, and there presently the Moors came,\r\nand in taking security of them he learnt there were no merchants there.\r\nBut they sold him a black for the price of five doubloons, which he paid\r\nthem by certain things he gave them in their stead. Also they brought\r\nhim water on their camels, and gave him meat and made him a sufficiency\r\nof good reception; and above all they showed such confidence that\r\nwithout any hesitancy so many entered into the caravel, that he was not\r\nvery well pleased, and would not consent that any more should enter; but\r\nat last, without causing them[BJ] any injury, he had them put on land,\r\nmaking an agreement with them that next year, in the month of July, he\r\nwould return there, when he would find blacks in abundance, and gold,\r\nand merchandise by which he might gain much profit. Moreover, Gomez\r\nPirez brought back from that voyage a great many skins of sea-calves,\r\nwith the which he loaded his ship and so returned to the kingdom.[N159]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BJ: The blacks.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV.\r\n\r\nOf how Lançarote and Alvaro de Freitas captured a dozen Moors.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt were unreasonable in our account of these caravels not to return to\r\nthe place whereto we took them first; and since we have now described\r\nthe return of some of them to the kingdom, we would recount the fortune\r\nof the rest, and we will speak at once of Lançarote and of Alvaro de\r\nFreitas. And it was so, that while Vicente Diaz was with both these\r\ncaptains--and I mean that same Vicente Diaz who, as we have said\r\nalready, was wounded by the Guinea upon the shore of the Nile--by chance\r\nhe was parted from the company of the others; and inasmuch as it was\r\nnight, he was not able to return very quickly to his friends. But while\r\nwe leave him pursuing his way alone, it is fit that we should speak of\r\nthe achievements of the others. Now they were not well content with the\r\nbooty they had taken, and both of them determined to toil for the\r\nincrease of their first gain, and so pursuing their way towards Tider,\r\nfor there they thought they might yet light upon some matter of which\r\nthey could make booty, they came to the point of Tira. And here they\r\nspake with their company, and said: that as they knew the land was\r\npeopled, it seemed good to them that they should go out of their ships\r\nand land and strive to see if they could obtain any gain. And on this\r\nmotion there was no discussion, but all said they would do as it pleased\r\nhim, for they well knew that they had such captains that none but\r\nprofitable counsel could come from them.\r\n\r\nThe boats were at once made ready, and the captains embarked in them\r\nwith their men, leaving the caravels guarded as was proper. And of those\r\nwho were in the boats they disembarked some who were to go on by land;\r\nand the others, who remained in the boats, made their way under shelter\r\nof the land. And while both the one and the other party were going on\r\ntheir way, those on shore said that they had lighted on a track of men\r\nwho had passed by that way, and also the track seemed to them to be\r\nfresh, and in it they discovered the footprints of women and children.\r\n\r\n\"Then let us follow after these,\" said the captains, \"for since the\r\ntrack is so fresh it must be that they who made it are not very far\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as they had a good will for this action, and the track was clearly\r\nto be seen, they were led on a very great distance, but they could not\r\nyet spy the Moors they sought; so that some there were who said that so\r\ndistant an expedition was beyond reason and that they ought to turn\r\nback. But the others, more vehement in their covetousness for gain, did\r\nnot pay any heed to the words of the former, and pursued their way none\r\nthe less.\r\n\r\nAnd as they went forward, not very far from there, while traversing a\r\nsandhill, they saw the Moors, who were journeying in a hollow. \"Now,\"\r\nsaid those who there bore the office of captains, to these others, \"you\r\ncan show your good will by toiling in the pursuit of those foemen.\" And\r\nalthough our men were already somewhat wearied, it appeared to them as\r\nif they had only that moment issued from their ships, so great desire\r\nhad they to come up with the enemy. And this desire they now put into\r\npractice very quickly, for the Moors were hardly able to issue forth\r\nbefore our men were up with them; and some, that endeavoured to offer a\r\ndefence, in a brief space learnt the error of their sect, for without\r\nany pity our men killed them very speedily, in so much that there\r\nremained alive no more than twelve, whom they took back as their\r\nprisoners. And although the booty was not great in comparison of other\r\nspoil which had already been made in that land, yet were they all very\r\nglad of it; and this because the victory had been obtained by so few men\r\nrather than because of the share of gain that fell to the lot of each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV.\r\n\r\nHow Lançarote and Alvaro de Freitas and Vicente Diaz took fifty-seven\r\nMoors.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo having obtained that booty, small as it was, the captains made\r\nagreement to go straight to the Isle of Arguim, there to take in the\r\nwater they needed, and to discuss the future of the voyage. And arriving\r\nat the said island--which they had first reconnoitred for the sake of\r\nsecurity--as soon as they ascertained that the Isle was free from\r\nenemies, they all landed. And after they had taken a little rest they\r\nlaid in their water, which gave them a singular pleasure, for one of the\r\nchief refreshments in which maritime folk delight, after they have been\r\nsome time at sea, is good water, whenever they can obtain it. And so\r\nreposing there that night, on the next day, while they were on the point\r\nof holding a council, one began to say that it appeared to him that he\r\nsaw a sail coming towards them, and when all looked in that direction\r\nthey perceived it was a caravel. And this they supposed to be the ship\r\nof Vicente Diaz, which a little time before had parted company with\r\nthem; and for this reason they put off their council, because they\r\nsought that all should join in it.\r\n\r\nAnd when the caravel had come up to them, they asked Vicente Diaz to be\r\nso good as to land and take part in that council of theirs. \"My\r\nfriends,\" said he, \"you will have patience till my people can take\r\nrefreshment with the water of this island, for we have come here with a\r\ngreat desire for it.\" And having finished their refreshment, they began\r\ntheir council; and herein the captains put forward that their intent was\r\nto endeavour to make some further booty, for as to returning with so\r\nsmall a profit, that would be a reproach for persons such as they were.\r\n\r\n\"Friends,\" said some, \"your proposal would be good if the place were\r\nsuch that by toiling one might hope to receive some profit; but this\r\nland, as you know, is already turned upside down, and it hath been\r\ndisturbed a thousand times, and the caravels go by it every day, so that\r\nthere is not a Moor, however simple he may be, that dareth to set foot\r\non all this land; but rather reason teacheth that they must have been\r\nterrified and fled from here as far as they could. Wherefore it\r\nappeareth to us that it would be well to content ourselves with the\r\nbooty we have, and that we should make our voyage straightway to our own\r\nkingdom and not waste time in a matter which we so plainly know to be\r\nimpossible of profit for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Truth it is,\" said others, \"that this land hath been roused even as you\r\nsay, wherefore one of two things must needs be: Either the Moors are\r\nvery far from here; or if they are here they will be so prepared as to\r\nbe able to await any hostile attack that may be made upon them without\r\nfear, so that where we look for a capture they perchance may take us.\r\nAnd even if we pay heed to nothing else, consider what happened to the\r\ncaravels of Lisbon, for they having obtained a cargo with which they\r\ncould have very reasonably returned, sought to put all to the hazard of\r\na venture, the result of which was as you have heard.\"\r\n\r\nThe third opinion, which was that of the captains and of some of the\r\npicked men, was delayed a little, but they maintained nevertheless, that\r\nthe landing was not to be given up. \"You know,\" said they, \"how in the\r\nisle of Tider[N160] were killed some Moors and others were taken, so\r\nthat they cannot be counted at their former number, and the remainder\r\nare half conquered, for as you saw they fled before the points of our\r\nlances, as people who did not dare to try their strength against ours.\r\nBut let us go and see if we can light upon any there, for if they are\r\nthere it cannot be but that either of their flesh or their wool we shall\r\ntake some quantity. And if perchance the island is now void of\r\ninhabitants, we can then give sure news of this to the Infant our lord;\r\nand from this it would appear that our expedition was not without great\r\nprofit, since the Moors were not content to fly from us once, but with\r\nthe fear of us had altogether abandoned their huts and the land where\r\nthey were born and lived.\"\r\n\r\nFirmly stood by this opinion most of the chief men; yet the lower people\r\nnevertheless desired that no other matter should be undertaken, but that\r\nthey should turn back to the kingdom. Howbeit they had to agree to the\r\nopinion of those who were worth more and understood better than they;\r\nand so they began presently to start on their expedition, and before\r\nnight fell they arrived off the island, where they dropped their\r\nanchors, though not very close to it, and stayed there until they saw\r\nthe sun had finished his daily toil.\r\n\r\nThen when the sky was covered by the shades of night, they launched\r\ntheir boats and embarked in them and stationed themselves at the arm of\r\nthe sea which ran on the land side, though in front of the said land\r\nthere is another island called Cerina.[N161] And so they landed on\r\nTider, but did not find anyone, wherefore they turned back and retired\r\nto their boats and went forward so far that it was already sun rise.\r\n\r\nAnd Lançarote issued forth from the side of Cerina and went along by\r\nland, ordering the boats to make their way by water; and when they saw\r\nthat they found nothing, Lançarote said to the others that it would be\r\nwell to go forward to a certain promontory, and all agreed with him. And\r\nwhile seeking to prepare themselves and to gather themselves together\r\nfor starting, Lançarote heard an ass bray.\r\n\r\n\"Meseemeth,\" said he to the others, \"I hear the bray of an ass, as\r\nthough some pleasure were in store for us; for perchance it is God's\r\nwill that we should not depart hence without booty.\" And because there\r\nwas no doubt of what he had heard, he told them to await him there, and\r\nthat he would go upon some sandhills to see what that could be. And\r\nwhile the others were waiting, he mounted up the sandhills, and from\r\nthere looking round on all sides he saw the Moors where they stood, many\r\nmore in number than our men. And these Moors were getting ready their\r\nasses and gathering up their baggage, as men who sought to leave that\r\nplace, with little care of what in a few hours would overtake them.\r\nTruth it is that they were endeavouring to set out, but they deemed not\r\nit was upon so long a journey.\r\n\r\nBut Lançarote, as soon as he had seen them, descended very quietly from\r\nthe place where he was, and came and gave the news to the others, and\r\nyou know well how glad they would be when they heard it. \"Now, God be\r\npraised,\" said he, \"we have what we sought. The Moors are here, just\r\nready to move away. They are more in number than we: if you will only\r\nlabour the victory is ours. Strengthen your hearts and make your feet\r\nswift, for on the first encounter will depend the whole of our victory.\"\r\n\r\nIt were impossible to tell how great was the exultation then felt by\r\nall, for scarcely had Lançarote finished these words of his when all\r\nmoved off at a run. Yet so well did they do this that they moved without\r\nnoise till they were upon the sandhills, but when they arrived there\r\nthey were not able to control their desires that urged them to cry out.\r\nAnd when they appeared over against the Moors they lifted up their\r\nvoices, the which were not a whit less than the strength of each one\r\navailed; and when the Moors heard these they were very much affrighted\r\nand disordered. And now our men began to run forward, shouting out their\r\naccustomed cries, to wit, \"St. James,\" \"Portugal,\" \"St. George;\" but the\r\nsound of these was not very pleasant to the enemy, so that they had not\r\nleisure to place their pack-saddles upon their asses. And those who had\r\nthe packs upon their necks freed themselves from these burdens, and what\r\nwas more noteworthy, some who had their children upon their shoulders,\r\nseeing that they could not save them, let them fall upon the ground,\r\nwith how great a crash you may imagine. And so in this anguish they\r\nbegan to fly, not all together, nor by one road, but each one by\r\nhimself, quite leaving behind their women and children, without any hope\r\nof remedy. Yet true it is that some there were, who though they\r\nperceived the manifest discomfiture of their party, had the courage to\r\nshow some defence, the which were very quickly despatched from life. And\r\nfinally of all the people there were taken fifty-seven; some others were\r\nkilled and again others escaped. Oh, if only among those who fled there\r\nhad been some little understanding of higher things. Of a surety I\r\nbelieve, that the same haste which they showed in flying, they would\r\nthen have made in coming to where they might have saved their souls and\r\nrestored their affairs in this life. For although it might appear to\r\nthem that, living as they were, they were living in freedom, their\r\nbodies really lay in much greater captivity, considering the nature of\r\nthe country and the bestiality of their life, than if they were living\r\namong us under an alien rule, and this all the more because of the\r\nperdition of their souls, a matter which above all others should have\r\nbeen perceived by them.\r\n\r\nOf a surety, although their bodily eyes did not perceive any part of\r\nthis good fortune of theirs,[BK] yet the eyes of the understanding, to\r\nwit of the soul pure and clean with unending glory, having received in\r\nthis world the holy sacraments, and departed from this life with some\r\nlittle portion of faith, would quickly be able to recognise the former\r\nerror of their blindness.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BK: In being taken captive.]\r\n\r\nHere did those three caravels make an end of that voyage and turned\r\nthemselves back to the kingdom, not a little content with the advantage\r\nthey perceived they had gained over the others their comrades in this\r\nmeeting with their latest booty.\r\n\r\nBut now let us speak of those who are still at sea, in order to give you\r\nan account of their whole achievement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI.\r\n\r\nHow Rodrigueannes and Dinis Diaz joined company.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am right sorry that in this history I cannot keep that order which\r\nreason demandeth, because the matter of the said history was so treated\r\nthat many times it is necessary for me to make a chapter where else I\r\ncould pass on with two words as at this present. For now, in order to\r\njoin the caravel of Rodrigueannes with that of Dinis Diaz, it behoveth\r\nme to make a new rubric. Now these caravels having separated from the\r\ncompany of the others, went on seeking for them, and came together in so\r\ndoing. And seeing how that of the other company they were not able to\r\nlearn any more, the two then sailed together: but of what afterwards\r\nhappened to them we will speak further on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII.\r\n\r\nHow the five caravels returned to the kingdom, and of what they did\r\nbeforehand.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, as we have already said in our former chapters, these matters\r\nhappened according as fortune gave them to happen. And in order that I\r\nmay return with all the caravels to Lagos as I have promised, and as it\r\nis necessary, I desire in this present chapter to speak of those five,\r\nwhich separated themselves from the company of the rest after the\r\ninvasion of the isle of Tider. For there was that honourable knight\r\nSueiro da Costa, alcayde of Lagos, and four other captains, neighbours\r\nand natives of that place; and they, having agreed to turn back, as we\r\nhave said, discussed among themselves the prosecution of their voyage,\r\nas it appeared to them that their first booty was a small matter, though\r\nan honourable, in comparison of their great toil and expense.\r\n\r\n\"We are not able,\" said some, \"to alter our first opinion, in\r\ndetermining to make our return, both on account of the small size of our\r\nships, and that we may not seem to be men of many opinions. But it would\r\nbe well for us, nevertheless, to prosecute our voyage and try whether we\r\ncan, on our course, obtain anything by way of adding to our booty,\r\nthough in reason it must be little on account of the many visits which\r\nour ships have already made to this land. Still, we should not omit to\r\ntry, and peradventure God may give us some good result. But in order to\r\ndirect this matter with some foundation of reason, there is no other\r\nplace so fitting, and where our toil may have such good hope of victory,\r\nas that arm of the sea which is at Cape Branco, and into this we will\r\nenter and see whither it leadeth. And it may be that, if it entereth far\r\ninto the land, we may light on something near there of which we may make\r\nbooty: and if not, we need toil but little in that enterprise.\"\r\n\r\nAll agreed that what those first speakers had said was well spoken, and\r\nsailing in that direction they arrived at the said river. And herein\r\nentering a little space, they anchored their ships, and then letting\r\ndown their boats, they began to endeavour themselves to reach the end of\r\nthe river. And, following the course of this for four leagues, they\r\narrived at the end of it.[N162] And here they agreed to disembark to see\r\nif they could light upon any inhabited place where they could take some\r\nsouls to add to the scantiness of their first booty. But they doubted in\r\nthemselves of getting anything, as they knew that the land was prepared\r\nand had been so often invaded; only they toiled in this matter,\r\nconstrained at least by the need of telling their companions that they\r\nhad been on shore.\r\n\r\nAnd landing thus they sent on ahead to reconnoitre the land, but they\r\nhad not followed very far, when they saw before them a few huts. And\r\nupon these they rushed without waiting for any agreement, and there they\r\ncame upon some few Moors, of whom they captured eight.\r\n\r\nAnd seeking to learn from them if there were thereabouts any other\r\nsettlement, and to this end threatening some of them, they were not able\r\nto learn anything but that in all this land there was no other\r\nsettlement. And in this all the eight were agreed, after each one had\r\nbeen taken aside in turn. And for this reason it was needful for them to\r\nreturn to their ships, with the intention of now returning to their\r\nhomes, without spending any more trouble in the matter, since they\r\nunderstood that they could not gain any further profit by more toil. And\r\nin agreement with this decision were all the others who belonged to the\r\nCaravels, except only the Alcayde of Lagos, who said that he still\r\nwished to return to Tider in order to make ransom of a Mooress, and of\r\nthe son of a lord of that place. And although he was counselled to the\r\ncontrary, yet would he never abandon his design, howbeit afterwards he\r\nrepented of it sorely. And arriving at the island, he began to make\r\nsigns to the Moors, who had come down to the shore as soon as they saw\r\nthe caravel sailing towards them.\r\n\r\nAnd of them he had one Moor for his security while he surrendered the\r\nmaster of the caravel, and a Jew who was in his company. But when the\r\nMoors had them in their power, the Mooress, of whom the Alcayde sought\r\nto make the ransom, threw herself into the water, and like one practised\r\nin that kind of thing very quickly got to land and joined her relations\r\nand her friends. And on account of this the Moors considered that they\r\nought not to give up the hostages without an advantage over what they at\r\nfirst had purposed; and finally they refused to surrender those whom\r\nthey had until they[BL] should give them three Moors. Which matter,\r\nalthough it was a hard thing for the Alcayde to do, was yet condescended\r\nto by him, seeing the necessity of the case; howbeit he blamed himself\r\nin that he had not followed the first advice of his companions. And\r\nseeing how he could make no further profit in that ransom, he turned\r\nback to the Kingdom.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BL: The Portuguese.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\r\n\r\nHow the caravel of Alvaro Gonçalvez d'Atayde and that of Picanço and the\r\nother of Tavilla sailed in company, and of the Canarians that they\r\ncaptured.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have told in other chapters how the caravel of Tavilla and the other\r\nof Picanço parted company with the others when they went to Guinea,\r\nwhere it befell that they agreed together to return to Portugal. And on\r\ntheir return voyage they met with the caravel of Alvaro Gonçalvez\r\nd'Atayde, whose captain was one John de Castilha, and on asking him\r\nwhither he was going, he said that he was voyaging to Guinea. \"But,\"\r\nsaid the others, \"what availeth your going at such a time as this, for\r\nwe have just come from there, as you see, and winter is beginning, and\r\ntherefore if you pursue your journey further you will imperil your life\r\nand gain little honour and less profit; but if you think good to follow\r\nour advice, return with us and we will go to the island of Palma, and\r\nsee if we can make a capture of some of those Canarians there.\"\r\n\r\nAnd although John de Castilha had doubts about so returning, because it\r\ndid not appear to him a sure thing from the accounts he had heard of the\r\ninhabitants of that island, how that they were difficult to capture, yet\r\ncompelled by the reasons the others gave him, he had to return with\r\nthem. And so, going all in company, they arrived at the island of\r\nGomera, where, wishful to go on shore, they espied many Canarians, of\r\nwhom they took security before wholly leaving their boats. The Canarians\r\ngranted them this without any reluctance, like men whose wills were more\r\ninclined to do them service than to put difficulties in their way. And\r\nimmediately came there two chiefs of that island, who said how they were\r\nservants of the Infant Don Henry (and not without good reason, for they\r\nhad previously been in the house of the King of Castile and the King of\r\nPortugal), and how in neither of them had they met with the favours they\r\nafterwards received from the Infant Don Henry; for while they were in\r\nhis house they had from him a right excellent entertainment as long as\r\nthey stayed there; and, in short[BM] he had clothed them very well, and\r\nsent them in his ships to their own land, on which account they were\r\nvery ready to do him every service. \"But,\" said they of the caravels,\r\n\"we are also his men and servants, and by his command we left our\r\ncountry; wherefore if such is your mind, you have now the occasion of\r\nshowing it right well, for we would go to the island of Palma and essay\r\nto take some captives, in the which your assistance would be very useful\r\nto us, if you would send with us some of these your subjects to aid and\r\ndirect us, for we are unacquainted with the land, and have no knowledge\r\nof the ways of its inhabitants in their fighting.\" Now Bruco was the\r\nname of one of these chiefs, and the other's name was Piste, and they\r\nreplied together that they were well pleased to toil in any matter that\r\nwas for the service of the lord Infant Don Henry, and that they rendered\r\nmany thanks to God for giving them the opportunity of showing what a\r\ngood will they had for it; \"and that you may see,\" said Piste, \"the\r\ndesire I have to serve him, I will accompany you and bring with me as\r\nmany Canarians as you wish.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BM: They declared that.]\r\n\r\n\"It seemeth to me,\" saith the author, \"that the gratitude of these men\r\nbringeth shame on many who had received greater and better things from\r\nthis our Prince, and yet came not by a great way to so perfect a\r\nknowledge of it. Oh, what a dishonour for those who were brought up in\r\nhis household, and whom he afterwards placed in dignities and lordships,\r\nbut who, clean forgetful of this, deserted him when their service was of\r\nneed; and the names and deeds of these we will relate in the history of\r\nthe Kingdom when we come to speak of the siege of Tangier.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so that captain offered himself with his person and men, of whom he\r\nstraightway had embarked in the ships as many as the captains wished to\r\nreceive, and then they set sail forthwith, directing their course to the\r\nother Island of Palma, where they arrived when it was almost morning.\r\nAnd although reason would not have allowed them to land at such an hour,\r\nnevertheless they agreed together to go on shore forthwith. \"For,\" said\r\nthey, \"we have already been perceived, and if we wait at all, our booty\r\nwill be labour lost, for the Canarians will put themselves in safety,\r\nwhile if we land forthwith we shall be able to capture some; for\r\nalthough they are fleet of foot, yet there will be men among us that\r\nwill follow them; and for sure the owners of those flocks who are\r\nwandering there before our eyes, will hasten up and get them in, for it\r\nis their custom to take almost as much toil about them as on their own\r\nbehalf.\" And although such a resolve was perilous, yet it met with the\r\napproval of all of them; and so in a very short space they were all set\r\non shore, as well the Portuguese as the Canarians.[BN] And as they were\r\npursuing their way at no great distance from the beach, they perceived\r\nthat the Canarians[BO] were flying, and as they commenced to follow\r\nthem, one of the company said to the others: \"Wherefore undertake a vain\r\ntoil in running after those men? for however much you labour, you will\r\nnot be able to come up with them; but rather let us follow those ewes\r\nand rams which are going up that crag, for of a surety the most part of\r\nthose who are with them are youths and women, and if we follow them well\r\nwe are bound to capture some.\" And these words were scarcely finished\r\nwhen all our men began to run, leaving the other Canarians, whose track\r\nthey had already commenced to follow up. But those shepherds entered\r\nwith their flock into a valley so deep and so dangerous that it was\r\neasier to marvel at than to relate how any could make their passage\r\nthrough it.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BN: Who were friendly.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BO: Natives of Palma.]\r\n\r\nBut the Christians, both Portuguese and Canarians, followed them up with\r\nsuch zeal that just as the first began to enter into the valley, ours\r\nwere already nigh unto them, and so all together they entered the\r\nvalley, in such a way that the shepherds were obliged to take shelter\r\namong an expanse of rocky crags, the roughness of which was a marvellous\r\nthing; but much more marvellous was the ease with which the Canarians of\r\nthat island made their way among those rocks, as though in sucking the\r\nmilk from their mothers' breasts, they had commenced to walk in those\r\nplaces. And as the Psylli and Marmaridae,[BP] who live beyond the Libyan\r\ndesert, know their sons to be sprung from their own bodies if\r\nstraightway in their first boyhood they handle without fear the great\r\npoisons of that desert as they are offered to them by their fathers; so\r\nthe Canarians of this island consider that their sons, if they are not\r\nborn with this agility, have been generated by some wicked adultery.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BP: The text has \"Sillos ou Marmorios.\"]\r\n\r\nBut what about our countrymen, desirous to follow after them, for\r\nalthough they saw the roughness of the ground, yet they did not desist\r\nfrom pursuing them; and there a youth of noble heart, in running over\r\nthose rocks, slipped from a very large and rough crag, and falling down,\r\ndied. And think not that this misfortune happened only to that native of\r\nour realm, for many Canarians fell in the same way and died: for\r\nalthough Nature from old time had given them to walk among those rocky\r\nhills, yet on account of the haste of their enemies, whom they perceived\r\nto be near them, and deeming that to be their last remedy, where the\r\ncrags were roughest, thither with the better will they made their way,\r\nthinking that their foes would fear to pursue them.\r\n\r\nAnd if that Diego Gonçalvez, a page of the Infant's household (of whom I\r\nhave already spoken in the chapter where I related how he was the first\r\nto throw himself in and swim at the Island where they took the\r\nfifty-eight Moors), if he, I say, received praise for his excellent\r\ncourage, I may truthfully increase it much more on this occasion unto\r\nhim, as unto the man who before all others bore himself conspicuously on\r\nthat day. And certainly with great reason may I here blame fortune for\r\nthis youth, who had been rewarded by his lord the Infant with a recent\r\nmarriage in the City of Lisbon, and had collected in his house a great\r\nabundance of wealth for the sustaining of his life, when a fire came\r\nupon it by the negligence of a servitor of his. And this burned all the\r\nthings that he had, but fortune was so kindly to him that it left them\r\nsome poor garments with the which they escaped from the said house. The\r\ntoil of our men was great on that day, although not so much in the\r\nfighting. Yet that was perilous enough, especially on account of the\r\nmultitude of stones with which the Canarians chiefly combat their\r\nenemies, for they are strong in the arm, and very deadly with their\r\nshots. And it is right hard for any one else to strike them, for so well\r\ndo they know how to avoid blows, especially of anything thrown, that,\r\nmarksman though a man be, only after a long time and through great good\r\nfortune is he able to hit them. And they carry other arms well according\r\nwith their bestial mode of life, to wit, long lances with sharp horns at\r\nthe heads instead of iron points, and others sharpened like them at the\r\nlower ends.\r\n\r\nBut although the labour was so great, yet was it a beautiful thing to\r\nlook upon; for anyone who had seen their skirmish, so disordered and\r\nconfused, and in such a place--(the Christians engaged in capturing the\r\nCanarians and separating the flock from amongst them for the better\r\nsecuring of their booty, and the enemy busying themselves for the saving\r\nof their lives and of their flocks as best they could)--would say that\r\nsuch a sight was more delectable than any other that fell short of this\r\nending. And so the booty of that day was seventeen Canarians, what of\r\nmen and women, and among the latter they captured one who was of\r\nwondrous size for a woman, and they said that she was Queen of a part of\r\nthat island. And after they had collected together their prisoners and\r\nthe flock, they began to retreat towards their boats, but they were\r\nfollowed up by the Canarians so closely that they were obliged to leave\r\nthem the greater part of the flock they had taken from them, and owing\r\nto this our men had much toil in their retreating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX.\r\n\r\nHow they took certain Canarians, despite the surety.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when all were in their ships, they raised their sails and returned\r\nto the other island whence they had departed before; and because they\r\nhad received much help from those first Canarians whom they had with\r\nthem, they rendered great thanks to that Chief in the name of the Infant\r\ntheir lord for the toil that he had undergone for his service, and much\r\nmore for the goodwill with which he had undertaken it, putting him in\r\nthe hope of receiving for it many other and greater guerdons than those\r\nhe had received before. And of a surety their promise was not in vain,\r\nfor afterwards that Chief, who was called Piste came to this kingdom,\r\nwith others from that land, and they obtained many favours and much\r\nhospitality from the Infant, on account of which I can well believe they\r\ndid not repent of their former toil. And of this I, who collected and\r\nput in order this history, can be a sure witness; for it happened that I\r\nwas in the Kingdom of the Algarve in the house of this Prince[N163] at\r\nthe time when these Canarians were staying there, and I saw well how\r\nthey were treated. And I believe that that Chief, and some of those who\r\naccompanied him, stayed so long in this kingdom, that they made an end\r\nof their lives there. And I have said already how John de Castilha, who\r\nwas captain of that caravel of Alvaro Gonçalvez d'Atayde, did not arrive\r\nin Guinea as the others did, nor do I find that he made any other booty,\r\nbut only those Canarians which they took there; and this seemed to him a\r\nvery small thing with which to return to the Kingdom, especially as all\r\nthe other caravels had a great advantage over him which he in his heart\r\nfelt to be an injury. And so he imagined an ugly device by which he\r\nmight make some increase in that little which he was carrying, and he\r\nbegan to treat with the others that they would be pleased to seize some\r\npart of these Canarians in spite of the sureties. And as covetousness is\r\nthe root of all evils, though such a proceeding seemed devoid of reason\r\nto many, yet they had to consent to what John de Castilha on so many\r\ngrounds showed them to be profitable. And because it seemed to them an\r\nugly thing to take any of those men who had aided them so well, they\r\nmoved from that place and went to another port. And there some\r\nCanarians, trusting in our men, went to the caravel, and these, I\r\nbelieve, were twenty-one in number, and with them they made sail to\r\nPortugal. But the Infant, having knowledge of this, was very wroth with\r\nthose captains, and straightway he caused the Canarians to be brought to\r\nhis own house, and had them very nobly attired and returned to their own\r\nland. And there the natives bestowed much praise on the Prince for such\r\na virtuous act, and were on this account much the more inclined to serve\r\nhim. And of the first coming of these Canarians to this our Kingdom, and\r\nof many other things that passed concerning them, we will speak more\r\nfully in the general chronicle of the acts of our Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX.\r\n\r\nOf how Tristam of the Island[BQ] went towards Cape Branco.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already told how Tristam, one of the captains of the Island of\r\nMadeira, had armed a caravel to go in company with the others. And\r\nalthough he had a right good will to serve the Infant and much desired\r\nto profit himself (for he was abundantly covetous), yet such was his\r\nfortune that as soon as he passed Cape Branco, immediately the wind\r\nbecame contrary for him. And thereat he turned backwards; and although\r\nhe afterwards toiled hard to return and pursue his first way, yet never\r\nagain was he able to fill his sails save with a contrary wind, and with\r\nthis he returned to the island from which he had started. Also Alvaro\r\nDornellas, an esquire and servant of the Infant, and a good man and\r\nbrave, armed another caravel, in the which he laboured hard to achieve\r\nsome deed for his honour, yet was he never able to capture more than two\r\nCanarians, whom he took in one of those islands; and with them he sent\r\nback his caravel, giving the charge to an esquire to have it repaired\r\nfor him and to return there against the next year. And further on we\r\nwill relate something of the fortune of this esquire, in that he toiled\r\ngreatly for his honour.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BQ: Madeira.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI.\r\n\r\nOf how the men of Pallenço took the six Moors.\r\n\r\n\r\nDinis Diaz, as we have already said, armed a caravel of Don Alvaro de\r\nCastro and started at the beginning in company with Pallenço, who was\r\ntaking out a pinnace, not that he intended to make use of it in aught\r\nsave only in entering the river of Nile; for since it was an old one, he\r\nmeant to abandon it whenever he should perceive it to be past service.\r\nAnd so the two, pursuing their voyage, came to the Isle of Arguim, and\r\nafter they had taken in water, they agreed to continue so far on their\r\nway until they reached the land of the Negroes, according to the purpose\r\nwith which they had set out from this Kingdom. And when they had already\r\npassed a good distance beyond the point of Santa Anna[N164] and were\r\nbecalmed one day, Pallenço said that it would not be an evil thing to\r\nland some men, who might essay to make capture of the Moors. \"Wherefore\r\nis it,\" replied Dinis Diaz, \"that men should be employed in such an\r\nadventure? Let us rather go straight on our way, for if God shall bring\r\nus to that land of Guinea, we shall surely find Moors more than\r\nsufficient to load our ships.\" True it is, as Dinis Diaz said, that many\r\nMoors were to be found there, but they were not so easy to capture as he\r\nthought; for, believe me, they are very brave men and full of artifices\r\nin their defence, and this you will see clearly in the next chapters\r\nwhen we shall speak of their combats. \"Friend,\" replied Pallenço, \"even\r\nthough it happen that we take many Moors there, what shall we lose if\r\nGod give us some here first? At any rate,\" said he, \"it seemeth well to\r\nme that we should try if we can take them, and it might please God now\r\nfor us to capture so many here as to save us from voyaging further for\r\nthis time.\" \"Since it is so,\" said Dinis Diaz, \"order it as you please.\"\r\nSo Pallenço straightway made ready his pinnace to go on shore, and\r\nalthough the sea was very calm, yet there was a very great surf on the\r\ncoast which never permitted the pinnace to touch the beach; but he,\r\ndesirous of finishing what he had begun, said to his company: \"You see,\r\nmy friends, that the roughness of the sea near this coast will not allow\r\nus to touch the shore; nevertheless my will would be to land, but as I\r\nknow not how to swim, it would be folly for me to dare such a thing. But\r\nif there are any amongst you that can go on shore by swimming, I will\r\nsurely thank them much to do it, and afterwards you will not be without\r\nthat praise which good men and true deserve for their valorous deeds.\"\r\n\"It is true,\" replied some, \"that we have a good will to do your\r\npleasure, but two dangers will follow from it. The first is that we know\r\nnot how we shall get on shore, for these waves here may pitch us about\r\nin such wise that we lose the mastery over our limbs and we shall perish\r\nvery quickly, for such things have already happened on other occasions.\r\nThe second danger is that, if we go on land and meet some people with\r\nwhom perchance we ought not to fight without your aid, and if the sea is\r\nin such a state that you cannot reach the shore, what shall we do?\" And\r\nas you see that where many men are, their opinions differ, so whilst\r\nPallenço was listening to the reasons these men gave, others went apart\r\nand would not hear any part of that counsel, but suddenly appeared naked\r\nbefore Pallenço, prepared to throw themselves into the water. \"Here we\r\nare,\" said they, \"order us what to do, for death is the same in every\r\npart, and if God hath determined that we should die in His service, this\r\nis the best time in which to finish our lives.\" After this, admonished\r\nby their captain, they made ready their clothes and arms as well as they\r\ncould and fell to swimming; and so it pleased God that, rough as the sea\r\nwas there, all twelve of them gained the shore as they had left the\r\nships. Then they began to take their way along the beach, and they had\r\nnot gone far when one of them who was in front spake to the others,\r\ntelling them to be quiet, for that he saw the footprints of people, and\r\nthe best was that they appeared to him to be recent. \"Meseemeth,\" said\r\nhe, \"that we should go after them, for by the appearance of their\r\nfootmarks, they ought not to be far off.\" \"And for what,\" said the\r\nothers, \"did we adventure ourselves before our companions to leap into\r\nthe sea, if we were to do otherwise?\" Then they ordered three men to go\r\nin front and to keep their eyes on the track, and the others were to\r\nfollow after them. And when they had gone in that expectation for the\r\nspace of two leagues, they discovered a valley, and herein those men who\r\nwere in the van caught sight of the Moors whose track they were\r\nfollowing; but they seemed to them to be so few that, with the good will\r\nthat was in them, they felt grieved, even though they had a greater\r\nassurance of victory. And so they turned their faces toward the others,\r\nwho were coming behind, to advise them of the booty that was before\r\nthem; and their words were brief, for scarcely had they begun to speak\r\nof \"Moors\" when the men behind were already beginning to run, and to\r\nraise their battle-cries as they ran; and the sound of these both warned\r\nand saddened their enemies. But for the last there was no other remedy\r\nsave flight, for they had little care of their poor and scanty goods;\r\nand sure I am that those who escaped thence were slow to return with\r\nlonging regret for their baggage. Now our men had commenced their chace\r\nearly, and were already wearied by their landing from the pinnace and by\r\ntheir going along the road; therefore they were not able to follow much\r\nupon the track; and on this account their booty was much diminished, for\r\nthey captured no more than nine persons. \"It would be well,\" said some,\r\n\"were we to set aside six of our people to take these prisoners to the\r\nships, and that the other six remaining should search through that thick\r\nundergrowth, for there perchance we shall find some[BR] in hiding.\"\r\nAccordingly those who were to return with the captives straightway\r\nseparated from the others and began to bind their prisoners in the best\r\nway they could; but it seemeth that they did it not as well as the case\r\nrequired, although six were sufficient for[BS] nine, as you have already\r\nheard that others had previously convoyed many more without any contrary\r\nhap. And since women are usually stubborn, one woman of that company\r\nbegan to take it in conceipt to refuse to walk, throwing herself on the\r\nground and letting herself be dragged along by the hair and the legs,\r\nhaving no pity on herself; and her over-great stubbornness compelled our\r\nmen to leave her there bound, intending to return for her another day.\r\nAnd as they were going along in this contention, the others[BT] began to\r\ndisperse, fleeing some to one side and some to another, and two of them\r\ngot away, not counting the Mooress whom they had already left bound; and\r\nthough our men laboured hard to catch them, they were not successful,\r\nfor it appeareth that the spot was such that they were easily able to\r\nconceal themselves. And so they were forced to bring those six to the\r\nbeach with many complaints of their ill fortune; and herein the others\r\nshared who arrived later without having found anything. Some among them\r\nstill wished to return for the Mooress who had been left behind in\r\nbonds, but as it was very late and the sea was dangerous, they gave up\r\nthe attempt, and afterward they had no opportunity, for the pinnace\r\ndeparted straightway; and so remained the Mooress with her foolish\r\nstubbornness, strongly bound in that wood, wherein I believe she would\r\nmeet with a troublous death, for those who escaped thence, being\r\nfrightened by the first encounter, would not return that way very soon.\r\nAnd as these ships went on their course, the wind began to freshen and\r\nto blow very strongly, and so greatly were the said ships beaten about\r\nby the storm that the pinnace commenced to leak and to take in so much\r\nwater that Pallenço perceived that it could not well voyage any further.\r\nFor if it did, there was a doubt whether it would reach the place he\r\ndesired, and also there might chance to come such a wind that the\r\ncaravel would be separated from them, and their lives would be put in\r\nperil. So he said to Dinis Diaz that he should receive him into his\r\nship, and also the rest of the crew, together with all the fittings and\r\ntackle of the pinnace, as well as much of the wood for fuel; and when\r\nthese had been brought on board, they scuttled the pinnace and set\r\nforward on their voyage.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BR: Natives.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BS: _I.e._, to guard.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BT: Captives.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII.\r\n\r\nOf what happened to Rodrigueannes de Travaços and Dinis Diaz.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already told how Rodrigueannes and Dinis Diaz sailed in company,\r\nbut this is the fitting place where it behoveth us to declare certainly\r\nall that happened to them. And it was so, that they, sailing in company\r\nafter the manner we have already told, which we believe was after the\r\nscuttling of the pinnace, came to Cape Verde; and thence they went to\r\nthe islands,[N165] and took in water, and knew for sure by the tracks\r\nall over them that other ships had already passed by that way. From\r\nthere they began to make proof of the Guineas, in search of whom they\r\nhad come there, but they found them so well prepared, that though they\r\nessayed to get on shore many a time, they always encountered such a bold\r\ndefence that they dared not come to close quarters. \"It may be,\" said\r\nDinis Diaz, \"that these men will not be so brave in the night time as by\r\nday; therefore I wish to try what their courage is, and I can readily\r\nknow it this next night.\" And this in fact was put in practice, for as\r\nsoon as the sun had quite hidden its light, he went on shore, taking\r\nwith him two men, and came upon two inhabited places which seemed to him\r\nso large that he thought it best to leave them, for his expedition was\r\nnot in order to adventure anything, but only that he might advise his\r\nother comrades of what they should do. Then he returned to the ship and\r\nthere described to Rodrigueannes and the others all that he had found.\r\n\"We,\" said he, \"should be acting with small judgment, were we wishful to\r\nadventure a conflict like this; for I discovered a village divided into\r\ntwo large parts full of habitations, and you know that the people of\r\nthis land are not so easily captured as we desire, for they are very\r\nstrong men, very wary and very well prepared in their combats, and the\r\nworst is that they have their arrows poisoned with a very dangerous\r\nherb. Wherefore it seemeth to me that we ought to turn back, for all our\r\ntoil will be the cause of our death, if we should make an attempt upon\r\nthese people.\" To this the others replied that it was well said, for\r\nthey all knew that he spake the truth. Then they mended their sails and\r\ncommenced to leave. Now Dinis Diaz said that he had seen one thing on\r\nthat island that seemed to him a novelty, as far as his knowledge went,\r\nthat is he saw, among the cows, two strange animals, very ugly in\r\ncomparison with the other cattle; but as these two were going in company\r\nwith them, I hold that they might perchance be buffaloes,[N166] which\r\nare animals in the nature of oxen. And it was so, that as those men were\r\nreturning, Rodrigueannes, who was leaving that land ill-contented\r\nbecause he had found no opportunity of displaying the good-will he\r\nnourished to achieve some honourable action, said to Dinis Diaz that it\r\nseemed to him it would be well were they to send some of their men on\r\nshore, for it might happen that some Moors would come to seize the wood\r\nof the pinnace which they had left scuttled, and if they chanced on\r\nthem, they could not fail to capture some. And as Dinis Diaz agreed with\r\nthis, they put out their boats, in the which they dispatched twenty men\r\nto the shore. And clear it is that Rodrigueannes was not mistaken in his\r\nthought, for the Moors were already engaged in collecting that wood on\r\nthe shore; and when they saw that the boats were coming to the land,\r\nthey drew away a space from the beach, as men who said: \"these are\r\narrived in search of us, therefore let us seek out a way by which we may\r\nnot only secure ourselves, but even do them hurt as well.\" So they threw\r\nthemselves into two ambushes with the object of enticing our men away\r\nfrom the shore and employing their strength safely and without danger to\r\nthemselves. Meanwhile the Christians landed, and halted for a space to\r\norder their movements, and this because they discovered such traces of\r\nthe Moors that they thought they could not be removed far from there;\r\nyet they perceived by the number of the footmarks that the enemy was\r\nmany more in number than their forces could cope with, and this made\r\nsome ask that they should return, saying that it was not a thing to be\r\nattempted. But others said, \"There is no help for it; we are already on\r\nshore, and it would be a disgrace were we to turn back; let the boats\r\nreturn, and let us go forward in search of our enemies, and let all our\r\nfortune rest in God's hand.\" And of the first twenty that were there six\r\nturned back to the boats to take them to the ships, and the fourteen[BU]\r\nwent forward as they found that the tracks led in the direction of the\r\nUpland. But their toil in marching was not long, for lo, the first\r\nambuscade began to disclose itself, and in it there would be about forty\r\nMoors, who issued forth against them[BV] very eagerly, like men who felt\r\nthey had victory in their grasp, as well by reason of their numbers,\r\nwhich were greater, as on account of the others who were lying in the\r\nother ambuscade, on whom they relied to come and aid them. But although\r\nthe Moors came on thus boldly, the Christians did not turn their backs\r\nto them, but on the contrary made ready their weapons, and after the\r\nmanner of fearless men awaited the coming of their foes. And after this\r\nthere began a very fierce combat between them, in the which lances and\r\narrows were not without employment, and they found neither harness nor\r\ncoat of mail to stay their course. Now there were no stones on the field\r\nof which the Moors could much avail themselves; and as they were without\r\narmour and the Christians employed all their efforts in wounding and\r\nslaying them, the Moors began to feel themselves overmatched, and they\r\nwithdrew from our men as far as they could. And in this fight a page of\r\nthe Infant's Household, called Martin Pereira, toiled hard, and his\r\nshield was as full of the enemy's weapons as though it were the back of\r\na porcupine when he lifteth his quills.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BU: In text, Eighteen.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BV: The Portuguese.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIII.\r\n\r\nOf how those in the second ambuscade disclosed themselves, and how the\r\nMoors were vanquished.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Moors did not draw off so far that the combat between the two sides\r\ncontinued any the less fierce, and the chief reason of this was that\r\nthey expected succour from the second ambuscade, although it already\r\nseemed to them that it tarried more than was reasonable. However, there\r\nsallied forth at last twenty-five Moors, who lay in the said ambuscade,\r\nand their loud cries did much to revive the courage of their companions,\r\nand now you can understand how great would be the toil of our\r\nChristians, with their scanty numbers placed amid so many foes. Of a\r\nsurety their fortitude showed itself very great on that occasion, for\r\nthough they were already wearied, and so many fresh fighters came upon\r\nthem, yet did they in no wise change their aspect which they had worn\r\nbefore, and so like good men and brave they began to fight, calling out\r\none to the other that \"damned was the man who turned back in such an\r\naffair as the present.\" And those Moors of the first combat, though they\r\nhad previously shown signs of being vanquished, turned again very boldly\r\nto renew the struggle, the which was very fierce between them; but the\r\nChristians punished them so sorely that the enemy were already becoming\r\nfearful, and did not readily approach where our men had the greatest\r\nforce. But this did not protect them, for the one or the other failed\r\nnot to receive mortal wounds, with the which they very soon finished the\r\nterm of their existence. And so it went on for a short while, until the\r\nMoors saw some of their comrades fall and almost the greater part\r\nwounded, and then they perceived that the longer they stayed there, the\r\nworse would be the hurt inflicted on them. Wherefore they began although\r\nquite at the first encounter they saw their companions engaged in that\r\nfight, were encouraged to think that they would need no other\r\nassistance, save that which none of us can dispense with, to wit, that\r\nof our Lord God, and they were very joyous at the marvellous courage\r\nthey perceived in those men. But after they saw how the other ambush\r\ncame up, they feared much that they would not be able to stand against\r\nthem, wherefore they endeavoured as speedily as they could to give them\r\naid; but since the distance was great, they were not able to reach the\r\nscene of the combat very quickly. And in a short time the Moors were all\r\nfled, but our men did not follow up their track on account of the great\r\ntoil they had gone through, for thereby they were greatly fatigued. And\r\nso they returned, with the others who were coming in their support, to\r\ntake shelter in their ships and attend to their wounds, for few were\r\nwithout these, either great or small, according to the share of luck\r\nthat befell each man. And the Moors, when they saw how the Christians\r\nwere already returning, retraced their steps to the scene of the fight,\r\nintending to carry off one of those dead men who it seemeth was\r\nconsidered a noble amongst them; and our men perceiving their mind,\r\nturned back against them to renew the fight. But the enemy, warned by\r\nthe hurt they had received before, left the dead man they were even then\r\nbearing off, and took to flight as fast as they could, so that it seemed\r\nto our men to be needful that they should return to their ships to give\r\nrest and cure to their weary and wounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIV.\r\n\r\nOf how Rodrigueannes and Dinis Diaz returned to the kingdom,[BW] and of\r\nwhat befell them on their voyage.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd though it be that I have already told of noble and great deeds in\r\nthis Chronicle, of a surety it is not without a cause that I add the\r\ntoil of those fourteen men to the praise of all the good, for their\r\nmerits are worthy of great honour among the living, and much more I\r\nbelieve before the face of that Eternal Lord (whose centre, as\r\nHermes[N167] saith, is in every part in an infinite manner and whose\r\ncircumference is nowhere), for from Him shall their souls receive\r\nglorious bliss. And to make an end of the actions of these two caravels,\r\nI will say briefly that as soon as this fight was over, the captains\r\nagreed to return straight to the Kingdom. But when they reached the Cape\r\nof Tira, they both came to an accord to put on shore certain men, to see\r\nwhether they could still make any booty, though they knew for certain\r\nthat the land had been searched many times before. And so when these\r\nwere landed, to the number of fifty, they began to make their way along\r\nthe beach until they met with the footprints of men that led towards the\r\ninterior, and as the tracks appeared recent, they informed their\r\ncaptains of it. And from them they received commandment to set aside\r\nsome of their number who should go forward and follow up the track until\r\nthey came upon the Moors who had made it. And as the land was very\r\nlevel, the Moors caught sight of our men from a distance and began to\r\nflee, and though the Christians ran hard after them they were never able\r\nto follow them; but it happened that two youths of the company met with\r\na Moor whom they brought back with them as an evidence of their great\r\ntoil. And thence they forthwith made sail to Lisbon, where having paid\r\nto the Infant his due, they had of him honour and reward.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BW: Of Portugal.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXV.\r\n\r\nOf how the caravel of John Gonçalvez Zarco arrived at the land of the\r\nNegroes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt still remaineth for me to relate the hap of the caravel of John\r\nGonçalvez Zarco, who, to my thinking, bore himself in this affair more\r\nwithout hope of gain than any of the others sent there; for all those\r\nothers, as you have already heard, had a mind to profit themselves, as\r\nwell as to do service to the Infant. But this John Gonçalvez was noble\r\nin all his actions, and so he wished the world to know that for his\r\nLord's service alone he disposed himself to have that voyage made. And\r\ntherefore he armed a very fine caravel, and the captaincy of this he\r\nbestowed on his nephew, named Alvaro Fernandez, whom the Infant had\r\nbrought up in his household, and he ordered him to have regard to no\r\nother profit, save only to see and know any new thing he could. And he\r\nwas not to hinder himself by making raids in the land of the Moors, but\r\nto take his way straight to the land of the Negroes and thenceforward to\r\nlengthen his voyage as much as he could,[N168] and endeavour to bring\r\nsome new thing to the Infant his lord, such as he thought would give him\r\npleasure. The caravel was well victualled and it was manned by men ready\r\nfor toils, and Alvaro Fernandez was young in years and audacious. So\r\nthey directed their voyage, determined to second the purpose of him who\r\nhad dispatched them, and they went sailing over that great ocean sea\r\nuntil they reached the River of Nile,[N169] and they knew it by the\r\nsigns I have before mentioned, and took on board two pipes of water, one\r\nof which they brought to the city of Lisbon. And I know not if\r\nAlexander, who was one of the monarchs of the world, drank in his days\r\nof water that had been brought him from so far. From hence they went\r\nforward until they passed Cape Verde, beyond which they descried an\r\nisland[N170] on the which they landed to see if they could meet with any\r\nnatives, but they observed that caution in their own regard which they\r\nfelt to be proper in such a place. And as they were going through the\r\nisland, they found tame goats without any persons guarding them, or\r\nindeed dwelling in any part of that island, and then they took their\r\nrefreshment of them; and we have already told how the others found their\r\ntracks when they came to those islands, for this Alvaro Fernandez was\r\nthere first, and because the story could not be told in any other manner\r\nwe have related it first of all in the way you have heard. Thence they\r\nwent forward to the spot where the palm tree is, and that huge tree of\r\nwhich we have left an account in the other chapters, and here they found\r\nthe arms of the Infant, with his device and motto. There they came to an\r\nagreement to go and lie near unto the Cape, for it might be that some\r\ncanoes would come to them with which they could hold converse, at least\r\nby signs, for they had no other interpreter. And when they were as near\r\nto the Cape as it might be a third of a league, they cast anchor and\r\nrested as they had arranged; but they had not been there long when from\r\nthe land there set out two boats, manned by ten Guineas, who straightway\r\nbegan to make their way direct to the ship, like men who came in peace.\r\nAnd when they were near, they made a signal asking security, which was\r\ngranted them, and immediately without any other precaution, five of them\r\nwent on board the caravel, where Alvaro Fernandez had them entertained\r\nas hospitably as he was able, giving orders to provide them with food\r\nand drink and all other good company that could be made them. And after\r\nthis they departed, giving signs of great contentment, but it seemeth\r\nthat they had come with something different conceived in their minds.\r\nAnd as soon as they reached the land they told the rest of their fellows\r\nall they had found, and from this it seemed to them that they could\r\neasily capture them.[BX] And with this design there put off six boats\r\nwith thirty-five or forty of their company prepared like men who meant\r\nto fight; but when they were near, they felt a fear of coming up to the\r\ncaravel, and so they stayed a little distance off without daring to make\r\nan attack. And when Alvaro Fernandez perceived that they dared not come\r\nto him, he commanded his boat to be lowered and in it he ordered eight\r\nmen to place themselves, from among the readiest that he found for the\r\nduty; and he arranged that the boat should be on the further side of the\r\ncaravel so that it might not be seen by the enemy, in the hope that they\r\nwould approach nearer to the ship. And the Guineas lay some way off\r\nuntil one of their boats took courage to move more forward and issued\r\nforth from the others towards the caravel, and in it were five brave and\r\nstout Guineas, distinguished in this respect among the others of the\r\ncompany. And as soon as Alvaro Fernandez perceived that this boat was\r\nalready in a position for him to be able to reach it before it could\r\nreceive help from the others, he ordered his own to issue forth quickly\r\nand go against it. And by the great advantage of our men in their manner\r\nof rowing they were soon upon the enemy, who seeing themselves thus\r\novertaken, and having no hope of defence, leapt into the water, while\r\nthe other boats fled towards the land. But our men had very great toil\r\nin the capture of those who were swimming, for they dived like\r\ncormorants, so that they could not get a hold of them; yet they soon\r\ncaptured one, though not without some difficulty; but the capture of the\r\nsecond caused them to lose all the others. For he was so valiant that\r\ntwo men, very mighty as they were, could not drag him into the boat\r\nuntil they took a boathook and caught him above one eye, and the pain of\r\nthis made him abate his courage and allow himself to be put inside the\r\nboat. And with these two captives they returned to the ship. And since\r\nAlvaro Fernandez saw that it was of no profit for him to remain in that\r\nspot, and that it might rather injure him, because they already had\r\nknowledge of him, he said that he wished to go on further to see if he\r\ncould find some new thing to bring to the Infant his lord. And departing\r\nhence, they arrived at a Cape where there were many bare palm trees\r\nwithout palms, and they named this Cape of the Masts.[BY][N171] And\r\ngoing forward on their course, Alvaro Fernandez made seven men embark in\r\nthe boat and ordered them to row along the coast, and as they went, they\r\ncaught sight of four Guineas seated by the water's edge; and as the men\r\nin the boat saw that they were not perceived by them, six of them leapt\r\nout and pursued their way, concealing themselves as much as they could\r\nuntil they were near to the Guineas, when they began to run to capture\r\nthem. And it seemeth to me that these Guineas were archers who were\r\ngoing to kill their wild game in the hills with poison, even as the\r\nbowmen do in this our Spain.[BZ] And as soon as they caught sight of our\r\nmen, they got up very hastily and began to flee, without having time to\r\nput arrows in their bows; but though our men ran a long way they could\r\nnever take them, although at times they came close to them, and the\r\nreason was that these men go naked and have only very short hair, so\r\nthat it is not possible to capture them by it. And so they got clear of\r\nour men, who yet seized their bows and quivers and arrows, together with\r\na quantity of wild boar's flesh that they had roasted. And among these\r\nanimals that they found was one that looked like a hind,[N172] which\r\nthese Guineas were taking with a basket as a muzzle over its mouth to\r\nkeep it from eating; and, so far as our men could see, they were using\r\nthat animal as a decoy, that it might draw the other deer to them by its\r\ngentleness. And since they saw it so tame they would not kill it; and\r\nthen they returned to their ships, where they took their resolve to come\r\nto the Kingdom, making their way straight to the Island of Madeira, and\r\nthence to the City of Lisbon. And there they found the Infant and\r\nreceived many bounties at his hands, in the which John Gonçalvez had no\r\nsmall share on account of the good will that had moved him to serve the\r\nInfant in that enterprise. And this was the caravel which in this year\r\nwent further than all the others that voyaged to that land.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BX: The Portuguese.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BY: Cabo dos Matos.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote BZ: The word Spain is here used to designate the\r\n    whole Peninsula, as was usual at that time.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVI.\r\n\r\nHow the Author beginneth to speak of the manner of that land.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well that we should here leave these matters at rest for a space\r\nand treat of the limits of those lands through the which our people\r\njourneyed in the labours of which we have spoken, in order that you may\r\nhave an understanding of the delusion in which our forefathers ever\r\nlived who were affrighted to pass that Cape for fear of those things of\r\nwhich we have told in the beginning of this book; and also that you may\r\nsee how great praise our Prince deserveth, by bringing their doubts\r\nbefore the presence not only of us who are now living, but also of all\r\nothers who will be born in the time to come. And because one of the\r\nthings which they alleged to be a hindrance to the passage into these\r\nlands consisted of the very strong currents that were there, on account\r\nof which it was impossible for any ship to navigate those seas, you now\r\nhave a clear knowledge of their former error in that you have seen\r\nvessels come and go as free from danger as in any part of the other\r\nseas. They further alleged that the lands were all sandy and without any\r\ninhabitants, and true it is that in the matter of the sands they were\r\nnot altogether deceived, but these were not so great as they thought;\r\nwhile as to the inhabitants, you have clearly seen the contrary to be\r\nthe fact, since you witness the dwellers in those parts each day before\r\nyour eyes, although their inhabited places are chiefly villages and very\r\nfew towns. For from the Cape of Bojador to the kingdom of Tunis there\r\nwill not be in the whole, what with towns and places fortified for\r\ndefence, as many as fifty. They were no less at fault as regards the\r\ndepth of the sea, for they had it marked on their charts that the shores\r\nwere so shallow that at the distance of a league from the land there was\r\nonly a fathom of water; but this was found not to be so, for the ships\r\nhave had and have sufficient depth for their management, except for\r\ncertain shoals; and thus dwellings[N173] were made that exist on certain\r\nsandbanks, as you will find now in the navigating charts[N174] which the\r\nInfant caused to be prepared.\r\n\r\nIn the land of the Negroes there is no walled place save that which they\r\ncall Oadem,[N175] nor are there any settlements except some by the\r\nwater's edge, of straw houses, the which were emptied of their dwellers\r\nby those that went there in the ships of this land. True it is that the\r\nwhole land is generally peopled, but their mode of living is only in\r\ntents and carts,[N176] such as we use here when our princes do happen to\r\ngo upon a warlike march; and those who were captured there gave\r\ntestimony of this, and also John Fernandez, of whom we have already\r\nspoken, related much concerning the same. All their principal study and\r\ntoil is in guarding their flocks, to wit, cows and sheep and goats and\r\ncamels, and they change their camp almost every day, for the longest\r\nthey can rest in one spot will be eight days. And some of their chief\r\nmen possess tame mares, of which they breed horses, though very few.\r\n\r\nTheir food consisteth for the great part of milk, and sometimes a little\r\nmeat and the seeds of wild herbs that they gather in those mountains,\r\nand some who have been there have said that these herbs (but of them\r\nthere are few)[N177] seem to be the millet of that land. Also they eat\r\nwheat when they can obtain it, in the same way that we in this land eat\r\nconfetti.[N178] And for many months of the year they and their horses\r\nand dogs maintain themselves by no other thing except the drinking of\r\nmilk. And those that live by the sea shore eat nothing save fish, and\r\nall for the most part without either bread or anything else, except the\r\nwater that they drink, and they generally eat their fish raw and dried.\r\nTheir clothing consisteth of a skin vest and breeches of the same, but\r\nsome of the more honourable wear bournouses; and some pre-eminent men,\r\nwho are almost above all the others, have good garments, like the other\r\nMoors, and good horses and good saddles, and good stirrups, but these\r\nare very few.\r\n\r\nThe women wear bournouses which are like mantles, with the which they\r\nonly cover their faces, and by that they think they have covered all\r\ntheir shame, for they leave their bodies quite naked. \"For sure,\" saith\r\nhe who compiled this history, \"this is one of the things by the which\r\none may discern their great bestiality,[N179] for if they had some\r\nparticle of reason they would follow nature, and cover those parts only\r\nwhich by its shewing ought to be covered, for we see how naturally in\r\neach one of these shameful parts it placeth a circle of hair in proof\r\nthat it wished to hide them; and also some naturalists hold that if\r\nthose hairs be let alone, they will grow so much as to hide all the\r\nparts of your shame.\" And the wives of the most honourable men wear\r\nrings of gold in their nostrils and ears, as well as other jewels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVII.\r\n\r\nOf the things that happened to John Fernandez.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat we may assist in the knowledge of these matters, let us relate in\r\nthis place the hap of John Fernandez[N180] in this land during those\r\nseven months in which he stayed there in the service of the Lord Infant,\r\nas you have already heard. Now he, remaining there in the power of the\r\nrelations of that Moor whom Antam Gonçalvez brought to this land, was\r\nconducted by them with his garments and biscuit and some corn that was\r\nleft to him, and also his wearing apparel; and these things were all\r\ntaken from him against his will, and he was only given a bournous like\r\neach of the other Moors wore. And the men with whom he thus remained\r\nwere shepherds, and they departed to their country with their sheep, and\r\nhe went with them.[N181] And he reported that this country is all sandy,\r\nwithout any grass, except in the riverine lands or low-lying parts,\r\nwhere there is some grass from which the herds obtain their poor\r\nnutriment; but there are hills and mountains all of sand.[N182] And this\r\nland runneth from Tagazza[CA][N183] as far as the land of the Negroes,\r\nand it joineth with the Mediterranean Sea at the extremity of the\r\nkingdom of Tunis and Momdebarque. And from there all the land is like\r\nthis I have described, even from the Mediterranean Sea as far as the\r\nNegroes and Alexandria, all peopled by shepherd folk in greater or\r\nsmaller numbers, according as they find pasturage for their flocks; and\r\nthere are no trees in it save small ones, such as the fig-tree of\r\nHell[CB] or the thorn, and in some places there are palms.[N184] And all\r\nthe water[N185] is from wells, for there are no running streams, save in\r\na very few spots, and the breadth of this land will be three thousand\r\nleagues and its length a thousand, and there is no noble place in it\r\nsave Alexandria and Cairo.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote CA: In text \"Tagaoz.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote CB: The _Palma Christi_.]\r\n\r\nNow the characters in which they write[N186] and the language which they\r\nspeak are not like those of the other Moors, but are clean different;\r\nyet they are all of the sect of Mohammed, and are called Arabs[CC] and\r\nAzanegues and Berbers.[N187] And they all go in the manner I have\r\nalready said, to wit, in tents with their herds, wherever it pleaseth\r\nthem, without any rule or governance or law, for each goeth as he\r\nwilleth and doeth what pleaseth him in so far as he hath power. They\r\nmake war with the Negroes more by thieving than by force, for they have\r\nnot so great strength as these last.[N188] And to their land come some\r\nMoors and they sell them of those Negroes whom they have kidnapped, or\r\nelse they take them to Momdebarque, which is beyond the kingdom of\r\nTunis, to sell[N189] to the Christian merchants who go there, and they\r\ngive them these slaves in exchange for bread and some other things, just\r\nas they do now at the Rio do Ouro, as will be related further on. And\r\n'tis well for you to know that in all the land of Africa which\r\nstretcheth from Egypt to the West, the Moors have no other kingdom than\r\nthe kingdom of Fez, in the which lieth that of Marocco and of Tafilet;\r\nand the kingdom of Tunis, in which is that of Tlemcen[CD] and of Bugia;\r\nand all the rest of the country is possessed by these Arabs and\r\nAzanegues, who are shepherds on horseback and foot, and who travel over\r\nthe plains as I have already related. And it is said that in the land of\r\nthe Negroes there is another kingdom called Melli, but this is not\r\ncertain;[N190] for they bring the Negroes from that kingdom, and sell\r\nthem like the others, whereas 'tis manifest that if they were Moors they\r\nwould not sell them so.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote CC: In text \"Alarves.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote CD: In text \"Tremecam.\"]\r\n\r\nAnd returning to the hap of John Fernandez, who went off thus with those\r\nshepherds; He reported that, as he journeyed with them over those sands\r\nhe oftentimes had not sufficient milk. And it fell out one day that two\r\nhorsemen passed by there who were journeying in the direction of that\r\nAhude Meymam, of whom we have already spoken before, and they asked this\r\nJohn Fernandez if he wished to go to the place where that Moor lived?\r\n\"Well it pleaseth me,\" answered John Fernandez, \"for I have heard that\r\nhe is a noble man, and I would fain go to see and know him.\" So then the\r\nothers placed him on a camel and they began to journey in the direction\r\nwhere they thought the Moor was, and they travelled so far that the\r\nwater they were carrying fell very low, on which account they went three\r\ndays without drinking. And he saith that they know not the place where\r\nany people dwell save by keeping their eyes on the heavens,[N191] and\r\nwhere they see crows and _hussos francos_,[N192] they judge there are\r\npeople, for in all that country there is no fixed road save those that\r\ngo by the sea coast. And that John Fernandez said that those Moors with\r\nwhom he travelled guided themselves by the winds alone, as is done on\r\nthe sea, and by those birds which we have already mentioned. And they\r\njourneyed so far through that land, enduring their thirst, until they\r\nreached the place where was that Ahude Meymam with his sons and with\r\nothers who accompanied him, in number as many as one hundred and fifty\r\nmen. And to him John Fernandez made his reverence, and the Moor received\r\nhim right well, and ordered him to be supplied with the food on which he\r\nsupported himself, to wit, milk, so that at the time he was picked up by\r\nthe caravels he was well nourished and of a good colour. He reported\r\nthat the heats of that land are very great, and so is the dust of those\r\nsands, and the men on foot many, and therefore few on horseback, for the\r\nremainder who are not such as to travel on foot go on camels, of which\r\nlatter some are white and make fifty leagues[N193] in the day. And there\r\nis a great sufficiency of these camels, not of the white in particular,\r\nbut of all colours, and there are also many flocks and herds, though the\r\npastures be so few, as we have already noted. And he further saith that\r\nthey have captive Negroes, and that the men of rank possess abundant\r\ngold, which they bring from that land where the Negroes live; and that\r\nthere are in that land many ostriches[CE] and deer, and gazelles and\r\npartridges and hares, and that the swallows which depart hence[CF] in\r\nthe summer go and winter there on those sands, and I believe this is on\r\naccount of the heat; and other small birds go there as well, but he\r\nsaith that the storks pass over to the land of the Negroes, where they\r\nabide through the winter.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote CE: In text \"Emas.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote CF: Portugal.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVIII.\r\n\r\nOf the leagues that the caravels of the Infant went beyond the Cape, and\r\nof other things of all kinds.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the opinion among many people in Spain, and of other parts as\r\nwell, that those great birds called ostriches did not hatch their eggs,\r\nbut that as soon as they laid them on the sand they left them there; but\r\nit was found to be quite the contrary, for they lay twenty and thirty\r\neggs and hatch them like other birds. And he[CG] reporteth that the\r\nthings in that land, by which those who live by merchandise may gain\r\nprofit, are those Negroes, whereof they have many whom they kidnap; and\r\ngold, which they get from the land of the latter; and hides, and wool,\r\nand butter, together with cheeses, of which there are many there; and\r\nalso dates in great abundance, which are brought from another part, and\r\namber, and the perfume of the civet, and resin,[N194] and oil, and skins\r\nof sea-wolves, which are in great numbers in the Rio do Ouro as you have\r\nheard. And they could also obtain somewhat of the merchandise of Guinea,\r\nof which there are many kinds and very good, as will be recounted\r\nfurther on. And it was found that up to this era of 1446 years from the\r\nbirth of Jesus Christ, fifty and one caravels had voyaged to those\r\nparts; but of the sum of the Moors that they captured we will speak at\r\nthe end of this first book. And these caravels passed beyond the\r\nCape[CH] four hundred and fifty leagues. And it is found that all that\r\ncoast goeth to the south, with many promontories, according to what this\r\nour Prince had added to the navigating chart. And it should be\r\nunderstood that what had been known for certain of the coast of the\r\ngreat sea was six hundred[N195] leagues, and to them are now added these\r\nfour hundred and fifty. And what was shown on the _mappemonde_ with\r\nrespect to this coast was not true, for they only depicted it at hazard;\r\nbut this which is now placed on the charts was a matter witnessed by the\r\neye, as you have already heard.[N196]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote CG: Fernandez.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote CH: Bojador.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIX.\r\n\r\nWhich speaketh of the Island of Canary and of the manner of living\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeseemeth I ought to give an account of many things in this book, for if\r\nI speak of them so briefly, those that read the history will remain\r\nstill in desire and wishful to learn the details by which to perfect\r\ntheir knowledge. And since I told in the beginning of this book how the\r\nInfant Don Henry despatched an expedition to the Canary Islands, and\r\nafterwards how the ships sailed there to make some captures, I would now\r\nset forth the number of these islands and the manner of their\r\ninhabitants, and of their beliefs, and after that, everything that\r\npertaineth to them. And, as I have found in ancient writings, in the\r\ntime that the King Don Henry reigned in Castile, who was son of Don John\r\nthe first, who was vanquished at the battle of Aljubarrota, a certain\r\nnobleman of France called Monsieur Jean de Béthencourt, who was a noble\r\nand Catholic man, and desired to render service to God, having learnt\r\nthat these islands belonged to infidels, set out from his country with\r\nthe purpose of subduing them. And coming into Castile he obtained ships\r\nand men, more than he brought, and he went against them and had great\r\ntoil in their conquest; but at last he made subject three, and four\r\nremained to be subdued. And for that Monsieur Jean had now used all the\r\nprovisions and money which he brought with him, he was obliged to go\r\nback to his country with the intention of returning again to finish the\r\nconquest of the whole number; and in those three which he had already\r\nconquered he left as captain a nephew of his, called Monsieur\r\nMaciot.[N197] But Monsieur Jean, when he arrived in France, returned no\r\nmore to this land; some said because he fell ill of grave disorders\r\nwhich prevented him from returning to accomplish his good purpose;\r\nothers again declared that he was kept back by the King of France on\r\naccount of the wars in which he was engaged, in the which he needed his\r\nservices; so the said Monsieur Maciot remained there for a time until he\r\npassed over to the Island of Madeira, as will be related further on. And\r\nthe peopling of these three islands, at the time of the putting together\r\nof this book, was as follows: in the island called Lançarote there dwelt\r\nsixty men, and in that of Fuerteventura eighty, and in the other, called\r\nFerro, there would be twelve men. And these are the three which were\r\nsubdued by that great lord of France. And all their inhabitants are\r\nChristians, and carry out among them the divine offices, having churches\r\nand priests. But there is another island called Gomera, which Monsieur\r\nMaciot laboured to conquer with the aid of some Castilians whom he took\r\nin his company, and they were unable to perfect their conquest, although\r\namong those Canarians there are some Christians. And the number of its\r\ninhabitants will be seven hundred men, and in the other island of Palma\r\nthere dwell five. And in the sixth island, which is that of Teneriffe or\r\nInferno, because it hath on the top a chasm through which fire\r\ncontinually issueth forth, there dwell six thousand fighting men. The\r\nseventh island they call Grand Canary, in which there will be five\r\nthousand fighting men. These three islands, from the commencement of the\r\nworld, have never been subdued, but many men have already been carried\r\noff from them, and by means of these nearly all their manner of life\r\nhath been learnt. And because they seemed to me very different from the\r\nusage of other races, I would here discourse a little about it, so that\r\nthose who have received such grace from the Lord that they are outside\r\nthe tale of such bestiality, may praise the Lord for it, because it\r\npleased Him that all things should be made in such different manners,\r\nand that those who are placed in the holy law of Christ, and for His\r\nlove would suffer some hardness of life, may get them great courage to\r\nenable them to support it well, when they recollect that these others\r\nare men likewise and that they spend such a hard and rough life with\r\npleasure and delight to themselves. Now of all these islands which I\r\nhave already named Grand Canary is the largest, and it will be in\r\ncircumference six-and-thirty leagues. Its people are not without\r\ncunning, but of little good faith; and they know that there is a God\r\nfrom whom those who work good will receive good, and those who work evil\r\nwill receive evil. And they have two men amongst them whom they call\r\nkings, and one duke, but all the rule of the island is in the hands of\r\ncertain knights, who cannot be less than one hundred and ninety in\r\nnumber, nor as many as two hundred. And when five or six of these are\r\ndead, the other knights meet together and select as many more of them\r\nwho are also the sons of knights, for they must not choose others, and\r\nthese they put in the place of those who are dead, so that the number\r\nmay always be full. And some declare that these men are of the noblest\r\nbirth recorded, for they have ever been of the lineage of knights\r\nwithout admixture of villein blood. And these knights know their creed,\r\nbut the others know nothing of it, but say only that they believe what\r\ntheir knights believe. And they must violate all the virgin girls, and\r\nafter one of the knights hath slept with the girl, then her father or he\r\nmay marry her to whomsoever he pleaseth. But before they sleep with them\r\nthey fatten them with milk until their skin is wrinkled like that of a\r\nfig, for they hold that the thin girl is not as good as the fat one; and\r\nthey say that so the womb is enlarged, enabling them to bear big\r\nchildren. And so, when she is stout, they exhibit her naked to those\r\nknights, and he who hath a mind to violate her, telleth her father that\r\nshe is now fat enough. And her father or mother maketh her enter into\r\nthe sea during some days for a certain time in each day, and she is then\r\nrelieved of some of her excessive fatness, and then they take her to the\r\nknight, and when she hath been violated her father taketh her home.\r\n\r\nThese people fight with stones, and have no other arms save a short\r\nstick to hit with. They are very daring and strong fighters on the land,\r\nwhich is very stony, and they defend it well. All of them go naked and\r\nonly wear a fork of coloured palm-leaves round about them by way of\r\nbreeches, which hideth their shame, but many of them lack even this.\r\nThey possess neither gold, nor silver, or money, nor jewels, nor any\r\nengines of warfare, save some things they make with stones, which they\r\nuse in the place of hangers, and with which they also construct the\r\nhouses wherein they dwell. They hold all gold and silver and every other\r\nmetal in disdain, counting it folly in him who desireth them, and\r\ncommonly there is none among them that hath a different opinion from the\r\nothers. Neither care they for clothes of any kind, much or little; but\r\nrather they mock at the man who prizeth them, as they do with one who\r\nprizeth gold and silver, and all the other things I have mentioned; only\r\nthey set great store on iron, which they fashion by the aid of these\r\nstones and make hooks of it to fish with. They have wheat and barley,\r\nbut they are without the wit to make bread, and only make meal which\r\nthey devour with flesh and butter. And they have many figs and dragon's\r\nblood trees, and dates, though poor ones, and they have also herbs which\r\nthey eat. And they possess moreover sheep and goats and a sufficiency of\r\npigs. And they number five thousand fighting men, as I have said above.\r\nThey only shave with stones. Some of them call themselves Christians;\r\nand after the Infant sent Don Fernando de Castro there with his fleet,\r\nin the which he carried two thousand and five hundred men and one\r\nhundred and twenty horses, many of them became Christians; and because\r\nDon Fernando was fearful that the victuals he carried would not last, he\r\nleft without conquering them altogether. And afterwards the Infant\r\nwished to send another expedition there, but the King of Castile\r\ninterfered in the matter, saying that the Islands belonged to his\r\nconquest, which of a surety is not so. And hereby this very pious\r\nundertaking, to wit, that this people might live under the law of\r\nChrist, still remained to be accomplished. But this fleet was dispatched\r\nthere in the year of Christ one thousand four hundred twenty and four.\r\nThe inhabitants of the island think it a great evil to kill flesh or\r\nskin it, and so if they get a Christian from abroad, they are rejoiced\r\nfor him to be their butcher. And when they cannot obtain as many as they\r\nneed for that trade, they seek out the worst men in the island for this\r\ncharge, and the women will have nothing to do with these persons, and\r\nthe men will not eat with them, for they hold them to be worse than\r\nlepers among us. They light fires by sticks, rubbing one against the\r\nother. The mothers suckle their children with disgust, so that the\r\ngreater part of the rearing of their babies is done by the teats of\r\nshe-goats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXX.\r\n\r\nWhich speaketh of the Island of Gomera.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fighting of the men of the island of Gomera is done with small rods\r\nlike arrows, sharp and burnt in the fire. They go about naked without\r\nany clothes, and have little shame at it; for they make a mockery of\r\nclothes, saying that they are but sacks in which men put themselves.\r\nThey have only a small amount of barley and the flesh of pigs and goats,\r\nbut little of all this. Their food is chiefly milk and herbs, like the\r\nbeasts, and the roots of rushes, and rarely meat; they eat dirty and\r\nfoul things such as rats, fleas, lice, and ticks, and consider them all\r\nas good viands. They possess no houses, but live in holes and huts.\r\nTheir women are almost common, and when anyone cometh where another is,\r\nat once the latter giveth him his woman by way of hospitality, and him\r\nthat doeth otherwise, they hold as a bad man.[N198] Wherefore the sons\r\ndo not inherit among them, but only their nephews, sons of their\r\nsisters. The greater part of their time they spend in dancing and\r\nsinging, for their whole luxury consisteth in sport without work. They\r\nplace all their happiness in the commerce of the sexes, for they have no\r\nteaching of a law, but only believe that there is a God. They will be\r\nseven hundred fighting men, who have a duke and certain headmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXI.\r\n\r\nOf the Island of Inferno or Teneriffe.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeseemeth I find a betterment of life among those inhabitants of the\r\nisland of Inferno, for they are well supplied with wheat and barley and\r\nvegetables, with many pigs and sheep and goats, and they go clothed in\r\nskins; but they possess not houses, but only huts and dens, in the which\r\nthey spend their lives. Also they draw in their privy parts, as horses\r\ndo, who only extend them when they have to generate issue, or to make\r\nwater. And they hold it to be as evil to act otherwise as we do in the\r\ncase of those who go about without small clothes. Their fighting is done\r\nwith staves made of the inner wood of the pine, fashioned like great\r\njavelins, very sharp, burnt in the fire, and dry. And they number from\r\neight to nine bands, each with a king, whom they must always take with\r\nthem, although death come to him, until the other who succeedeth to the\r\nlordship after him happeneth to die, so that they always have with them\r\none dead and the other alive. And so, when the other dieth and there are\r\ntwo dead, and they have to abandon one according to their bestial\r\nordinance, or more rightly I will say, custom, they bear him to a pit in\r\nwhich they throw him, and he who carrieth him on his neck exclaimeth as\r\nhe throws him--\"May he go to salvation.\" And these men are strong and\r\ndaring, and have wives of their own, and they live more like men than\r\nsome of these others; they fight one with the other, and in this all\r\ntheir principal care consisteth, and they believe that there is a God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXII.\r\n\r\nOf the Island of Palma.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this island of Palma have neither bread nor\r\nvegetables, but only sheep and milk and herbs, and maintain themselves\r\non these; they know not to recognise God nor any faith, but only think\r\nthey believe; like the other cattle they are very bestial; and they say\r\nthey have certain among them who are called kings; and their fighting is\r\ndone with staves like the men of Teneriffe, except that where an iron\r\nhead should be, they put a sharp horn, and another at the lower end,\r\nthough not so sharp an one as that at the top. They have no fish, nor do\r\nthe men of this island eat them; and, while those of all the other\r\nislands do just the contrary, seeking means to capture them and making\r\nuse of them in their housekeeping, these men only do not eat fish nor\r\nare they at the pains to capture them. And the number of inhabitants\r\nwill be five hundred men, which is a great marvel, that being so few\r\nthey have never been conquered from the beginning of the world; and from\r\nthis it is evident how all things are only as God willeth them to be,\r\nand at the times and within the bounds that please Him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIII.\r\n\r\nOf how the Island of Madeira was peopled, and also the other Islands\r\nthat are in that part.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince I have related, in the fifth Chapter of this work, where I spoke\r\nof the especial things which the Infant performed for the service of God\r\nand the honour of the realm, how that among the other matters\r\naccomplished by him was the peopling of these islands, I would here tell\r\nbriefly of the said peopling, and the more particularly as in the past\r\nfew chapters I have spoken of the Canary Islands. Now it was so, that in\r\nthe household of the Infant there were two noble esquires, brought up by\r\nthat lord, men young in years and fit for great deeds. And after the\r\nInfant returned from raising the siege of Ceuta, when the united power\r\nof those Moorish Kings had encircled it, these men begged him to put\r\nthem in the way to perform some honourable deed, like men who desired it\r\nmuch, for it seemed to them that their time was ill spent if they did\r\nnot toil in some undertaking with their bodies. And the Infant,\r\nperceiving their good wills, bade them make ready a vessel in which they\r\nwere to go on a warlike enterprise against the Moors, directing them to\r\nvoyage in search of the land of Guinea, which he already had purposed to\r\ndiscover.[N199] And since it pleased God to ordain such a benefit, both\r\nfor this Kingdom and also for many other parts, He guided them so that,\r\neven with the weather against them, they reached the island that is now\r\ncalled Porto Santo, being nigh to the island of Madeira, the which may\r\nbe seven leagues in circumference. And so they remained there for some\r\ndays and right well examined the land, and it seemed to them that it\r\nwould be a very profitable thing to people it. And returning thence to\r\nthe Kingdom, they spoke of it to the Infant, and described the goodness\r\nof the land and the desire they had as to its peopling; and this pleased\r\nthe Infant much, and he straightway took order for them to obtain what\r\nwas needful to enable them to return to the said island. And as they\r\nwere busied in the work of making ready for their departure, there\r\njoined himself to their company Bartholomew Perestrello, a nobleman of\r\nthe household of the Infant Don John; and these men, having all their\r\nthings ready, set out on their voyage to the said island. And it\r\nhappened that among the things they took with them to stock the said\r\nisland was a she-rabbit, which had been given to Bartholomew Perestrello\r\nby a friend of his, and the rabbit went in a hutch pregnant, and it came\r\nabout that it gave birth to young on the sea, and so they took all these\r\nto the island. And when they were lodged in their huts, to make ready\r\nhouses for themselves, they set free that female rabbit with her young\r\nto breed; and these in a very short time multiplied so much as to\r\noverspread the land, so that our men could sow nothing that was not\r\ndestroyed by them.\r\n\r\nAnd it is a marvel how they found in the year following their arrival,\r\nthat although they killed a very great quantity of these rabbits, there\r\nyet remained no lack of them. Wherefore they abandoned that island and\r\npassed over to the other isle of Madeira, which will be forty leagues in\r\ncircumference, and twelve leagues distant from Porto Santo; and there\r\nstayed the two, to wit, John Gonçalvez and Tristam, and Bartholomew\r\nPerestrello returned to the kingdom. This second island they discovered\r\nto be good, especially in very noble flowing waters, which are made to\r\nirrigate what part they will; and there they began to make very great\r\nsowings, from the which they obtained most abundant crops. From that\r\ntime they saw that the land had good air and was healthy, and they found\r\nmany birds, which in the beginning they were wont to capture in their\r\nhands, and they discovered many other good things in the said island. So\r\nthey let the Infant know all this, and he straightway laboured to send\r\nthere other people and ornaments for a church, and clerics, so that in a\r\nvery brief space a great portion of that land was put to use. And the\r\nInfant, considering how those two men were the pioneers of this\r\nsettlement, bestowed on them the chief governance of the island, to wit,\r\non John Gonçalvez Zarco, who was a noble man and had been made a knight\r\nat the siege of Tangier in a battle that the Infant won there upon a\r\nThursday, of which the history of the Kingdom maketh a fuller mention.\r\nAnd this John Gonçalvez had already been present at very great actions,\r\nand especially at the raising of the siege of Ceuta and the overthrow of\r\nthe Moors that took place on the day of arrival. And to this man the\r\nInfant gave the governance of the portion of the island called Funchal,\r\nand the other part called Machico[CI][N200] he bestowed on Tristam, who\r\nalso was dubbed a knight in a foray that was made at Ceuta; and he was a\r\nvery daring man, but not so noble in every other respect as John\r\nGonçalvez. And the beginning of the peopling of this island took place\r\nin the year of the birth of Jesus Christ one thousand and four hundred\r\nand twenty; and at the time of the making of this history it was peopled\r\nreasonably well, for there were in it one hundred and fifty inhabitants,\r\nbesides other persons such as traders and unmarried men and women and\r\nyouths, and boys and girls who had been born on the said island, as well\r\nas clerics and friars, and others who came and went for their\r\nmerchandise and for those things which they cannot dispense with in that\r\nisland. And in the year one thousand and four hundred and forty-five the\r\nInfant despatched a knight called Gonçallo Velho,[N201] who was a\r\nCommander of the Order of Christ, to go and people other two islands\r\nthat are distant from those one hundred and seventy leagues to the\r\nnorth-west. And one of these the Infant Don Pedro began to people with\r\nthe approval of his brother; but his death followed shortly, therefore\r\nit remained afterwards for the Infant Don Henry to continue this work.\r\nAnd to this island Don Pedro had assigned the name of St. Michael, on\r\naccount of the singular devotion which he had ever felt to that Saint.\r\nAnd the Infant Don Henry also caused to return to the island of Porto\r\nSanto, for the purpose of peopling it, Bartholomew Perestrello, the same\r\nman who had first voyaged there with John Gonçalvez and Tristam; but\r\nowing to the multitude of rabbits, which are almost without end, no\r\ntillage is possible there, but many cattle are reared there, and\r\ndragon's blood is also collected there and brought for sale to this\r\nKingdom, and taken to many other parts as well. And he turned out cattle\r\non another island which lieth seven leagues from the island of Madeira,\r\nintending to have it peopled like the other, and its name is Deserta.\r\nAnd of these seven islands, four are as large as that of Madeira and\r\nthree are smaller. And for the profit of the Order of Christ, whose\r\ngovernor the Infant was at the time of the said peopling, he gave the\r\nsaid Order all the revenues ecclesiastical of the island of Madeira and\r\nof Porto Santo and all the revenues both ecclesiastical and temporal of\r\nthe other island, of which he made Gonçallo Velho Commander. And beside\r\nall this he bequeathed to the said Order the tithes and half the sugar\r\nproduce of the Island of St. Michael.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote CI: In the text, \"Machito.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIV.\r\n\r\nOf how the Infant Don Henry required of the King the right over the\r\nCanaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1446 the Infant began to make ready his ships to return to\r\nthe said conquest, but before doing aught in the same, he requested the\r\nInfant Don Pedro, his brother, who at that time was ruling the Kingdom\r\nin the name of the King, to give him a Letter forbidding all the\r\nsubjects of these realms from daring to go to the Canary Islands, to\r\nmake war or treat of merchandise, without the command of the said\r\nInfant. This letter was granted him, and beside this he was privileged\r\nto enjoy a fifth of whatever should be brought from there; and this was\r\nvery rightly given him, considering the great expense which that noble\r\nPrince had incurred in the matter of the said conquest. And though we\r\nfound the substance of that letter set forth in the former book written\r\nby Affonso Cerveira, by aid of which we prosecute this history, yet we\r\ncare not to transcribe it, for it is no new thing to any one of\r\nexperience to see such writings, and well we know that their style would\r\nrather induce weariness in readers, so trite is it, than the desire to\r\nsee their accustomed reasonings.[N201a]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXV.\r\n\r\nOf how the caravel of Alvaro Dornellas returned, and of the Canarians\r\nthat he took.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow in this chapter it behoveth us to return to the action of Alvaro\r\nDornellas, about whom we wrote that he stayed in the Canary Islands. And\r\nhe let himself remain there out of shame, for it seemed to him that he\r\nwould be blamed if he were to turn back to the kingdom without any\r\nbooty, by means of which some portion of his toil might be known. And it\r\nwas so, that Affonso Marta brought his caravel, as we have told, and\r\nthis was despatched to the Madeira Islands. For here the said Alvaro\r\nDornellas ordered him to take in provisions against the price he should\r\nreceive for the sale of two Canarians that he forwarded in her, and he\r\nremained to pay those persons from whom he had borrowed them in\r\nmerchandise equal in value. But by the chance of the weather he failed\r\nto make the Islands, and was forced to enter the river-mouth at Lisbon,\r\nwhere at that season was one John Dornellas, an esquire of the King, a\r\nman of noble birth, brought up in the household of the King Don John and\r\nthe King Don Edward, and a cousin of this Alvaro Dornellas of whom we\r\nare speaking, who had an equal share with him in the ownership of the\r\nsaid caravel. And both were of one mind to go in her, only they accorded\r\nnot as to the date of their first departure, when John Dornellas\r\nreceived command of the King, ordering him to abstain for the time from\r\nmaking the said voyage, for so it was necessary for his service. And\r\nwhen that esquire saw how the caravel came, he knew the necessity in\r\nwhich his cousin must be, and he at once had provisions and men got\r\nready in haste so that the ship might be furnished, and he also took\r\nmerchandise, by means of which he thought his cousin might satisfy his\r\ndebt in respect of the captives he had taken. Now this John Dornellas\r\nwas a man of courage, and longed to accomplish great actions, and so he\r\nmade his voyage with despatch, although it was at great expense to\r\nhimself, and arrived in a short time at that island where his cousin\r\nwas, namely, the one called Fuerteventura. And Alvaro Dornellas arrived\r\nthere as soon as he knew of his coming, and taking aside his cousin, he\r\nsaid to him: \"In that I have informed these Castilians that this caravel\r\nis all mine (which I said that they might have cause to help me better\r\nin my actions, thinking that you would not come to this land, and also\r\nmore especially that I might fit out by their help a pinnace that is\r\nhere), I beg of you, even though this thing may be in some part a\r\nlessening of your honour, that for my sake you will be pleased to endure\r\nit, and advise all[CJ] to say none the less that the ship is mine, and\r\nthat as a thing of mine it arrived here, with all it containeth. And\r\nfrom this moment, dear cousin, it remaineth for you to command me in\r\nsome other matter, albeit a greater one, at a future time; and you may\r\nbe well assured that, beside the reasons I have, if I receive this\r\nfavour of you, I shall perform it with such good will as you shall see.\"\r\n\"By God, cousin,\" replied John Dornellas, \"though it be somewhat of a\r\nhardship for me to lessen my honour, being the man I am and with the\r\nupbringing I have had, yet I am well pleased to put all out of sight in\r\norder to do your will, although some of the men who come with me are\r\npersons of such rank that they have accompanied me here more out of\r\nfriendship than from hope of profit. For here I have Diego Vasquez\r\nPortocarreiro, an esquire of the King our lord, and other good men; but\r\nI will endeavour what I can in the business.\" And this in fact he did,\r\nso that all ended as Alvaro Dornellas desired. But this much you ought\r\nto know, that he acted afterwards quite contrary to what his words\r\nshowed. For but little time had passed when John Dornellas perceived his\r\ndeceit, and on account of this they were henceforth in very great\r\ncontention, and almost came to slaying one another over it, but the\r\nmatter is not fit unto this place. And so when both men came to this\r\nfirst agreement, they straightway armed the pinnace, and arrived in\r\ncompany at the Island of Gomera, where Alvaro Dornellas, as the captain,\r\nspake with the chief men of the island and asked them, on behalf of the\r\nInfant Don Henry, that they would give him some assistance to go to the\r\nisland of Palma to make some captures. And they with good will granted\r\nhim as much as he required. And so taking some of those Canarians to aid\r\nthem, they reached a port of the island of Palma, where they landed and\r\nat once concealed themselves in a valley, because it was in the day time\r\nand they feared to be discovered. But as soon as night fell, they began\r\nto journey through the island without any guide or sure path by which to\r\ndirect them to any certain part, but only at any venture that God might\r\nbe pleased to ordain for them, until they arrived at a place where they\r\nheard the barking of dogs, and knew by this that they were nigh to an\r\ninhabited spot. \"Now that we are already sure of that we seek,\" said\r\nsome, \"let us rest here in this valley, and very early, God permitting,\r\nwe will go against them, for our going now might bring to us rather\r\ninjury than benefit.\" And so they reposed there until they saw it was\r\ntime to attack their foes, and then they charged them with such vigour\r\nthat in a very brief space they captured twenty. And since the Canarians\r\ngave them much trouble in their attempts to deliver their relations and\r\nfriends, and also to avenge others who were left for dead, John\r\nDornellas said to his cousin that he should take the captives and go on\r\nin advance with them, and he would hold in check the others, so that\r\nthey might not diminish the booty; and in this stay, although they were\r\nhard pressed, yet they availed to escape from them, leaving fifteen of\r\nthem dead in that valley, and none of the Christians died, and only two\r\nwere wounded. And so they returned to the island of Gomera, where Alvaro\r\nDornellas was compelled to stay, while his cousin departed to the\r\nKingdom. But such lack of provisions overtook them that they looked for\r\nno other remedy than to eat some of those captives, as they felt they\r\ncould be saved in no other way. However, it pleased God that before they\r\ncame to this extremity, they made the port of Tavira,[CK] which is in\r\nthe kingdom of the Algarve.[N202]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote CJ: Your men.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote CK: The text has the old form, \"Tavilla.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVI.\r\n\r\nOf how Nuno Tristam was slain in the land of Guinea, and of those who\r\ndied with him.\r\n\r\n\r\nAh, in what brief words do I find enregistered[N202a] the record of the\r\ndeath of such a noble knight as was this Nuno Tristam, of whose sudden\r\nend I purpose to speak in the present chapter. And of a surety I could\r\nnot pass it by without tears, did I not know, almost by divine forecast,\r\nthe eternal delight his soul tasteth, for it seemeth to me that I should\r\nbe reckoned as covetous by all true Catholics were I to bewail the death\r\nof one whom it hath pleased God to make a sharer in His immortality. And\r\nof a surety, inasmuch as he was the first knight who by himself bestowed\r\nthat honour[CL] on another in that land, and as I made a commencement of\r\nthis book with an account of the booty he obtained, so did I feel almost\r\nresolved to conclude it with his death, giving to his divine soul the\r\nprimary seat of celestial glory as the firstfruits of all the others\r\nwho for God's sake were to meet their end in that land. Now this noble\r\nknight was perfectly informed of the great desire and purpose of our\r\nvirtuous Prince, being one who from such an early youth had been brought\r\nup in his household; and seeing how the Prince was toiling to send his\r\nships to the land of the Negroes and much further yet, if he might\r\naccomplish it; and hearing that some caravels had already passed the\r\nriver of Nile, and the things that were reported from there; it seemed\r\nto him that if he were not to make himself one of that elect company and\r\nto render service to the Infant his lord in that land in any good thing\r\nthat might be done or encountered there, he could not obtain the name of\r\na good man and true. Wherefore he straightway made him ready a caravel,\r\nand having it armed, he began his voyage and stayed not in any part, but\r\npursued his course toward the land of the Negroes. And passing by Cape\r\nVerde, he went sixty leagues further on and came unto a river, in the\r\nwhich it seemed to him that there ought to be some inhabited places.\r\nWherefore he caused to be launched two small boats he was carrying, and\r\nin them there entered twenty-two men, to wit, ten in one and twelve in\r\nthe other. And as they began to take their way up the river, the tide\r\nwas rising with the which they entered, and they made for some\r\nhabitations that they espied on the right hand. And it came to pass that\r\nbefore they went on shore, there appeared from the other side twelve\r\nboats, in the which there would be as many as seventy or eighty Guineas,\r\nall Negroes, with bows in their hands. And because the water was rising,\r\none of the boats of the Guineas crossed to the other side and put on\r\nshore those it was carrying, and thence they began to shoot arrows at\r\nour men in the boats. And the others[CM] who remained in the boats\r\nbestirred themselves as much as they could to get at our men, and as\r\nsoon as they perceived themselves to be within reach, they discharged\r\nthat accursed ammunition of theirs all full of poison upon the bodies of\r\nour countrymen. And so they held on in pursuit of them until they had\r\nreached the caravel which was lying outside the river in the open sea;\r\nand they[CN] were all hit by those poisoned arrows, in such wise that\r\nbefore they came on board four of them died in the boats. And so,\r\nwounded as they were, they made fast their small boats to the ship, and\r\ncommenced to make ready for their voyage, seeing their case, how\r\nperilous it was; but they were not able to lift their anchors for the\r\nmultitude of arrows with which they were attacked, and they were\r\nconstrained to cut the cables so that not one remained. And so they\r\nbegan to make sail, leaving the boats behind, for they could not hoist\r\nthem up. And it came to pass that of the twenty-two men that left the\r\nship only two escaped, to wit, one André Diaz and another Alvaro da\r\nCosta, both esquires of the Infant and natives of the City of Evora; and\r\nthe remaining nineteen[CO] died, for that poison was so artfully\r\ncomposed that a slight wound, if it only let blood, brought men to their\r\nlast end. And there died that noble Knight Nuno Tristam,[N203] very\r\ndesirous as he was of this present life, in that there was no place left\r\nhim to buy his death like a brave man. And there died also another\r\nKnight called John Correa and one Duarte Dollanda and Estevam Dalmeida\r\nand Diego Machado, men of noble birth and young in years, brought up by\r\nthe Infant in his household; as well as other esquires and foot soldiers\r\nof the same upbringing; and seamen and others of the ship's company.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote CL: Of knighthood.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote CM: Guineas.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote CN: Our men.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote CO: Not counting Tristam himself.]\r\n\r\nSuffice it to say that they numbered in all twenty-one,[N203a] for of\r\nthe seven that had remained in the caravel two were also wounded as they\r\nwere trying to raise the anchors. But whom will you have to make ready\r\nthis ship that she may pursue her voyage and depart from among that evil\r\nrace? for the two esquires who remained, as we said, did not wholly\r\nescape from that peril, for being wounded they came near unto death, and\r\nlay ill quite twenty days, not being able to render any aid to the\r\nothers who were toiling to direct the caravel. And these latter were not\r\nmore than five in number, to wit, a sailor lad very little acquainted\r\nwith the art of navigating, and a boy of the Infant's household called\r\nAiras Tinoco, who went as purser, and a Guinea boy who had been captured\r\nwith the first prisoners taken in that land, and two other boys, both\r\nquite young, who were living with some of those esquires that died\r\nthere. Of a surety, compassion is due to their great toil at that hour.\r\nThey went weeping and sorrowing for the death of such a captain and of\r\nthe others their comrades and friends, and were from that time in fear\r\nof the hateful enemies they knew to be near them, from whose deadly\r\nwounds so many and such brave men had died in a very brief space. And\r\nespecially they sorrowed because they found so slight a remedy whereby\r\nto seek their safety; for the sailor lad, in whom they were all putting\r\ntheir hope, confessed openly his scant knowledge, saying that he knew\r\nnot how to direct the course of a ship or to work at anything of that\r\nkind in such wise as to be serviceable; but only if directed by another\r\nhe would do what he could, as he was bidden. O, Thou great and supreme\r\nsuccour of all the forsaken and afflicted, who dost never desert those\r\nthat cry out to Thee in their most great necessity, and who now didst\r\nhear the cries of these men who made their moan to Thee, fixing their\r\neyes on the height of the clouds and calling upon Thee to hasten to\r\ntheir aid; clearly didst Thou show that Thou heardest their prayers when\r\nin such a brief space Thou didst send them heavenly aid. For Thou didst\r\ngive courage and understanding to a youth who had been born and brought\r\nup in Olivença, an inland town far removed from the sea; and he,\r\nenlightened by divine grace, piloted the ship, and bade the seaman steer\r\ndirectly to the north, declining a little to the east, namely, to the\r\nwind that is called north-east, for he thought that there lay the\r\nkingdom of Portugal, towards which they wished to make their voyage. And\r\nas they were going thus on their way, after a part of the day was over,\r\nthey went to see Nuno Tristam and the other wounded men, and they found\r\nthem dead, so that they were obliged to throw them into the sea; and on\r\nthat day they threw in fifteen, and four remained in the boats, and two\r\nthey threw in the next day. But I write not of the feelings that would\r\nbe theirs when they cast those bodies upon the multitude of waters,\r\nburying their flesh in the bellies of fish. But what importeth it to us\r\nif our bodies lack sepulture? since in our own flesh we shall see our\r\nSaviour, according to the determination of Holy Scripture, for it is the\r\nsame thing whether we lie in the sea or the land, and whether we be\r\neaten of fishes or of birds. Our chief concern is in those works of ours\r\nby which after our death we shall find the truth of all these matters\r\nthat here we see in figure; and since we all believe and confess that\r\nthe Pope is our Chief Vicar and Supreme Pontiff, through whose power we\r\nshall be able to receive absolution or condemnation, according to the\r\nauthority of the Gospel, we are as true Catholics bound to believe that\r\nthose whom he shall absolve, if they fulfil the conditions of his\r\ndecree, will be placed in the company of the saints. Therefore we can\r\nsay with justice to these men: \"Beati mortui qui in Domino moriuntur.\"\r\nAnd moreover, all who read this history will obtain a reward from God,\r\nif they make a memorial of the death of these men in their prayers, for\r\ninasmuch as they died in the service of God and their lord, their death\r\nis happy. Now this youth whom I have mentioned was that same Airas\r\nTinoco of whom I spoke above, and in him God put such grace that for two\r\nmonths together he directed the course of that ship; but all were\r\ndoubtful what their end would be, for in all those two months they never\r\ncaught sight of land. And at the end of this time they sighted a pinnace\r\nwhich was on warlike business, and they had great fear at the sight, for\r\nthey thought it belonged to Moors; but after they found it pertained to\r\na Galician pirate whose name was Pero Falcom, a new joy came upon them,\r\nand much more so when they were told that they were off the coast of\r\nPortugal, opposite a place belonging to the Master-ship of Santiago,\r\ncalled Sines.[N204] And so they arrived at Lagos, and thence they went\r\nto the Infant to tell him of the tragical fortune of their voyage, and\r\nlaid before him the multitude of arrows by the which their companions\r\nhad died. The Infant had great displeasure at the loss of these men, for\r\nwellnigh the whole number of them had he brought up, and although he\r\nwell believed that their souls had found salvation, yet could he not\r\nprevent a sorrow for that humanity which was brought up in his presence\r\nfor the space of so many years. And so, like a lord who felt that their\r\ndeaths had come to pass in his service, he afterward had an especial\r\ncare of their wives and children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVII.\r\n\r\nOf how Alvaro Fernandez returned again to the land of the Negroes, and\r\nof the things he accomplished there.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the signs by which a noble heart is recognised is that it hath no\r\ncontentment in small matters, but ever seeketh some betterment, that its\r\nhonour may be increased among the deeds of the noble both in its own\r\nland and outside it. And this may we justly say of John Gonçalvez,\r\ncaptain of the island;[CP] for he, not satisfied by the other voyage\r\nthat his ship had made in the previous year to the land of the Negroes,\r\nmade ready once more to dispatch there that same Alvaro Fernandez with\r\nhis caravel well armed, and charged him to make his way still further\r\nonward to the utmost of his power, and to toil for some booty which by\r\nits novelty and greatness might give testimony of the good will he had\r\nto serve that lord who had brought him up. Now Alvaro Fernandez\r\nundertook this matter as an honourable burden, like one who had no less\r\ndesire[CQ] to carry through the mandate which his uncle had laid upon\r\nhim. And when the ship had been provisioned, they made their voyage\r\nstraight to Cape Verde, whereat in the past year they had captured the\r\ntwo Guineas of whom we have spoken in another place, and thence they\r\npassed on to the Cape of Masts,[N205] and made a stay there to put some\r\nmen on shore. And for the sole purpose of seeing the land, seven of them\r\njoined together, and these, when they had been landed upon the beach,\r\ndiscovered the footprints of men leading along a certain path. And they\r\nfollowed them up and reached a well where they found goats, which it\r\nseemeth the Guineas had left there, and this would be, I think, because\r\nthey perceived that they were being followed. The Christians went so far\r\nand no further, for they dared not pursue their course, and returning to\r\ntheir caravel, they voyaged on, and putting out their boat, found on\r\nland some elephant's dung of the bigness of a man, according to the\r\njudgment of those that saw it; and because it seemed not a place wherein\r\nto make booty they returned again to their caravel. And so journeying\r\nalong the sea coast, in a few days they went on shore again, and came\r\nupon a village, and its inhabitants issued forth like men who showed\r\nthey had a will to defend their houses, and among them came one armed\r\nwith a good buckler and an assegai in his hand. And Alvaro Fernandez\r\nseeing him, and judging him to be the leader of the band, went stoutly\r\nat him, and gave him such a great wound with his lance that he fell down\r\ndead, and then he took from him his shield and assegai; and these he\r\nbrought home to the Infant along with some other things, as will be\r\nrelated further on.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote CP: Madeira.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote CQ: Than his uncle.]\r\n\r\nNow the Guineas, perceiving that man to be dead, paused from their\r\nfighting, and it appeared to our men to be neither the time nor the\r\nplace to withdraw them from that fear. But rather they returned to their\r\nship and on the next day landed a little way distant from there, where\r\nthey espied some of the wives of those Guineas walking. And it seemeth\r\nthat they were going nigh to a creek collecting shell-fish, and they\r\ncaptured one of them, who would be as much as thirty years of age, with\r\na son of hers who would be of about two, and also a young girl of\r\nfourteen years, who had well-formed limbs and also a favourable presence\r\nfor a Guinea; but the strength of the woman was much to be marvelled at,\r\nfor not one of the three men who came upon her but would have had a\r\ngreat labour in attempting to get her to the boat. And so one of our\r\nmen, seeing the delay they were making, during which it might be that\r\nsome of the dwellers of the land would come upon them, conceived it well\r\nto take her son from her and to carry him to the boat; and love of the\r\nchild compelled the mother to follow after it, without great pressure on\r\nthe part of the two who were bringing her. From this place they went on\r\nfurther for a certain distance until they lighted upon a river,[N206]\r\ninto the which they entered with the boat, and in some houses that they\r\nfound they captured a woman, and after they had brought her to the\r\ncaravel, they returned once more to the river, intending to journey\r\nhigher up in order to try and make some good booty. And as they were\r\npursuing their voyage thus, there came upon them four or five boats of\r\nGuineas prepared like men who would defend their land, and our men in\r\nthe boat were not desirous to try a combat with them, seeing the great\r\nadvantage their enemies had, and especially because they feared the\r\ngreat peril that lay in the poison with which they shot. And so they\r\nbegan to retreat to their ship as well as they could, but seeing how one\r\nof those boats was much in front of the others, they turned round upon\r\nit, but it retired towards its companions, and as our men were trying to\r\nreach it before it escaped (for it seemeth that it was already distant a\r\ngood way from the company) their boat came so near that one of those\r\nGuineas made a shot at it and happened to hit Alvaro Fernandez with an\r\narrow in the leg. But since he had already been warned of its poison, he\r\ndrew out that arrow very quickly and had the wound washed with urine and\r\nolive oil, and then anointed it very well with theriack, and it pleased\r\nGod that it availed him, although his health was in very troublous case,\r\nfor during certain days he was in the very act of passing away from\r\nlife. The others on the caravel, although they saw their captain thus\r\nwounded, desisted not from voyaging forward along that coast until they\r\narrived at a narrow strip of sand stretching in front of a great bay,\r\nand here they put out their boat and went inside to see what kind of\r\nland they would find; and when they were in sight of the beach they saw\r\ncoming toward them full 120 Guineas, some with shields and assegais,\r\nothers with bows. And as soon as they came near the water these began to\r\nplay and dance like men far removed from any sorrow; but our men in the\r\nboat, wishful to escape from the invitation to that festival, returned\r\nto their ship. And this took place 110 leagues beyond Cape Verde,[N207]\r\nand all that coast trendeth commonly to the south. And this caravel went\r\nfurther this year than all the others, wherefore with right good will a\r\nguerdon of 200 doubloons was granted unto it, that is to say 100 which\r\nthe Infant Don Pedro, who was then Regent, ordered to be given, and\r\nanother 100 which it obtained from the Infant Don Henry. And had it not\r\nbeen for the illness of Alvaro Fernandez, by which he was much disabled,\r\nthe caravel would have gone further still, but it was obliged to return\r\nfrom that last place I have mentioned, and it came straight to the Isle\r\nof Arguim, and thence to the Cape of the Ransom, where they found that\r\nAhude Meymam of whom we have already spoken at times in this history.\r\nAnd although they did not carry an interpreter, yet by making signs they\r\nobtained a negress, whom the Moors gave them in exchange for some cloths\r\nthey brought with them, and had they not brought so little they could\r\nhave obtained much more, judging by the desire that the Moors showed.\r\nAnd thence they made their voyage towards the Kingdom, where they\r\nreceived the doubloons as I have already said, together with many other\r\nguerdons from the Infant their lord, who was very joyful at their coming\r\non account of the advance they had made in their expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVIII.\r\n\r\nOf how the nine caravels departed from Lagos, and of the Moors they\r\ncaptured.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the news of the death of Nuno Tristam caused in many people of\r\nour Kingdom a great fear of following up the war they had commenced; for\r\nthe one party said to the other that it was a very doubtful matter to\r\nundertake fighting with men who so plainly carried death about with\r\nthem; yet there were not wanting men to attempt the enterprise with good\r\nwill. For manifest as the danger was, yet sufficient for all things were\r\nthe hearts of those who would fain earn the name of good men; and\r\nespecially were they moved to this by the knowledge they had of the\r\nInfant's desire and by seeing the great increasements that he made to\r\nthose who toiled thereat, for, as Vegetius saith, \"Men are valiant where\r\nvalour is rewarded.\" And so in this year certain captains, with nine\r\ncaravels, were moved to go to that land of the Negroes; and of these the\r\nfirst was Gil Eannes, a knight who dwelt in the town of Lagos. And the\r\nsecond was a noble esquire brought up in the Infant's household from\r\nearly boyhood. Now this was a very bold youth, and none the less endowed\r\nwith many other good qualities, and you will find his deeds writ more\r\nfully in the Chronicle of the Kingdom, and especially where it speaketh\r\nof the great deeds that were achieved in Ceuta; and this man's name was\r\nFrancisco Vallarinho. The third was that Stevam Affonso of whom we have\r\nalready spoken in other places of this our history, and he had under his\r\ncaptaincy three caravels. There was Laurence Diaz, of whom we have also\r\nspoken ere now, and Laurence Delvas and John Bernaldez, a pilot, each of\r\nwhom brought his caravel. And there was moreover in this company a\r\ncaravel belonging to the Bishop of Algarve, which an esquire of his\r\ncommanded. And these,[CR] by the Infant's ordinance, went to the Island\r\nof Madeira to take in their supplies; and from the said Island there\r\ndeparted, with these caravels that went from this land,[CS] two ships,\r\nto wit, one commanded by its owner, Tristam, one of the captains who\r\nlived in the isle, and another in which sailed Garcia Homem, son-in-law\r\nto John Gonçalvez Zarco, the other captain. And so making their voyage\r\nall together, they arrived at the Island of Gomera, and here they landed\r\nthe nineteen Canarians who had been captured in spite of the sureties,\r\nas you have heard further back; and they also took up certain men who\r\nhad remained there belonging to the Infant's household and to the Island\r\nof Madeira. \"Now,\" said those on the ships to the Canarians of that\r\nisland, \"we would fain try our fortune in the Island of Palma, if\r\nperchance we can make any booty wherewith to do service to the Infant\r\nour lord; and we would know for our better despatch if it will please\r\nyou to give us some of your men who are ready to help us.\" \"You know\r\nalready,\" replied the Canarians by means of their interpreters, \"that\r\neverything which is for the service of the Infant we will do with all\r\nour power.\" And true it is that they all went to the said island; but\r\ntheir going availed them nought, because the Canarians were already\r\nforewarned by sight of the caravel of Laurence Diaz, which had arrived\r\nthere some days before. And after the great labour they had gone through\r\nin this affair, the two caravels of the Island returned, perceiving that\r\nthey could not make any booty. But Gil Eannes, that knight of Lagos, and\r\nthe others, pursued their voyage until they arrived sixty leagues beyond\r\nCape Verde, where they met with a river which was of a good width, and\r\ninto it they entered with their caravels;[N208] but that entry was not\r\nvery profitable for the Bishop's caravel, forasmuch as it chanced to\r\ntouch on a sand-bank and sprang a leak, in such wise that they could not\r\nget it off any more; but the crew escaped with everything they cared to\r\ntake from it. And while some were occupied with this, Stevam Affonso and\r\nhis brother went on shore; but the inhabitants were in another part, and\r\nintending to go in search of them they departed from there, guiding\r\nthemselves by the glimpse of a track they found near the place. And\r\nafter pursuing their way for some little distance they said they found\r\nmuch of the land sown, and many cotton trees and many fields sown with\r\nrice, and also other trees of different kinds. And he[CT] said that all\r\nthat land seemed to him like marshes.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote CR: Caravels.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote CS: Portugal.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote CT: Stevam.]\r\n\r\nAnd it appeareth that Diegaffonso had gone on in front before the\r\nothers, and with him fifteen of those who had a pre-eminent desire to\r\nachieve some deed, among whom was a youth of the Infant's household\r\ncalled John Villes, who was with them as purser. And as they were\r\nentering into a very thick grove of trees, the Guineas issued out\r\nagainst them from one side with their assegais and bows, and came as\r\nnear them as they could, and Fortune so willed it that of the seven who\r\nwere wounded five died straightway on the spot, of whom two were\r\nPortuguese and three strangers. And as the affair was at this point,\r\nStevam Affonso arrived with the others who were coming behind. And he,\r\nseeing the perilous place they were in, brought them all back as best he\r\ncould, and in this retirement they had not a little trouble, because the\r\nGuineas were numerous and carried hurtful weapons, even as you perceive\r\nthose were which in such a brief space killed our men. And at this time\r\nfour youths who were brought up in the Infant's household received a\r\npre-eminent meed of praise, and the chief of them was that Diego\r\nGonçalvez, a noble esquire, of whose manly parts we have already left an\r\naccount in other places. Another was one Henry Lourenço, who was also a\r\nyouth desirous of toil for the increase of his honour. And of the other\r\ntwo one had for his name Affonseannes, and one Fernandeannes. And as\r\nsoon as they arrived at their caravels they held a council and agreed to\r\nreturn, seeing that they were already discovered, and that their ships\r\nwere overflowing with the crew they had taken from the Bishop's caravel.\r\nBut although they gave this reason, I hold that the principal cause of\r\ntheir departure was the fear of their enemies, whose terrible manner of\r\nfighting was such as to strike any man of understanding with great\r\nterror. For it cannot be named true courage, unless they had some other\r\nand greater need of fighting, willingly to enter into combat with men\r\nwho they knew had the power to do them so much injury. And there\r\nremained the bodies of those dead men among the thickness of the trees,\r\nand their souls departed to see the things of the other world; and may\r\nit please God, if they are not yet in His holy kingdom, to take them to\r\nHimself. And for pity's sake, all ye others that hold the Christian\r\nfaith, say your prayers for them, for in asking for them ye ask for\r\nyourselves also. And the caravels returning as they had arranged,\r\narrived at the Island of Arguim to provide themselves with water, of\r\nwhich they had need. And then they determined to go to the Cape of the\r\nRansom,[N209] where they went on shore and found the track of some\r\nMoors. And although by reason of the heat a journey by land was very\r\nperilous, yet considering that they were returning without booty to the\r\nkingdom, they felt constrained to adventure the risk, and so they began\r\nto follow up that track until after two leagues they reached the Moors\r\nand with little labour captured eight and forty of them. And thence they\r\nresolved to make their way straight to the Kingdom; and so in truth did\r\nall save only Stevam Affonso, who sailed to the Island of Palma, where\r\nhe went on shore with the greater part of those he brought with him. And\r\nthere they happened to light at once upon some Canarians, of whom they\r\ntook two women; but this was not fated to pass without a very harmful\r\nreturn on the part of the enemy. For they turned upon our men as they\r\nwere carrying off the booty, and attacked them so boldly that there were\r\nsome there who would willingly have left a part of that spoil to any who\r\nwould have secured them from destruction. But that bold and good esquire\r\nDiego Gonçalvez, forgetting not his courage, stoutly took a crossbow\r\nfrom the hands of one of those archers there, and also the bolts and\r\nquiver, and placing himself among our men shot at the Canarians; and so\r\nmuch did he toil in the using of his arrows that in a very brief space\r\nhe killed seven of those enemies. And among them there died one of their\r\nkings, who was recognised by a palm he carried in his hand, for it\r\nseemeth that their custom is for a king to have that pre-eminence among\r\nthe others. And as you know that with all men it is a natural thing that\r\nwhen the chief dieth all the others do fly, so those men, seeing their\r\ncaptain to be dead, ceased from their fighting, giving place to our men\r\nthat they might put themselves in safety; and so they came to the\r\nKingdom with their booty, although one of those Canarian women died\r\nbefore they disembarked at the town of Lagos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIX.\r\n\r\nHow Gomez Pirez went to the Rio do Ouro, and of the Moors that he\r\ncaptured.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen this year of 1446 arrived, Gomez Pirez remembered what he had said\r\nto the Moors when he came to the Rio do Ouro in the year preceding; and\r\nforasmuch as he could not pass to that land without the licence and aid\r\nof the Infant, he began to require of him that he would assist him to go\r\nwhither he had promised the Moors to return. And omitting some other\r\nreasonings that passed between them the Infant granted him the said\r\nlicence and made him ready two caravels, that is to say, one decked and\r\nthe other a fishing-boat, in which were twenty men (or with Gomez Pirez\r\none and twenty), and among them was a youth of the Infant's household\r\ncalled John Gorizo, who had it in charge to write down all the receipts\r\nand expenses with the Moors.[N210] And it was already the accustomed\r\nthing for all the ships that were sent out by the Infant, when they left\r\nthis realm, to go first of all to the Island of Madeira to take in their\r\nvictuals; and so soon as they arrived there Gomez Pirez spake with that\r\npurser and said that he would depart immediately towards the Rio do Ouro\r\nin the smaller caravel; and that John Gorizo should remain in the other\r\nand take in the things they had to carry; and that when the latter\r\narrived there he[CU] would have arranged his traffic with the Moors. And\r\nso the first caravel departed, and arrived at the entering in of the Rio\r\ndo Ouro, where they lay on their anchors for a space. \"Let us go,\" said\r\nGomez Pirez to the men he brought with him, \"to the end of this river,\r\nwhere I promised the Moors the year before that I would come and\r\ntraffic, for there is no reason in our staying here, since the Moors\r\nappear not.\" And so they made their voyage there and arrived at a port\r\ncalled Porto da Caldeira,[N211] where they cast anchor. And in order\r\nthat the Moors might have knowledge of their coming, on the day after\r\ntheir arrival Gomez Pirez bade them make a small smoky fire on a hill\r\nthat was near the port. And when he saw that they came not on that day\r\nhe had another made, and others also by night and by day until, after\r\nthree days were passed, the Moors began to arrive, and Gomez Pirez began\r\nto speak with them by means of his interpreters, asking them to have\r\nsome Guineas brought there, in exchange for whom he would give them\r\ncloth. \"We,\" replied they, \"are not merchants, nor are there any near\r\nhere, but they are all engaged in trafficking in the Upland; yet, if\r\nthey knew it, they would make great endeavour to come here, for they are\r\nmen well supplied both with Guineas and gold, as well as some other\r\nthings with which you might be well content.\"[N212] Then spake Gomez\r\nPirez to some of those men, and asked them to go and summon them, saying\r\nhe would give them a certain fee for it; but the Moors received the\r\nmoney and pretended they were going to call them, but in the end they\r\nwould never put themselves to the trouble of it, although Gomez Pirez\r\nwaited there for the space of one-and-twenty days. And so full of trust\r\nwere the Moors toward our men that five or six of them willingly entered\r\ninto the caravel, and meanwhile there arrived the other ship of John\r\nGorizo, which had remained in the Island. And when the one-and-twenty\r\ndays were passed, and Gomez Pirez perceived how the Moors were cheating\r\nhim, and how they would not go and summon the merchants, he said to them\r\nthat until then he had granted them security in the name of the Lord\r\nInfant his lord, but that since they did not deal straightly, from\r\nhenceforth they were to beware of him and to consider the security as\r\nended. And so forthwith he drave out all the men he had in the caravel,\r\nand made sail forthwith, moving away four leagues from thence to the\r\nother side of the river; and on the day after he had arrived there, he\r\nsaw two Moors coming towards the beach, and these by his command were\r\ncaptured in brief space. Gomez Pirez spake with them apart, and asked\r\nthem if they had news of any other Moors being at hand. \"We know,\"\r\nreplied they, \"that ten are gone to an island that is at the end of this\r\nriver, and that there is an inhabited place near there in which there\r\nwill be some forty or fifty souls.\" \"Now, since this is so,\" said Gomez\r\nPirez to John Gorizo, \"make you ready six of your other men and take one\r\nof these boats and go on shore in search of those Moors who are in the\r\nisland, as this man telleth me; and be careful,\" added he, \"that you\r\nfind a way to seize them before they throw themselves into the water,\r\nbecause I hear that all are very expert swimmers, and they might escape\r\nyou if you were not advised of this.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote CU: Pirez.]\r\n\r\nSo these men departed, and Gomez Pirez had another boat made ready, in\r\nthe which he put eleven men with himself and went on shore, and there he\r\nspake to them in this wise: \"My friends, you well know how we are come\r\nto this part chiefly to do service to God, and then to the Lord Infant\r\nour master, and all this not without a profitable return for ourselves.\r\nAnd because I have learned that in front of that island whither I\r\ndespatched those other companions of ours, there is a village containing\r\nsome forty or fifty souls, the most that can fight therein will number\r\nfrom twenty to five and twenty, and I truly believe that if we go\r\nagainst them as we ought, we shall make a great booty among them without\r\ngrave peril to ourselves. Wherefore my advice is that we set out against\r\nthem forthwith, so that if any of those on the island escape, they may\r\nnot be able to give the news of our coming to warn our foe and to cause\r\nhim to flee. And this I make known to you as a man who desireth your\r\ncounsel and approval.\" \"What needeth there,\" replied the others, \"any\r\nmore talking or taking of counsel, but rather go you whither you wish,\r\nand God be with you. We will follow as we ought; for in regard to a man\r\nof such authority, and one who hath seen and passed through so many\r\ndangers both on sea and land, it would be matter of scorn if any of us\r\nwere to think of correcting what you had determined.\" Now let us leave\r\nthese men in their good purpose and speak of the six who went to the\r\nisland; for these put all their energy in rowing their boat to arrive at\r\nthat Island before the tide ebbed, because the Moors could easily escape\r\nat low water. And when they came near it, they agreed that four of them\r\nshould go on shore and that two should proceed in the boat along the\r\nland, so that if the Moors attempted to throw themselves into the water,\r\nthey could easily seize them, and also that if it were needful for them\r\nto leap forth and help their companions, they could do so. And as the\r\nfour were making their way by land, the Moors caught sight of them, and\r\neither because they were men of courage or because they thought they had\r\nan advantage, they straightway rushed upon the Christians, hurling their\r\nassegais at a very short distance from them. These our men received upon\r\ntheir shields, and then they came to close combat, in which the four men\r\nhad the better of the enemy, but the two men who were in the boat seeing\r\nclearly the toil of their companions, sprang upon land to aid them, and\r\ntheir coming was a sign of defeat for the foe, who began at once to\r\nretire and then altogether took to flight. And of the ten, which was the\r\nnumber of the Moors, two who tried to throw themselves into the water\r\nwere drowned forthwith, either because they knew not well how to swim or\r\nfor some other hindrance. And when the Christians saw that they were\r\nthrowing themselves into the water, they leapt into their boat, and so\r\ninside and out they captured the eight. And when they had them bound,\r\nJohn Gorizo said to the others: \"Let us go to the land whither we saw\r\nGomez Pirez faring in the other boat, for he departed immediately after\r\nus, and of a surety it was only because he willed to attack the village\r\nwhich the Moors told him was situate there. And since we have now\r\naccomplished our undertaking, let us go and aid him, for perchance he\r\nwill need our help, or at any rate they will at least know our good\r\nwill.\" And this John Gorizo said, because when they were going to the\r\nIsland, they well perceived the course that the other boat was taking.\r\nAnd all held this counsel to be good; and so leaving these men now to\r\nfollow their way to where Gomez Pirez goeth, let us speak of the fortune\r\nof the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XC.\r\n\r\nOf the Moors that Gomez Pirez took in the other village.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturning now to the deed of Gomez Pirez, let us suppose that council to\r\nbe ended and consider that they are faring on their way, guided by those\r\nMoors whose words persuaded them to leave their ship. And it was so,\r\nthat as they were already going near unto where they were told the\r\nvillage stood, they espied the Moors coming out of their encampment, and\r\nGomez Pirez, catching sight of them, shouted lustily to the others to\r\npursue them. \"Run,\" said he, \"for all our victory is in the speed of our\r\nfeet, as you see that the foemen are beginning to make them ready.\" And\r\nhis command was more than enough in their ears, for hardly had he\r\nuttered the first word, when they were already among the Moors, and\r\ncrying out \"Santiago\" and \"Portugal,\" in a very brief space they leapt\r\ninto the middle of the village, and there at the first onset seized one\r\nand twenty of those people, what of men, women, and children. But I\r\nbelieve the most of these would be such as could not flee, for of the\r\ntwelve Christians who reached that place, four separated themselves from\r\nthe rest and ran after those that were flying; yet their toil availed\r\nthem little, for they could never come up with them to take them, and at\r\nlast their strength commenced to fail and they started to turn back. And\r\nas they were returning to their ships, well content with their victory,\r\nthey met with the others who were coming to their aid, and there was\r\nunited an almost equal joyfulness, for each party on its side was\r\ncontent with the victory it had gained, and much more because this had\r\nbeen without any loss. And so they went to their ships, where they took\r\nrest with the victuals they had, offering one to the other with a right\r\ngood will, as is done in places where the like meetings take place, for\r\na common proverb saith: \"A poor man hath joy in a little.\" Gomez Pirez\r\nwould not allow himself altogether to rest upon this victory, and\r\ncontent himself with what he had already gained, but while the others\r\nwere in converse he took aside one of those Moors and asked him if he\r\nknew of any inhabited place near at hand. And he replied that he only\r\nknew one, but it was six leagues off, and this would hold not less than\r\na hundred souls. \"It were all one,\" said Gomez Pirez, \"if there were\r\nthree hundred of them, for we will go on all the same, since we are at\r\nthe matter;\" and so he ordered sail to be made on the sudden, and\r\ndirected his ships whither the Moor pointed out to him that the village\r\nlay. And when he perceived that he was already four leagues from the\r\nplace he had left, he had his boat put on shore with seventeen men of\r\nthose he thought the best and the most daring, and three he left to\r\nguard the caravels. And then he had the Moor put in front as a guide.\r\nAnd because it seemeth they went by night, and the Moor knew not\r\ncertainly where the place lay, but could only make guess of it, they\r\nwould have passed it by, had it not been for the barking of a dog, by\r\nwhose voice they discovered the place where the Moors were lying and\r\nturned back on them. But when they had reached the village, morning\r\ncommenced to break, so that part of the Moors were already gone afield.\r\nHowever, with their accustomed cry, they came upon the place, and though\r\nthe Moors defended themselves, they captured one and thirty of them; and\r\nI think this would be because it appeareth that the greater and\r\nprincipal men were already away, and the others that remained were old\r\nmen and women and children. And they straightway asked of these what had\r\nbecome of the others who had departed thence? \"They are,\" answered they,\r\n\"three leagues from here toward the sea-shore, whither they went in\r\nsearch of food for themselves and for us.\" \"Well, then,\" said Gomez\r\nPirez, \"my purpose is that we should go against them, for since we have\r\nalready undertaken this toil, we should err if we did not make an end of\r\nit; wherefore eat something if you have it with you, that you may take\r\nsome refreshment, and let us use one of these men to direct us to where\r\nthese Moors are.\" True it is there were some there who would willingly\r\nhave rested, if the contrary reasonings of the captain and of other some\r\nwho agreed with his design had not prevented them. \"Take two men of this\r\ncompany,\" said Gomez Pirez to John Fernandez (that good esquire of whom\r\nwe have already told you how he went seven months in that land), \"and\r\nconduct these Moors to the ships, and we will go in search of the others\r\nwho left here before we arrived to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCI.\r\n\r\nOf what happened to John Fernandez when he was taking along the Moors.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow as John Fernandez was going on his way with his prisoners in front\r\nof him, feeling not very sure that he would not find some foemen who\r\nperchance would make him lose his booty; and as he was looking around\r\nhim on every side, for the land was level;[N213] he happened to espy,\r\nsome distance off, five persons coming towards him. And he was very glad\r\nat the sight, because it appeared to him that they were coming straight\r\nfor him; but he began to ponder thereon. \"Now,\" said he to the others,\r\n\"you can see those Moors there how they are coming straight for us.\r\nMeseemeth they are five while we are three, and one of us must needs\r\nguard the prisoners; so do you,\" quoth he to John Bertollomeu, \"remain\r\nwith them in the rear, and Lourenceannes and I will move on towards\r\nthose who are coming, and we will go straight against them. For the\r\nfurther off we fight from these prisoners so much the more will it be to\r\nour advantage, since it might happen that they would mingle with those\r\nwe have and it would be an occasion for some of the last to get free.\"\r\nAnd on this they began to pursue their way straight toward those who\r\ncame against them, thinking they were fighting Moors, but they found it\r\nquite otherwise, for all five were women, and these they took with right\r\ngood will, as something that increased their capital without toil; and\r\nthen they conducted them with the others to their ships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCII.\r\n\r\nHow Gomez Pirez and the others who were with him took the other Moors.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo Gomez Pirez pursued his voyage, as you have heard he had said to the\r\nothers after they reached the village; and when he was now distant a\r\ngood space from the place where they had made their booty, he caught\r\nsight of a Moor coming on an ass; and it appeareth that he had left the\r\nspot where the other Moors remained. But as soon as the Moor caught\r\nsight of our men he threw himself from his ass and began to turn back,\r\nrunning to where he had left his companions. And since the land was\r\nlevel, and the Moor was fresh, and had sight of our men coming a long\r\nway off; because of all this the Christians could not follow him, being\r\ngreatly wearied from the toil and loss of sleep they had now had for two\r\ndays. But they kept him in sight as long as they were able, and at the\r\nend they were obliged to lose him, yet they failed not to keep a\r\nstraight course until they reached the huts of a village, where it\r\nseemeth the other Moors were, and in it they found no one; and this\r\nwould be about the hour of terce. And as they were gazing around the\r\nmoorland as far as their eyes could reach, they perceived the Moors who\r\nhad set out from thence; and tired as they were, they followed after\r\nthem by the space of a league and a half, when they came upon them by\r\nthe sea, near which they had retreated to some very great rocks;[N214]\r\nand our men laboured to seek them out, but many as they were, yet on\r\naccount of the difficulty of the place, they could not capture more than\r\nseven. And so they persevered in this toil all that day until nearly\r\nnightfall, but over and above their weariness, they sorely felt hunger\r\nand thirst, for which they had no remedy. And when they had searched all\r\nthe places they deemed likely for anyone to hide in, they agreed to turn\r\nback. And true it is that some declared it would be well for some of\r\nthem to remain there that night, to see if those Moors would come out,\r\nwho were lying hid, but there was no one who dared to remain, so weakly\r\ndid they feel their bodies to be; but rather they determined one and all\r\nto turn back to their caravels. And it seemeth that it pleased our Lord\r\nGod to have a mind to their weakness, for He ordained that they should\r\nmeet upon that path, by the which they were going, two camels already\r\nsaddled. And this was a great help to their repose, for they took it in\r\nturn to ride them until they came to their ships, where they found they\r\nhad a booty of nine-and-seventy souls.\r\n\r\nOn the next day it was agreed among them that inasmuch as their ships\r\nwere not able to lodge so many Moors on account of the salt they were\r\ncarrying from this realm--and this was in order to salt the skins of the\r\nsea-calves lest they should have no other booty, or perchance it was to\r\nenter into ransoming with the Moors--therefore they should throw all\r\nthat salt overboard, as in fact they did. And they were minded still to\r\ndepart and run down that other coast, and on account of a storm that\r\ncame upon them, they determined there to caulk their ships that they\r\nmight the better encounter the fortunes of the sea as they returned. And\r\nwhen their ships had finished their repairing, Gomez Pirez took aside\r\none of those Moors to know where there might be any other Moors that he\r\ncould capture; but although the Moor told him where lay certain villages\r\nand they went to them, directing their course toward the south, they\r\nfound neither Moor nor Mooress in them nor any other creature. And so\r\nthey made their way by certain places where the Moor thought they would\r\nfind them, until they were right well assured that the Moors had\r\nknowledge of them, and that it would be lost labour for them to go\r\nfurther in their search. Wherefore they agreed to turn back to the\r\nKingdom, seeing that their food was failing them, and especially their\r\nwater, of which they could have no fresh supply in that land. And so\r\nthey directed their voyage until they returned to Lagos, on the borders\r\nof which the Infant was staying at a place that is called Mexilhueira.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCIII.\r\n\r\nOf the caravel that went to Meça, and of the Moors that it found.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following year, which was 1447 from the birth of Christ, the\r\nInfant considering that the Moors would not enter into trafficking at\r\nthe Rio do Ouro, and that even though they had been minded to do it\r\naforetime, yet now their good will would be altogether lacking on\r\naccount of the Moors who had been captured by Gomez Pirez, as you have\r\nheard at length, wished to make trial if perchance the matter might\r\nbetter be accomplished by trafficking at that place which is called\r\nMeça.[N215] And that he might also obtain a better knowledge of that\r\nland, he straightway ordered them to make ready a caravel of an esquire\r\nof his called Diego Gil, the which was a man who had right well served\r\nhim in the wars of the Moors both by land and by sea. And after he had\r\ntaken order for these things, he had tidings that a merchant of Castile,\r\nnamed Marcos Cisfontes, was possessed of twenty-six Moors, from that\r\nplace, who were already ransomed in exchange for certain Guineas. And in\r\norder that his ship might have some cargo on its outward voyage, he let\r\nthe said merchant know that, if it pleased him, his Moors should be\r\ntransported to that place in the caravel which he had made ready, if\r\nonly he would give him a certain part of his profits in the said ransom.\r\nAnd to say truth, it was not so much the hope of gain from those men, as\r\nfor two other reasons, that the Infant was content to do this--in the\r\nfirst place that he might have a better opportunity of seeing the land\r\nand knowing in what manner they would enter into the traffic of\r\nmerchandise; and in the second place, that he might bring from thence\r\nthose Guineas,[N216] for he believed they would receive the faith of\r\nChrist. That merchant was right well pleased with the terms the Infant\r\nsent to offer him, and so the caravel was immediately got ready and the\r\ncargo embarked, and the ship made its voyage straight to Meça, where\r\nthey talked much about the trafficking, but could not bring anything to\r\nan agreement. Wherefore John Fernandez, that esquire who had remained\r\nfor those seven months among the Moors of the Sahara, as you have\r\nalready heard, spake to Diego Gil and to Rodrigueannes, another esquire\r\nwhom the Infant was sending there to carry out the trafficking, and also\r\nto a Castilian merchant who was there to ransom the Moors. And he said:\r\n\"If you are willing, I will go on land to arrange this ransom.\" And\r\ntaking his sureties, he went amongst them, and bargained in such wise\r\nthat he had fifty-one Guineas brought to the caravel, in exchange for\r\nwhom eighteen Moors[N217] were given. And then it came to pass that the\r\nwind arose with such force from the side of the South that he was\r\nobliged to raise sail and return to the Kingdom. Then there was brought\r\nto the Infant a lion, which he afterwards sent to a place in Ireland\r\nwhich is called Galway, to a servitor of his who dwelt in that land, for\r\nthey knew that never had such a beast been seen in that part. And so\r\nJohn Fernandez remained until another ship returned for him. And in this\r\nsame year Antam Gonçalvez returned to the Rio do Ouro to see if he could\r\npersuade the Moors to come to traffick, but his going there turned out\r\nto be very dangerous. For as he was lying on his anchors up the river,\r\nthe Moors straightway came down to the beach. And among them was one who\r\nclearly showed that he held lordship over them, and of him Antam\r\nGonçalvez received sureties; but he warned him that he was not to trust\r\nthe others except when he himself was present. And it was so, that when\r\nthat Moor was distant from there, because the other Moors showed signs\r\nof confidence to the Christians, Antam Gonçalvez willed to go on land,\r\nthinking moreover that the Moor who had given him security would be\r\nthere. And as soon as he came near the shore, and saw not that captain\r\nor lord of the enemy, he would not land. But as he could not well speak\r\nwith them, being at a distance, he had the boat pulled very near the\r\nbeach, and there the foemen clearly discovered the hidden guile that was\r\nin them, for they hurled their assegais like men who would fain display\r\nthe mortal enmity they felt for our people. And had it not been for the\r\ngreat hardihood of Antam Gonçalvez, he had there met his end in a brief\r\nspace with all his company. But as it was, he had the boat rowed off\r\nvery lustily, though this could not be accomplished except with much\r\nlabour, for the multitude of assegais that fell upon them. But it\r\npleased God that they escaped out of that place and left some of those\r\nMoors wounded; and of the Christians one was wounded in such wise that\r\nwithin a few days he made his end, whenas the ship was already at sea.\r\n\r\nAnd in this same year there went another caravel of a servitor of the\r\nInfant, whose name was George Gonçalvez, in which voyaged the said\r\nGonçalvez and another; and they brought back from the Rio do Ouro much\r\noil and many skins of sea-calves. And in this chapter the affairs of\r\nthis year come to an end, for we find no other deeds in it that are\r\nworthy of being recounted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCIV.\r\n\r\nHow Vallarte went to the land of Guinea, and the fashion of his\r\nremaining there.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fame of the affair having spread through the different parts of the\r\nworld, it arrived at the Court of the King of Denmark and Sweden and\r\nNorway;[N218] and as you see how noble men venture themselves with the\r\ndesire to see and know such things, it came to pass that a gentleman of\r\nthe household of that Prince, covetous of seeing the world, received his\r\nlicense and came to this realm. And staying for a time in the house of\r\nthe Infant, he came one day and asked him that he would be pleased to\r\narm him a caravel and put him in the way to go to the land of the\r\nNegroes. The Infant, as he was easily moved to anything wherein a good\r\nman might gain for himself honour or increase, straightway ordered a\r\ncaravel to be armed as completely as might be, and told him to go to\r\nCape Verde and see if they could obtain sureties from the King of that\r\nland, for he was informed that this man was a very great lord; and he\r\nwas to convey the Prince's letters to him and also to tell him certain\r\nthings from himself for the service of God and His holy faith. And all\r\nthis because they assured him the said King was a Christian; and the\r\nconclusion of all was, that if he did truly hold the law of Christ, it\r\nwould please him to aid in the war against the Moors of Africa, in the\r\nwhich the King Don Affonso, who then reigned in Portugal, and the Infant\r\nin his name, with the others their vassals and countrymen, were\r\ncontinually toiling. All things were very quickly ready, and that\r\nesquire, who was named Vallarte, embarked in his ship, and with him a\r\nKnight of the Order of Christ called Fernandaffonso, who was of the\r\nInfant's service and upbringing, and was sent by him in that caravel\r\nbecause Vallarte was a foreigner and knew not so well the customs and\r\nways of the ship's company. And he came in order that he might direct\r\nthe sailors and other matters that pertained to the governance of the\r\nvessel, and also that he might be as it were an envoy, if they chanced\r\nto see that King. And therefore he took two natives of that land as\r\ninterpreters; but the chief captaincy belonged to Vallarte. And after\r\nenduring great toils on the sea, they made such a voyage that six months\r\nafter the day that they first left Lisbon, they reached the Island of\r\nPalma that is in the land of the Negroes near Cape Verde. And there they\r\ntook counsel about the manner in which they should henceforth act,\r\naccording to the regulations they carried with them from the Infant; and\r\nthen they sailed forward because that was not yet the port where they\r\nhad to rest. And when they were at the extremity of the cape, in a place\r\nwhich among the natives of that land is called Abram, they had their\r\nboat put out and went on shore, and Vallarte went in it with some others\r\nand they found many of those Negroes already there. And Vallarte asked\r\nthem to give him one of their people and he would give them one of his,\r\nso that there might be security between them and they could have their\r\nparleying; but they made reply that such a thing they could not do\r\nwithout the leave of a knight who lived there as a governor of that\r\nland, whose name was Guitanye. And he, as soon as he knew of this\r\nrequirement, came there and was well pleased to grant what Vallarte\r\nasked. And as soon as one of these Negroes had reached the caravel,\r\nFernandaffonso, who knew our Portuguese language best, began to speak\r\nwith him, saying as follows: \"The reason why we required of you to come\r\nto this ship was that you might tell your lord, by our authority, how we\r\nare the subjects of a great and powerful Prince of Spain, who is at the\r\nlimits of the west, and by whose command we have come here to converse\r\non his behalf with the great and good King of this land.\" And they\r\ncaused him to read one of the letters they were carrying, the which was\r\ndeclared to him by one of their interpreters, so that he might repeat it\r\nto that knight who had sent him there. \"How much soever,\" quoth he, \"you\r\ndesire to see Boor, who is our great King, you cannot for the present\r\nhave a message from him, for it is certain that he is very distant from\r\nhere, busied in making war upon another great lord who willeth not to\r\nobey him.\" \"And if he were still in his house,\" said Fernandaffonso, \"in\r\nhow many days could they go to him with our message and also return with\r\nthe reply?\" \"From six to seven days would be the greatest delay,\"\r\nreplied the Guinea. \"Then,\" said Fernandaffonso, \"it would be well for\r\nyou to tell this knight with whom you live to send a man there with the\r\nmessage, and to let him know all that I have already told you, and if\r\nyour lord will do after this wise he will render a great service to his\r\nking and bring much profit to his land.\" \"Now,\" said the Guinea, \"I will\r\ntell all very truly to Guitanye.\"\r\n\r\nThen they presented him with victuals, of the which he ate and drank,\r\nand afterward gave him one of the letters they brought, for him to show\r\nit to his lord; and this, he was to say, contained what they had told\r\nhim, and he was to bear it as a token of friendship. But already when\r\nthat Guinea reached the land, where was the knight who had despatched\r\nhim, another like unto him was there named Satam, and another known as\r\nMinef, who had arrived there a little time before. And of this last the\r\nfoulness was extreme, and those who were there said that nothing more\r\nfoul could be painted, and his apparel was no great testimony to his\r\nhonour, for he appeared there very ill-clad, although he had a greater\r\npower than some of the others. And whilst that Guinea was telling the\r\nknight of his embassy, the boat lay near the beach waiting for a reply,\r\nthe which was very difficile to come at because the Guineas crowded\r\nround the man who came from the caravel, with a mind to know what he\r\nsaid, and also with desire to see the letter he bore, so that the\r\nknights were put to great trouble to remove them from there for a space.\r\nAnd in the end they could get no reply in all that day, although the\r\nknight went far into the water to speak with those in the boat, for such\r\nwas the multitude of Guineas that they would never let him finish, and\r\nso all was left over for the next day, on which the boat went ashore\r\nvery early. But the knight was already there in a canoe wherewith he\r\nwould have journeyed to the caravel, but when he saw the boat coming he\r\nreturned ashore. And he had a she-goat brought, and a kid, and paste,\r\nand boiled flour with butter, and bread with meal, and corn in the ear,\r\nand an elephant's tooth, and some seed of which that bread was made, and\r\nmilk, and palm wine. And there happened to be there a knight who had\r\narrived that same night, called Amallam, and he was the son of an uncle\r\nof that Guitanye by whose favour he had received that land, and it\r\nseemeth he would fain have spoken with those in the boat, but the Guinea\r\nwould not allow him, saying that it was not right, as he had commenced\r\nthe matter. And on this account he advised our men to return and take\r\naway those things for their refreshment, and after they had eaten to\r\ncome back; and in the meanwhile they would hold their council. But if\r\nbefore this they were divided in mind through their conversing, they\r\nwere much more so in the afternoon; and because we should have to be\r\nvery prolix were we to recount minutely all that passed between one and\r\nthe other in their parleying, let it suffice to say that this knight\r\nGuitanye went several times to the caravel, making the journey in a\r\ncanoe and taking four men with him. And he talked with our men\r\nconcerning the traffic, and said that he was able to set everything in\r\norder, because that, when King Boor bestowed land on a knight, the\r\nlatter could do therewith like the king himself, so that whatever he\r\ndid, the king held it as well done. Howbeit, our men said that they\r\ncarried orders to do nothing until they should have first spoken to that\r\nking, and upon this matter there passed much reasoning; and the end was\r\nthat he should nevertheless send to the house of the king with their\r\nmessage. And whilst they were tarrying for the messenger who was there,\r\nthat Guitanye went to the ship in all security, taking with him of the\r\nbest viands that he had, with elephant's teeth, and certain other\r\nthings, and he also received drink-money, and cloth, with other precious\r\narticles that our men gave him, and he showed himself to be very content\r\nwith their converse. And one day they came to ask him that he would have\r\nan elephant killed for them, to strip off its skin, and teeth, and\r\nbones, with some part of the flesh, to which the Guinea replied that\r\nthis could be accomplished without great toil. \"Then,\" said Vallarte,\r\n\"if you will put us in the way to this, for each one of us two that\r\nreturneth here, you shall have a tent of linen cloth, in the which from\r\ntwenty-five to thirty men can lodge, and so light that one can carry it\r\non his neck.\" And our men went many times to the land with him and were\r\nat his call, but not so near that they could capture them. And it\r\nhappened once on a time that the boat was near to the shore and with the\r\nrush of the sea it touched on the dry land, whereupon those in it were\r\nmuch affrighted; and when the knight perceived it, he told them to be of\r\ngood courage, for all those were his men, and they would do them no\r\ndispleasure; and so in everything that Guinea knight showed himself to\r\nbe a true man. But Fortune, aided at times by the ill counsel of some,\r\nordained matters in such wise that our men had not so agreeable an end\r\nto this commencement. For it was so, that whilst that Guitanye was in\r\nsearch of the elephant as he had promised, Vallarte, like a man of\r\nlittle discretion, would go on shore one day, for it seemeth that for\r\nsome time they had called him. And true it is that he was told\r\nbeforehand that he should abstain from going, yet he must needs land, as\r\na man summoned by Fortune to witness the hour of his great trouble. And\r\nas he was near the shore, there appeared a Negro carrying a gourd with\r\nwine or water, and pretending that he was desirous to give it him; and\r\nVallarte bade those who were rowing to draw near; and although some said\r\nto him that such an approach was unwise, yet they had to obey his\r\norders, to the great injury of all. For as the boat was being taken into\r\nshore they went so near the land, to take the said gourd from the negro,\r\nthat it touched ground. And whilst Vallarte was looking at a multitude\r\nof those Negroes who were lying under the shade of a tree, one of the\r\ninterpreters they carried, called Affonso, made as though he would take\r\nthe gourd and let himself slip out. And when the others perceived this\r\nand tried to bring the boat back, there came upon them a wave and\r\noverturned it altogether; and then the Negroes hastened up very lustily\r\nand fell in a body on the boat, hurling their assegais. So that of all\r\nthe number who set out from the caravel in that journey, there returned\r\nnot to the ship more than one, who threw himself into the water and\r\nswam; but we find not what end the others had, inasmuch as that man who\r\ncame away by swimming said that he only saw one slain, and that when he\r\nlooked behind him, yea, three or four times, he always saw Vallarte\r\nseated on the poop of the boat. But at the time when we were writing\r\nthis history, there came into the Infant's power some captives who were\r\nnatives of that part, and they said that in a castle very far inland\r\nwere four Christians, of whom one was dead already, but the other three\r\nwere still living, and some held that these would be the lost men,\r\naccording to the tokens that the Negro gave. And Fernandaffonso,\r\nconsidering this untoward event, and also that he had no boat wherewith\r\nhe could return on shore to gain news of the others, had his anchors\r\nraised and returned to the Kingdom.[N219]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCV.\r\n\r\nHow Antam Gonçalvez went and received the Island of Lançarote in the\r\nInfant's name.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf so well tried a usance in that land of the Moors were now the\r\ndwellers in Lagos, that not only were they content to go there and make\r\nwar on the inhabitants, but there were some even who, not satiate with\r\nfishing in the accustomed places of their fathers and grand-fathers,\r\nessayed to go and fish in the seas of that coast. And they sought\r\nlicense of the Infant and promised him a certain sum for it, that he\r\nwould let them pass there and set in order their fishery. And I believe\r\nthat this was not required in vain, for it may well be conceived that\r\nsome of those who had gone there before had perceived the sea to be so\r\nreplete with fish that they were moved to make such a request. Wherefore\r\nhaving arranged with the Infant for a certain quantity of money which\r\nthey had to give him for the right which belonged to him there, they\r\ndirected their expedition, sailing on their course until they reached a\r\nplace called the Cabo dos Ruyvos.[N220] And here they began to set in\r\norder their fishery, and of the fish they found a very great abundance.\r\nAnd when they had been there for some days and already had a good part\r\nof their fish dried, and another portion set upon poles to dry it, the\r\nMoors came upon them, very wroth at such daring, and they almost killed\r\nthe fishermen, and this in fact they would have done if it had not been\r\nfor their good diligence in retreating. So that in the end they turned\r\nall their anger upon the fish that was spread out to dry, and this they\r\ncut in pieces with their arms with no less anger than they would have\r\ndone to their foemen if they could have reached them. And two of those\r\nfishermen were wounded in that retirement, though not with dangerous\r\nwounds, but only with such that they were healed of them in a very brief\r\nspace. And they turned back to their native town, not repenting them of\r\ntheir voyage, for they brought with them sufficient gain in the fish\r\nthat they had already dried and packed in their ship in precaution\r\nagainst the fortune that afterwards happened to them. And in this year\r\nthe Infant, who was desirous to follow up much further his first design,\r\nseeing that for matters to come to better perfection he needed one of\r\nthe Islands of Canary, contracted with that Monsieur Maciot, of whom we\r\nhave already spoken, who had the lordship of the Island of Lançarote, to\r\ngive it up to him. And he, satisfied by a present or fixed rent for\r\nevery year, gave up the said Island with all its seigniory to the\r\nInfant, and the latter made chief captain thereof that noble knight\r\nAntam Gonçalvez, first of all; and he went and took possession of the\r\nsaid Island in his name, and remained therein some time animating its\r\ninhabitants to the service and obedience of his lord with such benignity\r\nand sweetness that in a very brief space his virtue was confessed of\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCVI.\r\n\r\nWherein the Author declareth how many souls were brought to this Kingdom\r\nfrom the beginning of this Conquest.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of this book I assigned five reasons by which our\r\nhigh-souled Prince was moved to send his ships so often in the toil of\r\nthis Conquest, and because me seemeth I have given you a plentiful\r\nunderstanding of the first four in the chapters wherein I spake of the\r\ndifferent parts into which those Eastern lands may be divided, it\r\nremaineth for me to tell of the fifth reason, and to fix the certain\r\nnumber of the souls of infidels who have come from those lands to this,\r\nthrough the virtue and talents of our glorious Prince. And I counted\r\nthese souls and found they were nine hundred twenty and seven, of whom,\r\nas I have said before, the greater part were turned into the true path\r\nof salvation.[N221] See now how numerous would be the generation that\r\ncould issue from these, and what taking of a city or of a town could\r\nyield greater honour than that of which I have spoken up to now; for\r\nleaving out these first and those who have descended, and until the end\r\nof the world may descend, from them, many more came afterwards, as in\r\nthe following book you will learn. For it was needful that we should\r\nhere make an end at the deeds of this year 1448 from the birth of\r\nChrist; because at this time the King Don Affonso of Portugal, 5th of\r\nthat name and 12th in the number of Kings, had the entire rule of his\r\nkingdoms, being then of the age of 17 years, and married to the very\r\nvirtuous and illustrious princess, the Queen Donna Isabel, who was\r\ndaughter to the Infant Don Pedro, Duke of Coimbra and Lord of Montemor,\r\nthe same that in the past years had governed the Kingdom in the King's\r\nname, as in some parts of this history we have recorded, and as you will\r\nfind much more perfectly in the general Chronicle of the Kingdom. So\r\nconsidering how that all other things, as it were, became new with the\r\nnew ruler, it appeared to us fitting that all books of his acts and\r\nhistories should here commence. And, moreover, as it seemeth to us that\r\nthe volume we have already written is of reasonable size, we have here\r\nmade an end, intending, as hath been said, to make another book that\r\nshall reach to the end of the Infant's deeds, although the matters that\r\nfollow were not accomplished with such toil and bravery as in the past.\r\nFor after this year, the affairs of these parts were henceforth treated\r\nmore by trafficking and bargaining of merchants than by bravery and toil\r\nin arms.[N222]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCVII.\r\n\r\nIn which the Author putteth a final conclusion to his work.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery work to be perfect requireth to be placed in the ternary number,\r\nthat is to say, it must have a beginning, a middle, and an end; and for\r\nthe more perfect understanding of this, it is well we should know that\r\nthere are three ternaries in the General Universal of the world, and the\r\nfirst of these we call \"super-excellent,\" and we can find no certain\r\nname to signify its perfection to us, for it is unknown of sensuality,\r\nand common natures cannot understand it; but an obedient faith, with\r\ngreat humility, rendered more lively by the grace of God, placeth in it\r\na steadfast strength. And therefore that philosopher and theologian,\r\nAlbert the Great,[N223] in the 1st chapter of the _Celestial Hierarchy_,\r\ngiveth three degrees of understanding by which God may be known.\r\n\r\nAnd the first he compareth to the birds that fly by night, such as bats,\r\nowls, and other such, whose sight can in no way endure the sun's\r\nbrightness; which also the prince of philosophers affirmeth in his\r\n_Metaphysics_, saying that our understanding is such (compared to the\r\nthings that in their essence, as far as Nature runneth, are manifest) as\r\nthe eye of the owl or bat in comparison with the brightness of the Sun.\r\nFor such a vision have those who involve themselves in the desires of\r\nthe earth, placing all their affection in what they receive from the\r\nimages that are felt, and by this obstruct their understanding, so that\r\nit knoweth nothing of the Divine Being. And in the second he maketh\r\ncomparison of the other birds that have a stronger sense and endure the\r\nheat of the Sun, but when they regard its splendour their eyes do\r\nconstantly tremble; and in this manner do some act, who, withdrawing\r\nthemselves far from external objects follow after Speculation by\r\nUnderstanding, and removing their minds far from Materiality see the\r\nDeity from afar with trembling; but as they desire to understand with\r\nhuman reason, it faileth them frequently and they fall into error, even\r\nas fell a part of the great philosophers who were not illumined by the\r\nlight of Faith. The third vision is possessed by the beauteous eagles,\r\nwhich can gaze with the organ of vision upon the resplendent orb of this\r\nPlanet, and by these we may principally understand those that read in\r\nthe book of life and know all things as far as their understanding\r\nextendeth without other investigation. And so the men, who in the\r\nknowledge of God wish to obtain entire strength, subdue themselves to\r\nthe Holy Gospel, and taking solace from what they understand, adore with\r\nhumble and great reverence that which by subtlety they cannot embrace,\r\nand faithfully confess with the Doctor Saint Thomas in the ninth article\r\nof the 10th question of the book called _De Potentia Dei_, that in God\r\nthere is one real circle wholly enclosed in a perfect ternary, because\r\nHe comprehendeth Himself and speaketh and begetteth an Eternal Word in\r\nwhich He vieweth Himself and all things. And from the Father and Son\r\nthere is breathed forth a tender issue by which the Divine essence is\r\nbeloved and all that proceedeth from it. And so where was the\r\nCommencement of Understanding, there the Loving Will maketh its End. And\r\nwe have an example of this in ourselves; for, if we consider what we\r\nunderstand, a certain knowledge is generated in the soul, and then the\r\nunderstanding offereth to the will that it may freely take what pleaseth\r\nit most; and it, receptive of the tender object, inclineth by affection\r\nto that by which the understanding was first moved.\r\n\r\nIn this manner is finished the circle which is super-spiritual and\r\ninfinite in height, and in itself cannot proceed beyond the ternary in\r\nwhich it endeth. The second circular ternary is that of nature which\r\nincludeth in it all the creatures, and it may be imagined in this wise:\r\nlet us take some fountain that never faileth, from which a certain river\r\ntaketh its birth, and following its course according to the vigour that\r\nit received in the commencement, it returneth to that fount at last from\r\nwhich it originally proceeded. And so all things have their commencement\r\nin the Lord God, the general cause and continuing in the Life they\r\nreceive from Him, they have their last end in that from which they had\r\ntheir first beginning.\r\n\r\nAnd by this ternary (which is in them of beginning, middle, and final\r\nend), saith the Philosopher, in the book that he made in which he\r\ndiscoursed of the Heaven and the World, that the ternary is the number\r\nin everything, and that it encloseth in itself the like perfection and\r\nmiddle and certain end, and that from it no creature is exempt. And on\r\nthis account it was anciently established that God should be praised as\r\na ternary.\r\n\r\nThe third ternary circle we call Moral, and it belongeth to the works\r\nthat are done by us, the which commence in the credit that the Lord God\r\nwilleth to give them, for He doeth them chiefly, and we are instruments\r\nset in the midst, which He useth at His pleasure, working His will and\r\naccomplishing them as He pleaseth; and for the confirming of this it is\r\nwritten in the Gospel of St. Luke that if we do all that is commanded of\r\nus, we may know that we are unprofitable servants, for we only perform\r\nthat to which we are constrained. And of a certainty all that we can do\r\nis vanity, since it can be accomplished without us, and we deserve\r\nnothing in it except as far as it pleaseth the Creator to grant us of\r\nHis mercy, by doing us the excellent favour of making use of us in His\r\nactions, and willing that we be instruments in some of the things that\r\nHe doeth. And this pleaseth His goodness, because He findeth in us some\r\nwork of His by which we may earn a good reward. And therefore wise men\r\nperceiving this infinite mercy, that maketh them to be what they are,\r\nand understanding that all good works proceed from Him by His imperial\r\npleasure, confess that they deserve nothing for what they may do; and\r\nthey labour to fulfil this circle, so that their every act may terminate\r\nin that beginning where it commenced.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAnd because you, most high and excellent Prince, among mortals, and\r\naccording to my thinking, most virtuous lord, chiefly for the sake of\r\nthanksgiving didst order me, Gomez Eannes de Azurara, your servant and\r\ncreature, and through your munificence, Knight and Commander in the\r\nOrder of Christ, to compose this book, with good reason it seemeth fit\r\nthat in thanksgiving I should make an end of it. And since the Apostle\r\nSaint Paul teacheth us in all things to give thanks to God, as is\r\ncontained in the Epistle which he sent to the men of Thessalonica; so,\r\nmaking the circle of my work, I put the final term in that Helper who\r\nwas invoked by my will in the commencement; and I offer to the Infinite\r\nPersonal Ternary whatsoever thanks I can, for I have not the power to\r\ngive as many as I owe: firstly, to the Father super-essential, from whom\r\nuniversally proceed all things, to Him I give thanks for the talent he\r\ngave me to commence this work; and then to the Son super-spiritual, who\r\nhad no commencement of being, to Him I give thanks for the help He\r\nbestowed on me to continue what I had commenced; and then to the Holy\r\nSpirit super-natural, from whom we have all good things by His\r\nbenevolence, to Him I give thanks for the inspiration by which He moved\r\nyour Highness to lay this command upon me and not on any other of your\r\ncountrymen and subjects, of whom you could have had many. And jointly to\r\nall the Three Persons who compose the Ineffable Trinity and\r\nSuper-essential Unity, our one only true Lord God, I offer thanks for\r\nthe ending, because all things have concluded better than I thought\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAnd this work was finished in the Library that this King Don Affonso\r\nmade in Lisbon, on the 18th day of February, being written in this first\r\nvolume by John Gonçalvez, Esquire and Scrivener of the books of the said\r\nLord King. And to this lord may the most infinite, benign, and merciful\r\nGod ever grant increase of good works and virtues better and better all\r\nthe days and years of his life, and give him the fruit of His blessing\r\nthat he may ever render Him thanks and praise, because He is his Maker\r\nand Creator. In the year of Jesus Christ 1453.\r\n\r\n          DEO GRACIAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\n[_N.B.--The page references are to the Hakluyt Society's translation_].\r\n\r\n[Endnote 1: (p. 2). _St. Thomas, who was the most clear teacher among\r\nthe Doctors of Theology_, i.e., St. Thomas Aquinas, greatest of the\r\nSchoolmen (\"Doctor Angelicus\"); born at Rocca Secca, near Aquino, 1225\r\n(according to some 1227); Professor of Theology at Cologne 1248, at\r\nParis 1253 and 1269, at Rome 1261, etc., at Naples 1272 (Doctor of\r\nTheology, 1257).

Γαράμαντεσ ...\r\nἔθνοσ μέγα ἰσχυρῶσ [Garamantes ... ethnos mega ischyrôs] says\r\nHerodotus (iv, 183). Yet like the Nasamones and other nations of this\r\npart, they are apparently conceived of by H. as a people confined to a\r\nsingle oasis of the desert. The Garamantes' land, H. adds, is thirty\r\ndays' journey from the Lotos Eaters on the North coast of Africa, which\r\nis about the true distance from Mourzuk, in Fezzan, to Tripoli (see the\r\njourneys of Captain Lyon in 1820, and of Colonel Monteil in 1892). The\r\noasis, ten days' journey beyond the Garamantes, inhabited by the\r\nAtarantes or Atlantes, may be the Herodotean conception of Tibesti.\r\n\r\nCompare the story, in Herodotus, ii, 32, 33, of five Nasamonians, from\r\nthe shore of the Great Syrtes, crossing the deserts to the south of\r\nLibya to an inhabited region, far west of their home, with fruit trees,\r\nextensive marshes, a city inhabited by Black People of small stature, a\r\nriver flowing from west to east containing crocodiles: probably either\r\nthe modern Bornu or one of the Negro states on the Middle Niger.\r\n\r\nPliny (_Hist Nat._, v, 5, §36) records the conquest of the Garamantes by\r\nCornelius Balbus in B.C. 20, when the Romans captured Cydamus (Ghadames\r\nin south-west Tripoli) and Garama (\"clarissimum oppidum,\" the Germa of\r\nthe present day, whence the name \"Garamantes\").\r\n\r\nIn the time of Vespasian the more direct route from Œa or Tripoli to\r\nPhazania was discovered (Pliny, _l. c._). In the reign of Tiberius,\r\nduring the revolt of Tacfarinas in Numidia, the Garamantes supported the\r\nrebel, and after his defeat sent to Rome to sue for pardon, an unusual\r\nembassy, as Tacitus remarks (\"Garamantum legati, raro in urbe visi\").\r\nFrom Fezzan, in later days (about time of Trajan?) started the\r\nremarkable expeditions of Septimius Flaccus and Julius Maternus to the\r\n\"Ethiopian land\" (Sudan) and Agisymba (Region of Lake Chad?) in the\r\nsouth, which reached inhabited country after a march of three and four\r\nmonths respectively across the desert (see Ptolemy, i, 8, §5, from\r\nMarinus of Tyre, now lost except in Pt.'s citations). The original\r\nconquest by Balbus is probably referred to in Virgil's _Æneid VI_, 795,\r\nin the prophecy of Augustus' triumphs:--\r\n\r\n  \"Super et Garamantes et Indos Proferet imperium.\"\r\n\r\n_The Ethiopians ... under the Shadow of Mount Caucasus_ is an extreme\r\ninstance of the mediæval geography met with so frequently in Azurara, as\r\nno African \"Mt.

III, chs. i, xxxviii-xxxix.\r\nMost commonly, Greater India means India west of Ganges; Lesser India\r\ncorresponds to the classical _India extra Gangem_, or Assam, Burma,\r\nSiam, etc.; and Middle India stands for Abyssinia, and perhaps for some\r\nparts of the Arabian coast, as far as the Persian Gulf. On this passage\r\nwe must also notice the following MS. notes:--\r\n\r\n[α. _Garamantes, Ethiopians and Indians._--It must be understood that\r\nthese are three peoples, as saith Isidore in his sixth book [_i.e._, _of\r\nthe Etymologies_ or _Origins of St. Isidore of Seville_, _written c.\r\nA.D. 600_], to wit, the Asperi, Garamantes and Indians. The Asperi are\r\nin the west, the Garamantes in the middle, the Indians in the east.

Alfargano [_Mohammed\r\nAlfergani, or of Ferghanah on the Upper Oxus, a great Mohammedan\r\ngeographer of the ninth century, author of a \"Book of Celestial\r\nMovements\" translated into Hebrew and from Hebrew into Latin, which also\r\ndescribed the chief towns and countries of the world_] placed Meroe,\r\nwhich is Queen of the Nations, between the Nubians and the Indians.

Ethiopia is over against Egypt and\r\nAfrica, on the southern part thereof; from the east it stretcheth over\r\nagainst the west even to the Ethiopian Sea. And because much of the\r\npeople of these three nations are Christians, and because they desired\r\nto see the world, they came to these parts of Spain, where they received\r\ngreat gifts from the Infant, on account of which the author hath given\r\nthis description in his chapter thereupon.\r\n\r\nβ. _Caucasus._--This mount is so called from Candor, the which\r\nstretcheth from India to Taurus, in its length, through various peoples\r\nand tongues, and therefore is variously named.

The town is built\r\nround the Cathedral, which claims to possess the body of St. James. A\r\nstar was said to have originally shown the place of this relic, hence\r\n\"Compostella\" (Campus stellae). The body of the great church was\r\ncommenced in 1082 and completed in 1128; the cloisters were finished in\r\n1533. An earlier church of the later ninth century had been destroyed in\r\n997 by the Arabs under the famous \"hagib\" Almanzor, who also restored\r\nBarcelona to the Western Caliphate, and nearly crushed all the Christian\r\nkingdoms of Spain. For centuries Compostella was the most famous and\r\nfashionable place of pilgrimage, next to Rome, in Europe.

And\r\nthis was one of the places which were given to Jacob, by the countenance\r\nof his son Joseph, when by the needs of hunger he went with his eleven\r\nsons to Egypt, as it is writ in Genesis. And Saint Isidore saith in his\r\nxvth book (_of Origins_) that Cadmus built Thebes in Egypt, and that he,\r\npassing into Greece, founded the other and Grecian Thebes, in the\r\nprovince of Acaya (_Achaia_), the which is now called the land of the\r\nPrince of the Amoreans.]\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to dwell on the additional confusion furnished by\r\nthis \"explanation\"--Thebes given to the Israelites (as part of Goshen?),\r\nCadmus building the Egyptian Thebes, Achaia for Bœotia, and so forth;\r\nbut the point really noticeable is that in Azurara's text the \"dwellers\r\non the Nile who possess Thebes\" came in here as \"wearing the Prince's\r\nlivery:\" _i.e._, the negroes of the Senegal are supposed to live on the\r\nwestern branch of the Nile, which mediæval conceptions obstinately\r\nbrought from Egypt or Nubia to the Atlantic, and which Prince Henry's\r\nseamen thought they had discovered when they reached the Senegal; just\r\nas later in the Gambia, the Niger, and the Congo, other equivalents were\r\nimagined for the Negro Nile of Edrisi, and the West African\r\nriver-courses of Pliny and Ptolemy.

[Labyrinth is so much as to say anything\r\ninto which a man having entered cannot go out again (_so Prince Henry,\r\nin Azurara, vol. i, p. 8 (ch. ii), has \"entered a labyrinth of Glory\"_).\r\nAnd therefore, saith Ovid, in his _Metamorphoses_, that Pasiphaë, wife\r\nof Minos, king of Crete, conceived the Minotaur, who was half man and\r\nhalf bull. The which was imprisoned by Daedalus in the Labyrinth into\r\nwhich whatsoever entered knew not how to come out, and whosoever was\r\nwithout knew not how to enter. And of this Labyrinth speaketh Seneca in\r\nthe _Tragedy_, where he treated of the matter of Hippolytus and Phedra].\r\n\r\nAzurara's reference to the distinctive virtues of the four great peoples\r\nhere noticed is interesting, especially from the fact that Prince\r\nHenry's mother was an Englishwoman; that the Emperor (now a purely\r\nGerman sovereign, though still in name \"holy and Roman\"), invited him to\r\nenter his service (see ch. vi); that the Pope (like Henry VI (?) King of\r\nEngland) made him similar offers; that his scientific and practical\r\nconnections with Italy were very important; and that his sister Isabel\r\nwas married to the Duke of Burgundy. \"The wisdom of the Italians\" was\r\nnowhere more conspicuous at that time than in geography. Italians\r\ninitiated the great mediæval and renaissance movement of discovery both\r\nby land and sea (cf. John de Plano Carpini, Marco, Nicolo, and Matteo\r\nPolo, Malocello, Tedisio Dorio, the Vivaldi, the Genoese captains and\r\npilots of 1341, precursors of Varthema, the Cabots, Verrazano, and\r\nColumbus). Italians also constructed the first scientific maps or\r\nPortolani (existing specimens from 1300 show out of 498 examples 413 of\r\nItalian origin, including all the more famous and perfect). Lastly,\r\nItalians probably brought the use of the magnet to higher efficiency;\r\nthough they did not \"invent\" the same, it is likely that they were the\r\nfirst to fit the magnet into a box and connect it with a compass-card.\r\n\"Prima dedit nautis _usum_ magnetis Amalphis.\"\r\n\r\nAlso, we may recall that the Infant Don Pedro, Henry's brother, brought\r\nhome from Venice in 1428 a map illustrating a copy of Marco Polo (see p.\r\nliv of the Introduction to this volume), and that the most important\r\nmap-draughtsmen of the Prince's lifetime were Andrea Bianco, Fra Mauro,\r\nand Gratiosus Benincasa. From 1317, when King Diniz appointed the\r\nGenoese Emmanuele Pesagno Admiral of Portugal, and contracted for a\r\nregular supply of Genoese pilots and captains, down to the Infant's\r\nearlier years, when the Genoese tried to secure a \"lease\" of Sagres\r\npromontory as a naval station, and even to the time when the Venetian\r\nCadamosto sailed in his service (1455-6), and Antoniotto Uso di Mare and\r\nAntonio de Noli were to be found in the same employment, the connection\r\nbetween Portuguese and Italian seamanship was very close--a relationship\r\nalmost of daughter and mother.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 14: (p. 9). _From the islands thou didst people in the\r\nOcean_, etc. ... _wood from those parts._\r\n\r\nHere Azurara gives some references to the products raised in the\r\nnewly-colonised groups of \"African Islands\"--corn, honey, wax, and\r\nespecially wood, on which Santarem remarks:--\r\n\r\n[This interesting detail shows that the wood (Madeira) transported to\r\nPortugal from the islands newly discovered by the Infant D. Henrique,\r\nchiefly from the isle of Madeira, was in such quantity as to cause a\r\nchange in the system of construction of houses in towns, by increasing\r\nthe number of storeys, and raising the height of the houses, thus\r\nbringing in a new style of building instead of the Roman and Arabic\r\nsystems then probably followed. This probability acquires more weight in\r\nview of the system of lighting at Lisbon ordered by King Ferdinand, as\r\nappears from a document in the Archives of the Municipality of Lisbon.\r\nSo this detail related by Azurara is a very curious one for the history\r\nof our architecture.]--S.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 15: (p. 9). _Dwellers in the Algarve_ (_Alfagher_), i.e., the\r\nextreme southern portion of Portugal, including Cape St. Vincent, the\r\ncities of Lagos, Faro and Tavira, and Sagres (off C.

She was not\r\nonly endowed with very eminent qualities, but was also of rare beauty.\r\nShe had great influence on public affairs. The Duke, her husband,\r\ninstituted the celebrated order of the Golden Fleece to celebrate this\r\nmarriage. This princess died at Dijon, December 17th, 1472. From this\r\nalliance came many descendants. She was equally beloved by her brothers,\r\nand especially by King D. Edward (Duarte), who, in his _Leal\r\nConselheiro_ (ch. xliv, \"Da Amizade\"), speaks of the great affection and\r\nregret which he felt for her.

(See Azurara, Hakluyt Soc. ed., vol.\r\ni, Introduction, pp. lxi-lxiii.) We must notice that a little earlier\r\n(p. 13, top of our version), on Azurara's reference to Prince Henry as\r\nan \"uncrowned prince\" (cf. Azurara, vol. ii, Introduction, p. xix).\r\nSantarem remarks:\r\n\r\n[This detail, recorded by Azurara, a contemporary writer, shows the\r\nerror into which Fr. Luiz de Souza fell in his _Historia de S.\r\nDomingos_, liv. vi, fol. 331, by saying that the Infant was elected King\r\nof Cyprus: an error which José Soares da Silva repeated in his _Memorias\r\nd'El Rei D. João I_; whereas if the words of Azurara were not sufficient\r\nto demonstrate the contrary, the dates and facts of history would prove\r\nthe errors of those authors. As a matter of fact, the kingdom of Cyprus,\r\nwhich Richard, King of England, took from the Greeks in 1191, was\r\nimmediately ceded by that Prince to Guy of Lusignan, whose posterity\r\nreigned in that kingdom till 1487; and as our Infant was born in 1394\r\nand died in 1460, it was not possible for him to be elected sovereign of\r\na kingdom ruled by a legitimate line of monarchs. Besides this, in the\r\nlist of the Latin or Frank Kings of Cyprus, the name of D. Henry is not\r\nfound. It is to be presumed that Fr. Luiz de Souza confounded Henry,\r\nPrince of Galilee, son of James I, King of Cyprus, with our Infant D.\r\nHenry.]--S.\r\n\r\nAlso, on the words _Atlas the Giant_ (middle of p. 13 in our version),\r\nthere is another original MS. note:\r\n\r\n[Atlas was king of the land in the west of Europe and of that in the\r\nwest of Africa, brother of Prometheus, that great wise man and\r\nphilosopher descended from Japhet, the giant. And this Atlas was\r\nconsidered the greatest astrologer living in the world at his time. And\r\nhis knowledge of the stars made him give such true forecasts of matters\r\nwhich were fated to happen, that men said in his time that he sustained\r\nthe heaven upon his shoulders. And as Lucas saith, he was the first who\r\ninvented the art of painting in the city of Corinth, which is in\r\nGreece.]\r\n\r\nOn this Santarem remarks:--\r\n\r\n[Here our author mixes up all the historical and mythological traditions\r\nfrom Greek and Latin authors relative to Atlas. Diodorus Siculus and\r\nPlato are not cited by Azurara, who, however, relates that Atlas was\r\nking of the West of Europe and of the West of Africa; but he forgets to\r\nsay that he reigned over the Atlantes, as Herodotus says, and confounds\r\nPrometheus with \"Japhet,\" whose son he was, viz., according to\r\nApollodorus, Diodorus Siculus, and all the ancient writers. Diodorus\r\nsays in effect that Atlas had taught astronomy to Hercules, but our\r\nauthor confounds the three princes of this name, and made a mistake in\r\nciting Lucas de Tuy (continuer of the _Chronicle_ of Isidore of Seville)\r\nas saying that Atlas was the first who invented the art of painting in\r\nthe city of Corinth. The origin of this art was unknown to the ancients.\r\nIt is true that Sicyon and Corinth disputed the glory of the discovery,\r\nbut the discoverer according to most of the ancient authors was\r\nCleanthes of Corinth and not Atlas, as Azurara says. According to\r\nothers, the discovery was due to Philocles the Egyptian.]--S.\r\n\r\nThe Atlas chain of N. Africa has been the subject of persistent\r\nexaggeration. The Greek pillar of heaven (derived from Carthaginian?\r\nseamen) probably referred to Teneriffe. No summit in the Atlas range\r\nanswers to the legend. Though Miltsin rises to 11,400 feet, neither this\r\nnor any other peak can be supposed to represent the idea of towering\r\nheight embodied in the story. We may notice the enormous over-proportion\r\nof the Atlas in some of the most important maps which Prince Henry and\r\nhis seamen had to consult (_e.g._, Dulcert of 1339, the Catalan of\r\n1375).

The conquest of Ceuta\r\n(aided perhaps by the earlier discoveries of Prince Henry's seamen) had\r\nmade some in Portugal eager for more African conquests, and in 1433 King\r\nDuarte (Edward) on his accession was induced by his brothers Henry and\r\nFerdinand, against the opinion of his next brother Pedro, to take up the\r\nproject of an attack on Tangier. The Papal Court gave only a very\r\ndoubtful approval to the war, but on August 22, 1437, an expedition\r\nsailed for Ceuta. Tetuan was captured, and on September 23 Prince Henry\r\nbegan the siege of Tangier, but his attacks on the town were repulsed;\r\nthe Portuguese were surrounded by overwhelming forces which had come\r\ndown from Marocco, Fez, and Tafilet for the relief of the city; and on\r\nOctober 25 the assailants surrendered with the honours of war, on\r\ncondition that Ceuta should be given up with all the Moorish prisoners\r\nthen in Portuguese hands, and that the Portuguese should abstain for 100\r\nyears from any further attack upon the Moors of this part of Barbary.\r\nPrince Ferdinand was left with twelve nobles as hostages for the\r\nperformance of the treaty.

This title was\r\nintroduced into England as early as 1337, and the Infant's mother was\r\nthe daughter of one of the first English dukes, \"old John of Gaunt,\r\ntime-honoured Lancaster.\"]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 27: (p. 17). _The people of Fez ... of Bugya._--This Moslem\r\nleague of 1418 against Portuguese Ceuta comprised nearly all the\r\nneighbouring Islamic states (1) Fez--the centre of Moslem culture in\r\nWestern \"Barbary,\" a very troublesome state, politically, to the great\r\nruling dynasties in N.W. Africa--contained two towns at this time,\r\ncalled respectively the town of the Andalusi, or Spaniards--from the\r\nEuropean (Moslem) emigrants who lived there--and the town of the\r\nKairwani, from Kairwan (\"Cairoan\"), the holy city of Tunis. The founder\r\nof the greatness of Fez was Idris, whose dynasty reigned there A.D.\r\n788-985. It was captured by Abd-el-Mumen ben Ali, the Almohade, in 1145.\r\nIt was also besieged in 960, 979, 1045, 1048, 1069, 1248, 1250. See Leo\r\nAfricanus (Hakluyt Soc. ed.), pp. 143-5, 393, 416-486, 589-606. (2)\r\n_Granada_ was still a Moslem Kingdom, as it remained till its capture by\r\nFerdinand and Isabella in 1492. It was now (1418) ruled by the\r\nsuccessors of Mohammed-al-Hamar, who in 1236 gathered the relics of the\r\nwestern Caliphate into the Kingdom of Granada. In 1340 the Granadine\r\nattempt, in alliance with Berber help from Africa, to recover southern\r\nSpain for Islam, had been defeated in the great battle of the Tarifa, or\r\nSalado (one of the first engagements where cannon were used); but\r\nGranada still (in the fifteenth century) retained considerable strength.\r\n(3) _Tunis._--Leo Africanus mentions its capture by Okba (Akbah) in the\r\nseventh century A.D., by the Almoravides in the eleventh century, and by\r\nAbd-el Mumen ben Ali, the Almohade, in the twelfth century. It was\r\nunsuccessfully attacked at times by those states whose trade with it was\r\nmost important, _e.g._, by Louis IX of France in his crusade of 1270; by\r\nthe Genoese, 1388-90; by the Kings of Sicily, 1289-1335; and by other\r\nforeign states; but remained for the most part independent, from the\r\nbreakup of the Almohade empire till its capture by Barbarossa for the\r\nOttomans in 1531. See Leo Africanus, pp. 699, 716, 753. (4)\r\n_Marocco._--The city of Marocco was founded, A.D. 1070-2 according to\r\nsome, 1062-3 according to others (A.H. 454), by Yusuf Ibn Tashfin, the\r\nAlmoravide. Under both Almoravides and Almohades its greatness steadily\r\nincreased. Abd-el-Mumen ben Ali took it for the latter, and under his\r\ngrandson, Yakub Almansor, it became the Almohade capital (A.D. 1189-90).\r\nThe Beni-Merini succeeding to power in these parts in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, removed the seat of government to Fez (1269-1470). See Leo\r\nAfricanus, pp. 262-272, 351-359. Early in the sixteenth century the\r\nPortuguese, under Nuno Fernandez d'Ataide, Governor of Safi, attacked\r\nMarocco without success. A district called Marocco was much older than\r\nthe city. \"Marakiyah,\" in Masudi (iii, p. 241, Meynard and Courteille),\r\nis used of a district to which the Berbers emigrated. (5) _Bugia_,\r\n_Bougie_, anciently also _Bujaïa_ and _Bejaïa_, a very ancient city.\r\nCarthage had a settlement here; Augustus established a Roman colony with\r\nthe title of Colonia Julia Augusta Saldantum (\"Saldaa\"). It fell into\r\nthe power of the Vandals in the fifth, of the Arabs in the sixth,\r\ncentury; and during the earlier Caliphate it carried on a considerable\r\ntrade, especially with the Christian states of the Western\r\nMediterranean. This trade continued to flourish during the later Middle\r\nAges; and we may instance, not only the favourable descriptions of\r\nEdrisi (_c._ 1154) and of Leo Africanus (1494-1552), but also the Pisan\r\ncommerce (of about 1250-64) both in merchandise and in learning, with\r\nthis city, as well as the Aragonese treaties of 1309 and 1314, and the\r\nPisan embassy of 1378, as a few examples out of many. In 1068, En-Naser\r\nhaving restored and embellished the town, made it his capital, re-naming\r\nit En-Naseria; Abd-el-Mumen ben Ali subjected it to the Almohade empire\r\nin 1152; in 1509 Count Peter of Navarre seized it, and the Spaniards\r\nheld it till 1555. From 1833 it has been a French possession.

Prince Henry seems to have been one of the few men\r\nwho valued aright (before quite modern times) the position from which\r\nthe Arabs advanced to the Conquest of Spain, and from which the English\r\nobtained so great a hold over the Mediterranean. It was only in the\r\nlater sixteenth century that one can discover anything like a widespread\r\nperception of Gibraltar's importance.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 29: (p. 18). _Canary Islands._--Here Azurara probably refers\r\nto the projects of 1424-5, though his words may apply to Henry's efforts\r\nin 1418, or in 1445-6, to acquire the Canaries for Portugal (see\r\nIntroduction to vol. ii, p. xcvi-xcviii).\r\n\r\nThe \"great Armada ... to shew the natives the way of the holy faith\" is\r\nvery characteristic of Azurara.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 30: (p. 18). _Governed Ceuta ... left the government to King\r\nAffonso at the beginning of his reign._--On this, Santarem has the\r\nfollowing note:--\r\n\r\n[The 35 years during which the Infant governed Ceuta must be understood\r\nin the sense that during the reigns of his father and brother and nephew\r\n(till Affonso V reached his majority) he directed the affairs of Ceuta,\r\nbut not that he governed that place by residing there. The dates and\r\nfacts recorded show that we must understand what is here said in this\r\nsense, seeing that the Infant, after the capture of that city (Ceuta) in\r\nAugust 1415, returned to the Kingdom (of Portugal); and there was left\r\nas Governor of Ceuta D. Pedro de Menezes, who held this command for\r\ntwenty-two years (_D. N. do Leão_, cap. 97). The Infant returned to\r\nAfrica in 1437 for the unfortunate campaign of Tangier. After this\r\nexpedition he fell ill in Ceuta and stayed there only five months, and\r\nthence again returned to Portugal, and spent the greater part of his\r\ntime in the Algarve, occupied with his maritime expeditions. He went\r\nback for the third time to Africa with King D. Affonso V for the\r\ncampaign of Alcacer in 1456, returning immediately afterwards to Sagres.\r\n\r\nBeyond this, it should be noticed that the sons of King D. John I had\r\ncharge of the presidency and direction of various branches of State\r\nadministration. D. Duarte (Edward) was, in the life of the King his\r\nfather, entrusted with the presidency of the Supreme Court of Judicature\r\nand with the duty of despatching business in Council, as is recorded by\r\nhim in detail in ch. xxx of the _Leal Conselheiro_. The Infant D. Henry\r\nhad charge of all African business, and so by implication of everything\r\nrelating to Ceuta.\r\n\r\nFinally, the sublime words of King D. Duarte to D. Duarte de Menezes,\r\nwhen he said, \"If I am not deceived in you, not even to give it to a son\r\nof mine will I deprive you of the captaincy of Ceuta\" (Azurara,\r\n_Chronica de D. Duarte_, ch. xliii), show that the Infant D. Henry was\r\nnot then properly Governor of Ceuta; although he was formally appointed\r\nto that post on July 5th, 1450, he never actually occupied it (see\r\nSouza, prov. of Bk. v, No. 51).]--S.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 31: (p. 18). _The fear of his vessels kept in security ...\r\nthe merchants who traded between East and West._--This important detail\r\nhas not been noticed sufficiently in lives of D. Henry. If Azurara\r\nreally means that the Infant's fleet preserved the coasts of Spain from\r\nall fear of the piracy which then, as later, endangered the commerce of\r\nthe Western Mediterranean, we can only regret that no further details\r\nhave come down to us about this point. For such a task the Prince must\r\nhave maintained a pretty large navy: though it is noticeable that piracy\r\nseems to have been worse on the so-called Christian side in the mediæval\r\nperiod; and not till after the fifteenth century, and the establishment\r\nof Turkish suzerainty, was it as bad on the Moslem side (see Mas Latrie,\r\n_Relations de l'Afrique Septentrionale avec les Chrétiens au Moyen Age_,\r\npassim, and especially pp. 4, 5, 61-2, 117, 128-30, 161-208, 340-5, 453,\r\n469, 534). The forbearance of the Barbary States with Christian\r\nfreebooting from the eleventh century to the sixteenth, their tolerance\r\nof Christian colonies in their midst, and the special favours constantly\r\nshown to individual Christians, would surprise those who think only of\r\nAlgerine, Tunisian, or Maroccan piracy and \"Salee rovers.\" Roger II of\r\nSicily is a striking exception to this disgraceful rule. In the earlier\r\nMiddle Ages, some of the Christian Republics of Italy even joined\r\nMoslems in slave-raiding upon other Christians (see _Dawn of Modern\r\nGeography_, pp. 203-4).]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 32: (p. 18). _Peopled five Islands ... especially Madeira_\r\n(see Introduction to vol. ii, pp. xcviii-cii).]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 33: (p. 19). _Alfarrobeira, where ... Don Pedro was ...\r\ndefeated._--D. Pedro, the eldest of the uncrowned sons of King John I,\r\nwas famous for his journeys in Europe, ending in 1428, when he returned\r\nfrom Venice with many treasures, among others a MS. copy of Marco Polo,\r\nand a map of the traveller's route (see Introduction to vol. ii, p.\r\nliv). He was still more famous for his wise government of Portugal as\r\nRegent for his young nephew, Affonso V, 1439-47. He took part in the\r\ncampaign of Ceuta, 1415; advised vainly against the Tangier campaign of\r\n1437; married his daughter Isabel to the King in 1447 (May); was worried\r\ninto a semblance of rebellion, 1448-9, and was killed in a battle at the\r\nrivulet of Alfarrobeira, between Aljubarrota and Lisbon, in May 1449.\r\n\r\nOn his companion, the Count of Avranches (\"Dabranxes\" in Azurara),\r\nSantarem has a note remarking that he, D. Alvaro Vaz d'Almada, was [made\r\na Count (of Avranches) in Normandy, by gift of the King of England\r\n(Henry V), after the battle of Azincourt, when he was also created a\r\nknight of the Order of the Garter.]\r\n\r\nHe was sometimes called, in the affected Renaissance fashion of the\r\ntime, the \"Spanish Hercules;\" but he also had fallen into disfavour with\r\nAffonso V.

It was founded originally as a house of the Templars by\r\nDonna Theresa, mother of Affonso Henriques, first King of Portugal; it\r\nwas enlarged and rebuilt in 1180 and 1320.

So named ... by\r\nwriting._--The settlement at Sagres. On this Santarem has the following\r\nnotes:--\r\n\r\n[α. We see by our author's account what was the state in 1453 of the\r\ntown of which the Infant had laid the foundations in 1416, and to which\r\nat first was given the name of \"Tercena Naval\" (Naval Arsenal), from the\r\nVenetian word \"Darcena,\" an arsenal for the construction and docking of\r\ngalleys; it afterwards received the name of Villa do Infante (the\r\nInfant's town), and later on that of Sagres--derived from Sagro, Sacrum,\r\nthe famous Promontorium Sacrum of the ancients, according to D.\r\nFrancisco Manoel, _Epanaphoras_, p. 310. It should be noted that the\r\ncelebrated Cadamosto, who had speech with the Infant in 1455, at Cape\r\nSt. Vincent, does not give the name of the town, though he speaks of the\r\ninterview which he had with him (Henry) at Rapozeira].\r\n\r\n[β. In writing \"Callez\" for \"Cadiz\" in this paragraph, our author\r\nfollows the corrupt nomenclature of the authors and MSS. of the Middle\r\nAges, which altered the name of that city from the Gades of Pliny (v,\r\n19), Macrobius, Silius Italicus (xvi, 468), Columella (viii, ch. xvi), a\r\nform more like the primitive Gadir (a hedge) in the Phœnician or Punic\r\nlanguage. The corrupt terms Calles, Callis, etc., are, however, met with\r\neven in documents of the sixteenth century. See the letters of Vespucci\r\nin the edition of Gruninger (1509)].\r\n\r\n[γ. As to this reference to the Genoese (desiring to buy Sagres from\r\nPortugal), the meaning must be that they offered great sums of money for\r\nthe concession of a place in the new town for the establishment there of\r\na factory, and perhaps of a colony, similar to those they possessed in\r\nthe Black Sea, as especially Caffa (now Theodosia, in the Crimea), or\r\nSmyrna in the Archipelago. It is, however, improbable that they proposed\r\nto the Infant the cession of a town of which he did not hold the\r\nsovereignty. The Republic of Genoa had preserved very close relations\r\nwith Portugal from the commencement of the monarchy, and could not be\r\nignorant that even the Sovereigns of the country were not able to\r\nalienate any portion of the land without the consent of the Cortes (on\r\nthis subject see Part III of our _Memorias sobre as Cortes_). Howsoever\r\nthe case may have been, the detail referred to by our author illustrates\r\nthe prudence of the Portuguese Government of that time in having\r\nresisted such a proposal, in view of the fact that the Republic of Genoa\r\nhad by its immense naval power obtained from the Moorish and African\r\nprinces the concession of various important points in Asia and Africa;\r\nand had also procured from the Greek Emperors the cession of the suburbs\r\nof Pera and Galata in Constantinople, and the isles of Scios, Mitylene\r\n(Lesbos), and Tenedos in the Archipelago. The reader will find it worth\r\nhis attention that Portugal refused to accede to a similar offer when\r\nthe Emperors of the East and of Germany, the Kings of Sicily, Castile,\r\nAragon, and the Sultans of Egypt constantly sought the alliance of that\r\nRepublic and the protection of its powerful marine. True it is that the\r\npower of Genoa had already then begun to decline and to become\r\nenfeebled, but none the less important are the details given by Azurara\r\nand the observations which we have offered for the consideration of the\r\nreader].\r\n\r\nAs to the connections of Genoa with Spain, we may add the following:--\r\n\r\nGenoese relations with Barcelona became active in the twelfth century.\r\nIn 1127 the Republic concluded a commercial treaty with Count Raymond\r\nBerenger III, and formed an offensive and defensive alliance with the\r\nsame Prince in 1147. As a result, the allies took Almeria and Tortosa.\r\nIn this conquest two-thirds went to the Count, one-third to the Genoese.\r\nIn 1153 they sold their new possessions to Count Raymond for money and\r\ntrading rights; but in 1149 they concluded a treaty of peace and\r\ncommerce with the Moorish King of Valencia, and in 1181 a similar treaty\r\nwith the King of Majorca. As early as 1315 the Genoese had begun a\r\ndirect trade by sea with the Low Countries, passing round the Spanish\r\ncoast. After the conquest of Seville by Ferdinand III they also obtained\r\nimportant trade privileges in that city, especially those enjoyed by a\r\ngrant of May 22nd, 1251. By this time they had ousted all their Italian\r\nrivals in the trade of the Western Mediterranean, and there held a\r\nposition analogous almost to that of Venice under the Latin empire of\r\nConstantinople. In 1267 all the Genoese consuls in Spain were put under\r\na Consul-General at Ceuta. In 1278 Genoa concluded a treaty of peace and\r\ncommerce with Granada. In 1317 the Genoese, Emmanuel Pessanha (Pezagno),\r\nbecame Lord High Admiral of Portugal: Genoese captains and pilots were\r\nemployed in the Spanish exploring voyage to the Canaries in 1341; and a\r\nregular contingent of Genoese pilots and captains was maintained in the\r\nSpanish service.

The \"height\" of which Azurara speaks is the Parthenon, or Temple of\r\nMinerva, in Athens. The famous statue of that goddess, in gold and\r\nivory, was made by that famous sculptor (Phidias), and placed by the\r\nAthenians in that magnificent temple]. Cf. Pliny, _Nat. Hist._, Bk.\r\nxxxiv, ch. xix.\r\n\r\n[β. The philosopher is Aristotle. It is not unworthy of note that our\r\nauthor cites Aristotle in this place, and prefers his authority to that\r\nof Pausanias. This preference, which may also be frequently observed in\r\nthe _Leal Conselheiro_ of King D. Duarte, proves the great esteem in\r\nwhich the works of the Stagyrite philosopher were held among our\r\nancestors (as well as in other nations) during the Middle Ages. Our\r\nlearned men followed him in preference to Pausanias, even when treating\r\nof the antiquities of Greece].]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 40: (p. 23). _Great Valerius._--Here again Santarem:--[This\r\nauthor, cited by Azurara, is Valerius Maximus, a writer of the time of\r\nTiberius, who wrote _De dictis factisque memorabilibus_ in nine books.\r\nHe was a native of Rome, and therefore Azurara says, \"of thy city.\"]\r\nAzurara is not mistaken, as Santarem suggests, in assuming that the\r\nRoman author did not only deal with the deeds of his compatriots but\r\nalso described those of foreigners. Of the main divisions of V.'s work,\r\nthe first book is devoted chiefly to religious and ritual matters, the\r\nsecond to various civil institutions, the third and three following\r\nbooks to social virtues; the seventh book treats of many different\r\nsubjects. This treatise was very popular in the Middle Ages, and several\r\nabridgments were made, one by Julius Paris.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 41: (p. 24). _What Romulus ... Manlius Torquatus ...

Manlius Torquatus, the dictator, is here seemingly referred to; on\r\nwhom see _Livy_, vii, 4, and _Plutarch_, i].\r\n\r\nThe contrast of Cæsar's gaiety with the strictness of Henry's life\r\nrefers us to ch. iv (beginning), pp. 12, 13, of this version. Azurara\r\nhad but a very inadequate conception (supplement from Cadamosto, Pacheco\r\nPereira, and Barros) of the real scope of Henry's life-work, and his\r\nremarks sometimes sink into mere flattery; but the comparisons he makes\r\nhere are not misjudged. The Infant was really one of the men who, like\r\nCæsar, Alexander, Peter I of Russia, or Mohammed, force us to think how\r\ndifferent the history of the world would have been without them.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 42: (p. 24). _Captain of their Armies._--Here\r\nSantarem:--[This detail is so interesting for the history of that epoch,\r\nthat we judge it opportune to indicate here, for the illustration of our\r\ntext, the names of these sovereigns. The invitation given by the Pope\r\n(as recorded here) to the Infant could only have taken place after the\r\ntaking of Ceuta, a campaign in which the Prince acquired immortal glory,\r\nhaving commanded the squadron and been first of the princes to enter the\r\nfortress. In view of this, it appears to us that only after 1415 could\r\nthis proposal have been made by the Pontiff; and also it seems as if the\r\noffer must have been made to him before the unfortunate campaign of\r\nTangier in 1437, during the time in which the Infant was exclusively\r\noccupied with the business of the Kingdom and of Africa, and with his\r\nexpeditions and discoveries. From this it appears likely that the Pope\r\nwho invited him to become general of his armies was Martin V, and the\r\nyear of the invitation 1420 or 1421, after the embassy which, the Greek\r\nEmperor, Manuel Palaeologus, sent to the Pontiff to beg for aid against\r\nthe Turks. The Emperor of Germany of whom Azurara speaks was Sigismund\r\n(Siegmund), who, by reason of his close relations with the Court of\r\nLisbon, and with the ambassadors of Portugal at the Council of\r\nConstance, could appreciate the eminent qualities of the Infant, and\r\nform the high opinion of him which he deserved. Lastly, the Kings of\r\nCastile and England of whom Azurara speaks must be D. John II, and Henry\r\nV.]--S. Santarem is probably wrong here. \"Henry VI\" should be read for\r\n\"Henry V;\" see Introduction to vol. ii, p. xv.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 43: (p. 25). _Discipline ... clemency._--Azurara here\r\nimitates somewhat the formal disputations of Seneca and Cicero. We may\r\nespecially compare Seneca's _De Ira_, _De Providentia_, and _De\r\nClementia ad Neronem Caesarem libri duo_; also, but with rather less\r\nclose a parallelism, the same writer's _De Animi tranquillitate_, _De\r\nConstantia Sapientis_. The Elder Seneca's rhetorical exercises,\r\n_Controversiarum libri X_, and _Suasoriarum Liber_, were also, as far as\r\nthe form goes, models for such discussions as are here conducted.\r\nAzurara's point, of course, is that, of the two extremes, Prince Henry\r\nleaned rather to \"clemency\" than to \"discipline;\" and though he by no\r\nmeans neglected the latter, he was content rather to err in generosity\r\nthan in severity. Precisely the opposite is the view of some modern\r\nstudents: _e.g._, Oliveira Martins, _Os Filhos de D. João I_, especially\r\npp. 59-63, 210-1, 267-270, 311-346.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 44: (p. 26). _St. Chrysostom ... something to asperse._--As\r\nto the Prince's critics, though in a slightly different sense, cp. what\r\nAzurara says in ch. xviii (beginning). The modern criticisms of the\r\nInfant's conduct may be read in O. Martins (_Os Filhos_, as cited in\r\nlast note). According to this view, the Infant's genius was pitiless: he\r\ncared little or nothing for the captivity and torture of D. Fernando the\r\nConstant, who died in his Moorish prison after the disaster of Tangier;\r\nfor the broken heart and premature end of D. Edward; or for the fate of\r\nD. Pedro. As little did he care for the misery of the Africans killed or\r\nenslaved by his captains, or for the unhappy life of Queen Leonor,\r\nmother of Affonso V. Not only was he indifferent to these sufferings,\r\nbut indirectly or directly he was the efficient cause of the same. This\r\nextreme view, as regards the slave-raiding, is much weakened by\r\nCadamosto's testimony, and Azurara's own admission in ch. xcvi (end) of\r\nthis Chronicle (see Introduction to vol. ii, p. xxv). The truth seems to\r\nlie between Azurara and Martins: between the conceptions of Henry as a\r\nSt. Louis and as a Bismarck.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 45: (p. 26). _Seneca ... first tragedy._--This is the\r\n_Hercules Furens_ of the great--or younger--Seneca, the philosopher.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 46: (p. 27). _St. Brandan ... returned._--On this Santarem\r\nwrites:--\r\n\r\n[The voyage of St. Brandan, to which Azurara refers, is reputed\r\nfabulous, like the island of the same name. According to this tradition,\r\nit was said that St. Brandan arrived in the year 565 at an island near\r\nthe Equinoctial(?). This legend was preserved among the inhabitants of\r\nMadeira and of Gomera, who believed that they were able to see Brandan's\r\nisle towards the west at a certain time of the year. This appearance\r\nwas, however, the result of certain meteorological circumstances.\r\nAzurara became acquainted with this tradition of the Middle Ages from\r\nsome copy of the MS. of the thirteenth century, entitled _Imago Mundi de\r\ndispositione Orbis_, of Honorius of Autun; and this circumstance is so\r\nmuch the more curious as Azurara could not have been acquainted with the\r\nfamous Mappemonde of Fra Mauro, which was only executed between the\r\nyears 1457-9; and still less with the Planisphere of Martin of Bohemia\r\n(Behaim), which is preserved at Nuremburg, on which appears depicted at\r\nthe Equinoctial a great island, with the following legend: _In the year\r\n565 St. Brandan came with his ship to this island._ The famous Jesuit,\r\nHenschenius, who composed a critical examination of the life of St.\r\nBrandan, says of it:--\"Cujus historia, ut fabulis referta, omittitur.\"]\r\nThe Bollandists speak with equal distrust of the Brandan story.\r\n\r\nTo this we may add:--It is possible Azurara may have read the original\r\n_Navigatio Sti. Brendani_. The legendary voyage of Brandan is usually\r\ndated in 565, but this is probably a mere figure of speech. He was\r\nsupposed to have sailed west from Ireland (his home was at Clonfert on\r\nthe Middle Shannon) in search of Paradise, and to have made discoveries\r\nof various islands in the Ocean, all associated with fantastic\r\nincidents: as the Isle of St. Patrick and St. Ailbhé, inhabited by Irish\r\nCœnobites; the isle of the Hermit Paul, at or near which Brandan met\r\nwith Judas Iscariot floating on an iceberg; the Isle of the Whale's\r\nBack, and the Paradise of Birds; to say nothing of the Isle of the\r\nCyclops, the Mouth of Hell, and the Land of the Saints--the last\r\nencircled in a zone of mist and darkness which veiled it from profane\r\nsearch. It is more than probable that the Brandan tradition, as we have\r\nit, is mainly compiled from the highly-coloured narratives of some Arab\r\nvoyagers, such as Sinbad the Sailor in the Indian Ocean, and the\r\nWanderers (Maghrurins) of Lisbon in the Atlantic (as recorded in\r\n_Edrisi_, Jaubert, ii, 26-29), with some help from classical\r\ntravel-myth; that it is only in very small part referable to any\r\nhistorical fact; that this fact is to be found in the contemporary\r\nvoyages of Irish hermits to the Hebrides, Orkneys, Shetlands, Faroes,\r\nand Iceland; that a certain special appropriateness may be found in the\r\nfar western Scottish island of St. Kildas (Holy Culdees) or the islet of\r\nRockall; and that some of the matter in the Brandan story is derived\r\nfrom the travels of early Christian pilgrims to Palestine, _e.g._,\r\nBernard the Wise, _c._ 867. It is important to remember that the\r\ntradition, though professing to record facts of the sixth century, is\r\nnot traceable in any MS. record before the eleventh century; but, like\r\nso many other matters of mediæval tradition, its popularity was just in\r\ninverse proportion to its certainty, and \"St. Brandan's isle\" was a\r\ndeeply-rooted prejudice of the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and even\r\nfifteenth centuries. Down to the middle of the sixteenth century it\r\nusually found a place on maps of the Western Ocean, usually due west of\r\nIreland (see _Dawn of Modern Geography_, pp. 230-240, and references in\r\nsame to other works, p. 239, _n._ 2, especially to De Goeje's _La\r\nlégende de Saint Brandan_, 1890; Avezac's _Iles fantastique de l'Océan\r\nOccidental_, 1845; Schirmer, _Zur Brendanus Legende_, 1888; and the\r\nstudy of _Schröder_, 1871). We may note that Azurara is (for his time)\r\nsomewhat exceptional in his hesitating reference to the Brandan story;\r\nbut of course his object led him, however unconsciously, to minimise\r\nforeign claims of precedence against the Portuguese on the Western\r\nOcean. As far as Brandan goes, no one would now contradict the Prince's\r\napologist; but more formidable rivals to a literal acceptance of the\r\nabsolute Portuguese priority along the north-west coasts of Africa are\r\nto be found in Italian, French, and Catalan voyagers of the thirteenth\r\nand fourteenth centuries, one of which is perhaps alluded to here by\r\nAzurara. For \"the two galleys which rounded the Cape (Bojador) but never\r\nreturned\" were probably the ships of Tedisio Doria and the Vivaldi, who\r\nin 1291 (_aliter_ 1281) left Genoa \"to go by sea to the ports of India\r\nto trade there,\" reached Cape Nun, and, according to a later story,\r\n\"sailed the sea of Ghinoia to a city of Ethiopia.\" In 1312, we are told,\r\nenquiry had failed to learn anything more of them (see Introduction to\r\nvol. ii, pp. lxi-lxiii).]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 47: (p. 28). _Power of ...

This passage shows that the Portuguese mariners already, before the\r\nexpedition of Gil Eannes, knew that beyond Cape Bojador the great desert\r\nof the Sahara was to be met with, and that the land was not less sandy\r\nthan that of \"Libya.\" This last term of Plinian geography, and the\r\ncircumstances which the author relates in this chapter, show that before\r\nthese expeditions our seamen had collected all the notices upon that\r\npart of the African continent found in the ancient geographers, and in\r\nthe accounts of the Moors of the caravans which traversed the great\r\ndesert. This is confirmed by what Azurara says in ch. lxxvii, as we\r\nshall see in due course].\r\n\r\n[β. The reader will observe from this passage that in spite of the\r\nhydrographical knowledge which our mariners had already obtained of\r\nthose coasts, from their imperfect understanding of what are called the\r\nPelagic currents, those sailors of the fifteenth century still feared\r\nthe great perils which the passage of that Cape offered to their\r\nimagination. Azurara makes clear to us here how powerful, even at this\r\nepoch, was the influence of the traditions of the Arabic geographers\r\nabout the Sea of Darkness, which according to them existed beyond the\r\nisles of Kalidad (the Canaries), situated at the extremity of the Mogreb\r\nof Africa. See Edrisi, Backoui, and Ibn-al-Wardi. Lastly, on the\r\nsuperstitious and other fears of mediæval navigators, the reader can\r\nconsult the _Itinera Mundi_ of Abraham Peritsol, translated from Hebrew\r\ninto Latin by Hyde]. Cf. Introduction to vol. ii, p. x. Cape Bojador, in\r\nN. lat. 26° 6' 57\", W. long. (Paris) 16° 48' 30\", is thus described by\r\nthe most recent French surveys: \"Viewed from the north there is nothing\r\nremarkable, but from the west there appears a cliff of about 20 metres\r\nin height. A little bay opens on the south of the Cape.\"]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 50: (p. 32). _Virgin Themis ... returned to the Kingdom very\r\nhonourably._\r\n\r\nOn the first words there is this original MS. note:--[It is to be\r\nunderstood that near to Mount Parnassus, which is in the midst between\r\neast and west, are two hill tops, which contend with the snows. And in\r\none of these was a cave, in which in the time of the Heathen, Apollo\r\ngave responses to certain priestly virgins who served in a temple which\r\nwas there dedicated to the said Apollo. And those virgins dwelt by the\r\nfountains of the Castalian mount. And among these virgins was that\r\nvirgin Themis, whom some held to be one of the Sibyls. And it is said\r\nthat those virgins were so fearful of entering into that cave, that,\r\nsave on great constraint they dared not do so--according as Lucan\r\nrelateth in his fifth book and sixth chapter, where he speaketh of the\r\nresponse which the Consul Appius received, on the end of the war between\r\nCæsar and Pompey.]\r\n\r\nOn this Santarem remarks:--\r\n\r\n[Both in this note and in those on pp. 10, 11, 12, and 21 ( = pp. 7-8,\r\n13, of this version), which are met with in our MS., and are in the same\r\nscript, there prevails such a confusion of thought that we hesitate in\r\nsupposing them to have been written by Azurara. These notes, so far from\r\nillustrating the text, themselves call for elucidation. Here the writer\r\nfollows the opinion of the ancients as to the position of Parnassus,\r\nviz., that it was situated in the middle of the world, though, according\r\nto Strabo, it was placed between Phocis and Locris. As to its\r\n\"contending with the snows,\" the writer of this note, who quotes Lucan,\r\nseems to have taken this passage from Ovid rather than from the\r\n_Pharsalia_. See Ovid, _Metamorphoses_, I, v, 316-7; Lucan, _Pharsalia_,\r\nV, v, 72-3. The cave is the Antrum Corysium of the Poets. See the\r\n_Journey to Greece_ of the famous archæologist Spon. The passages\r\nreferred to as from Bk. V of the Pharsalia are those beginning with the\r\nlines--_Hisperio tantum_ ... and v, 114, _Nec voce negata_ ... together\r\nwith line 120, _Sic tempore longo_, and the following lines.]\r\n\r\nOn the \"honourable return\" of these caravels, with \"booty of the\r\nInfidels,\" from the Levant Seas, we may compare the text on p. 18, and\r\nnote (31) to the same. Here Santarem remarks:--\r\n\r\n[The attempts made by the Portuguese seamen to pass the Cape began\r\nbefore the fifteenth century. Already, in the time of King Affonso IV,\r\nthe Portuguese passed beyond Cape Non, _i.e._, before 1336 (?). The\r\ndocuments published by Professor Ciampi in 1827, and discovered by him\r\nin the _MSS. of Boccaccio_ in the Bibliotheca Magliabechiana in\r\nFlorence, as well as the letter of King Affonso IV to Pope Clement VI\r\nattest that fact. See the _Memoir_ of Sr. J. J. da Costa de Macedo, in\r\nvol. vi. of the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Lisbon, and\r\nthe additions published in 1835. As for the attempts made in the\r\nPrince's time by ships that he sent into those latitudes to pass beyond\r\nCape Bojador, if we admit the number of twelve years which Azurara\r\nindicates, and if this is taken together with the date 1433, which he\r\nfixes for the passage effected by Gil Eannes(?), the result is that\r\nthese attempts began only in 1421; and so Azurara did not admit that the\r\nexpedition of 1418 (or of 1419), which went out under J. G. Zarco, had\r\nfor its chief object the passage of the Cape at all. But from Barros it\r\nis seen that Zarco and Vaz went out with the object of doubling the\r\nCape, but that a storm carried them to the island they discovered, and\r\nnamed Porto Santo (_Decades I_, ch. 2, and D. Franc. Manoel,\r\n_Epanaphoras_, p. 313]. The statements of part of this note are loosely\r\nworded. See Introduction to vol. ii, on the voyage of 1341, on the\r\nearlier claims of Affonso IV, and on the rounding of Bojador.]\r\n\r\nAlso, on Azurara's use of _Graada_ for _Granada_, Santarem remarks: [On\r\nthe origin and etymology of this word, see Cortes y Lopez, art. _Ebura\r\nquae Cerialis. Dic. Geograf. Hist. de la Esp. Ant._, II., 420, etc.].\r\n\r\nAnd on the \"Granada\" and \"Levant\" expeditions, the same editor remarks:\r\n[The details of these expeditions prove the activity of our marine at\r\nthe beginning of the fifteenth century, and its system of training,\r\nwhich enabled it to cope better with the perils of Ocean voyages, and in\r\nnaval combats with Arabs and Moors to protect the commerce of the\r\nChristian nations in the Mediterranean].

See Introduction to vol. ii, pp. x-xiii, lxi-lxxi.\r\n\r\n[The events which interrupted the Infant's expeditions and discoveries\r\nfrom 1437 to 1440 may be briefly indicated. The Infant returned to the\r\nAlgarve after the expedition to Tangier (1437), and was there in\r\nSeptember of the following year, when King Edward fell ill at Thomar. On\r\nthe King's death, the Prince was at once summoned by the Queen, and\r\ncharged by her to concert with the Infant D. Pedro, and with the\r\ngrandees of the realm, some means of grappling with the difficulties of\r\nthe Kingdom. The Infant convoked these persons, who decided that the\r\nCortes ought to be assembled to pass the resolutions they judged\r\nexpedient.\r\n\r\nThe Prince thought that D. Pedro ought to sign the summonses; but as he\r\nrefused to do this, they were all signed by the Queen, with the proviso\r\nthat such signature should hold good only till the Assembly of the\r\nEstates should settle the question.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Infant, on account of his accustomed prudence, was\r\nchosen mediator between the Queen and D. Pedro. At his proposal,\r\ndiscussed in various conferences, the Queen was charged with the\r\neducation of her children and the administration of their property;\r\nwhile to the Infant D. Pedro was given the administration and government\r\nof the Kingdom, with the title of Defender of the Kingdom for the King\r\n(_Ruy de Pina_, ch. xv).\r\n\r\nBut, as a large party did not agree to this, and so public disorder\r\nincreased, Henry sought to conciliate the different parties by getting\r\ntheir consent to an Accord, published November 9th, 1438, providing:--\r\n\r\n1. That the education of the King while a minor, and of his brothers,\r\nand the power of nominating to Court Offices, should rest with the\r\nQueen; and that a sum should be paid her sufficient to defray the\r\nexpenses of the Royal Household.\r\n\r\n2. The Royal Council was to consist of six members, who should be\r\ncharged in turn and at definite periods with such business of state as\r\nwas within their power to decide, conformably to the regulations of the\r\nCortes.\r\n\r\n3. Besides this Council there was to be elected a permanent deputation\r\nof the Estates, to reside at the Court, composed of one prelate, one\r\nfidalgo, and one burgess or citizen, to be elected, each by his\r\nrespective estate, for a year.\r\n\r\n4. All the business of the Royal Council was to be conducted by the six\r\ncouncillors and the deputation of the Three Estates under the presidency\r\nof the Queen, with the approval and consent of the Infant D. Pedro.\r\n\r\nIf the votes were equal, the business in question was to be submitted to\r\nthe Infants, the Counts, and the Archbishop, and to be decided by the\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nIf the Queen agreed with the Infant D. Pedro, their vote was to be\r\ndecisive, even though the whole Council should be against them.\r\n\r\n5. All the business of the Treasury, except what belonged to the Cortes,\r\nwas to be conducted by the Queen and the Infant: decrees and orders on\r\nthe subject were to be signed by both, and the Controllers of the\r\nTreasury were to be charged with their execution.\r\n\r\n6. It was settled that the Cortes should be summoned every year to\r\nsettle any doubts which the Council could not decide for themselves,\r\nsuch as \"the [condemnation to] death of great personages, the\r\ndeprivation of state servants from great offices, the [confiscation or]\r\nloss of lands, the amendment of old or the making of new laws and\r\nordinances; and it was also agreed that future Cortes should be able to\r\ncorrect or amend any defect or error in past sessions\" (_Ruy de Pina_,\r\nch. xv). The Queen, however, being induced by a violent party to resist,\r\nrefused to agree to these resolutions, in spite of the vigorous efforts\r\nof D. Henry. This produced great excitement, and in the Cortes it was\r\nproposed to confer the sole regency on D. Pedro. It should be noted that\r\nPrince Henry expressed his disapproval of all the resolutions of the\r\nmunicipality of Lisbon and other assemblies, declaring that they\r\nillegally tried to rob the Cortes of its powers. Equally plain was his\r\nindignation when he learned that the Queen had fortified herself in\r\nAlemquer, and had invoked the aid of the Infants of Aragon.\r\n\r\nHe did not hesitate to go to Alemquer in person, and induce the Queen to\r\nreturn to Lisbon, in order to present the young King to the Cortes\r\n(1439); and such was the respect felt for him (Henry) that the Queen,\r\nwho had resisted all other persuasions, yielded to the Infant's.\r\n\r\nIn the following year the divisions of the Kingdom compelled the Infant\r\nto occupy himself with public business, the conciliation of parties, and\r\nthe prevention of a civil war.]--S.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 58: (p. 39). _Chronicle of D.

Santarem's derivation of the word\r\n\"Saracen\" is much disputed.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 65: (p. 50). _Lisbon Harbour_ ...--Here, perhaps, Azurara\r\nrefers to the broad expanse of the Tagus, opposite the present Custom\r\nHouse and Marine Arsenal of Lisbon. \"The broad estuary of the Tagus\r\ngives Lisbon an extensive and safe harbour.\" From the suburb of Belem\r\nup to the western end of Lisbon, the Tagus is little more than a mile\r\nin width, but opposite the central quays of the city the river widens\r\nconsiderably, the left, or southern, bank turning suddenly to the\r\nsouth near the town of Almada, and forming a wide bay, reach, or road\r\nabout 5½ miles in breadth, and extending far to the north-east. \"In\r\nthis deep lake-like expansion all the fleets of Europe might be\r\nanchored.\"]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 66: (p. 50). _Cabo Branco._--[In lat. N. 20° 46' 55\",\r\naccording to Admiral Roussin's observations.]--S. According to the most\r\nrecent French surveys, it is thus described:--\"Il forme, au S., sur\r\nl'Atlantique, l'extrémité d'une presqu'île aride et sablonneuse de 40\r\nkil. de longeur environ, large de 4 à 5 kil., qui couvre a l'O. la baie\r\nLévrier, partie la plus enfoncée au N. de la baie d'Arguin. Cette\r\npresqu'île se termine par un plateau dont le cap forme l'escarpement; le\r\nsommet surplomb la mer de 25 m. environ. Des éboulements de sable, que\r\nle soleil colore d'une nuance éblouissante, lui ont valu son nom. 'Le\r\nCap Blanc est d'une access facile. Il est entouré de bons mouillages\r\nqui, au point de vue maritime, rendent cette position préférable à celle\r\nd'Arguin' (Fulcrand).\"]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 67: (p. 53). _Eugenius the Bishop._--[Barros adds certain\r\nreasons for this request; he says, \"the Infant, whose intent in\r\ndiscovering these lands was chiefly to draw the barbarous nations under\r\nthe yoke of Christ, and for his own glory and the praise of these\r\nKingdoms, with increase of the royal patrimony, having ascertained the\r\nstate of those people and their countries from the captives whom Antam\r\nGonçalvez and Nuno Tristam had brought home--willed to send this news to\r\nMartin V (?), asking him, in return for the many years' labour and the\r\ngreat expense he and his countrymen had bestowed on this discovery, to\r\ngrant in perpetuity to the Crown of these Kingdoms all the land that\r\nshould be discovered over this our Ocean Sea from C. Bojador to the\r\nIndies\" (Barros, _Decade I_, i, 7).]--S. Barros here apparently confuses\r\nMartin V with Eugenius IV.\r\n\r\n[Besides this bull, Pope Nicholas V granted another, dated January 8th,\r\n1450, conceding to King D. Affonso V all the territories which Henry had\r\ndiscovered (Archives of Torre do Tombo, _Maç. 32 de bullas_ No. 1). On\r\nJanuary 8th, 1454, the same Pope ratified and conceded by another bull\r\nto Affonso V, Henry, and all the Kings of Portugal their successors, all\r\ntheir conquests in Africa, with the islands adjacent, from Cape Bojador,\r\nand from Cape Non as far as all Guinea, with the whole of the south\r\ncoast of the same.

Africa, so acquired by Portugal, as well as\r\nwhat should be acquired in future, could only be made by the Kings of\r\nPortugal; and he confirmed the bulls of Martin V and Nicholas V: cf.\r\nanother bull of Sixtus IV, June 21st, 1481, and see Barros, _Decade I_,\r\ni, 7; _Arch.

Under the Khalifs, this Sahara\r\ncommerce extended itself to the western extremity of the continent, and\r\neven to Spain. The caravans crossed the valleys and plains of Suz, Darah\r\nand Tafilet to the south of Morocco. Cf. the _Geographia Nubiensis_ of\r\nEdrisi (1619 ed.), pp. 7, 11, 12, 14; Hartmann's _Edrisi_, pp. 26, 49,\r\n133-4. This gold came from the negro-land called Wangara, as Edrisi and\r\nIbn-al-Wardi tell us. See _Notices et extraits des MSS. de la\r\nBibliothèque du Roi_, fo. 11, pp. 33 and 37: so Leo Africanus and Marmol\r\ny Carvajal speak of the gold of Tiber, brought from Wangara. \"Tiber\" is\r\nfrom the Arab word Thibr = gold (cf. Walckenaer, _Recherches\r\ngéographiques_, p. 14). So Cadamosto, speaking of the commerce of\r\nArguim, says, ch. x, that men brought there \"gold of Tiber;\" and Barros,\r\n_Decade I_, ch. vii, in describing the Rio d' Ouro, refers to the same\r\nthing:--\"A quantity of gold-dust, the first obtained in these parts,\r\nwhence the place was called the Rio d' Ouro, though it is only an inlet\r\nof salt water running up into the country about six leagues.\"]--S.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 75: (p. 58). _Gete_ (or Arguim).--[Barros, _Decade I_, 7,\r\nsays: \"Nuno Tristam on this voyage went on as far as an island which the\r\npeople of the country called Adeget, and which we now call Arguim.\" The\r\nArab name was \"Ghir,\" which Azurara turns into \"Gete,\" Barros into\r\n\"Arget.\" The discovery and possession of this point was of great\r\nimportance for the Portuguese. It helped them to obtain news of the\r\ninterior, and to establish relations with the negro states on the\r\nSenegal and Gambia. The Infant began to build a fort on Arguim in 1448.\r\nCadamosto gives a long account of the state of commercial relations\r\nwhich the Portuguese had established there with the dwellers in the\r\nupland; and the Portuguese pilot, author of the _Navigation to the Isle\r\nof St. Thomas_ (1558), published by Ramusio, says of Arguim: \"Here there\r\nis a great port and a castle of the King our Lord with a garrison and a\r\nfactor. Arguim is inhabited by black-a-moors, and this is the point\r\nwhich divides Barbary from Negroland.\" Cf. Bordone's _Isolario_ (1528)\r\non the Portuguese trade with the interior. In 1638 this factory and\r\nfortress were taken by the Dutch.]--S.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent changes of this position may be briefly noticed. After\r\npassing, in 1665, from the Dutch to the English and afterwards back\r\nagain, in 1678 from the Dutch to the French, in 1685 from the French to\r\nthe Dutch, in 1721 once more falling into French hands, only to be\r\nrecovered shortly afterwards by the Netherlanders, it became definitely\r\nand finally a French possession in 1724, and at present forms part of\r\nthe great North-West African empire of the Third Republic. At the\r\nnorthern extremity of the Bight of Arguim, or a little beyond, near Cape\r\nBlanco, is the present boundary between the French and Spanish spheres\r\nof influence in this part of the world.\r\n\r\nThe native boats, worked by \"bodies in the canoes and legs in the\r\nwater,\" must be, Santarem remarks, what the Portuguese call \"jangadas.\"]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 75A: (p. 59). _An infinity of Royal Herons._--[The Isle of\r\nHerons is one of the Arguim islands; cf.

[In Bordone's _Isolario_ (1533) all three of the\r\nislands noticed by Azurara (Naar, Garças and Tider), are indicated with\r\nthe title of Isles of Herons [Ilhas das Garças]. The same is to be found\r\nin the Venetian map of Gastaldi, and in others. In the Portuguese Atlas\r\njust cited, and in another Portuguese chart made in Lisbon by Domingos\r\nSanchez in 1618, these islands are depicted as close to the coast of\r\nArguim, but without any name.] As to Cabo Branco [This name was,\r\napparently, given it by Nuno Tristam.]--S.

It was a sign of what was to follow, for the native resistance\r\nnow began to show itself, and the very next European slave-raiders\r\n(Gonçallo de Sintra and his men) were roughly handled, and most of them\r\nkilled (see ch. xxvii. of this Chronicle).]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 80: (p. 80). _Friar ...

The place where De Sintra perished is fourteen\r\nleagues S. of the Rio do Ouro, and in maps, both manuscript and\r\nengraved, from the close of the fifteenth century, it took the name\r\n_Golfo de Gonçallo de Cintra_]. The reference in the concluding words of\r\nthis chapter, _as had been commanded, etc._, is to the passage on p. 87\r\nof this version, towards the foot: \"That he should go straight to\r\nGuinea, and for nothing whatever should fail of this:\" an order which De\r\nSintra treated with entire contempt.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 85: (p. 92). _First purpose_, viz., to write the chronicle of\r\nthe \"Guinea Voyages,\" not to discuss philosophic problems.

Vegetius ... St. Augustine_\r\n...--Azurara here, of course, indulges in some exaggeration. Cæsar's\r\nbreach with the Senate did not take place because of his \"overpassing\r\nthe space of five years\" allowed him at first (B.C. 59) for his\r\ncommand in Gaul. In B.C. 56 the Lex Trebonia formally gave him a\r\nsecond allowance, of five years more; and he was not required to\r\ndisband his army and return from his province till B.C. 49, when the\r\nCivil War broke out. By \"Bretanha,\" or \"Brittany,\" Azurara indicates\r\nthe Duchy of Bretagne, which retained a semi-independence till 1532,\r\nwhen it was absolutely united with the crown of France. Cæsar's\r\ncampaigns against \"England\" are, of course, those of B.C. 55 and 54,\r\nagainst Germany of 55 and 53, against Spanish insurgents of 61; but he\r\ncould not by any stretch be said to have made England or Germany\r\n\"subject\" to the Roman power in the same sense as Gaul or Spain. Had\r\nhis life been prolonged twenty years, he would probably have achieved\r\nboth these unfinished conquests, as well as that of Parthia.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 87: (p. 93). _The enemy ... to them._--Azurara's reference\r\nhere is to Livy, Bk.

(See Introduction to vol.\r\nii, p. viii, x.) Especially does this expression recall the naval war of\r\n1418, when the King of Granada sent a fleet of seventy-four ships, under\r\nhis nephew, Muley Said, to aid the African Moslems in recovering Ceuta\r\nfrom the Portuguese. Prince Henry proceeded in person to the relief of\r\nthe city, and the Granada fleet, we are told, fled at the approach of\r\nthe European squadron, without venturing a battle. It is possible,\r\nhowever, though unrecorded, that the Infant was subsequently able to\r\nengage and destroy part of the Granadine squadron. Gonçalo de Sintra,\r\nfrom Azurara's words, may have been with D. Henry on this occasion.\r\n\r\nOn the reference to John Fernandez staying among the Azanegues \"only to\r\nsee the country and bring the news of it to the Infant\" (close of ch.\r\nxxix, p. 95), Santarem refers to Barros' words: \"Para particularmente\r\nver as cousas daquelle sertão que habitão os Azenegues, e dellas dar\r\nrazão ao Infante, _confiado na lingua delles que sabia_\" (like Martin\r\nFernandez, p. 57, c. xvi).]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 91: (p. 96). _The Plains thereof._--[Comparing the account in\r\nthe text with the unpublished maps already referred to, it appears that\r\nNuno Tristam, after revisiting the isles of Arguim, followed the coast\r\nto the south, passing the following places: Ilha Branca, R. de S.

The\r\n\"other land to which the first (explorers) went\" is apparently the\r\nSahara coast, from Cape Bojador to the Senegal, which Azurara here\r\nadmits to be quite a different country from \"Guinea\" proper (the land of\r\nthe Blacks). This last, after the discoveries of 1445, the Portuguese\r\nrecognised as beginning only with the cultivated or watered land to the\r\nsouth of the Sahara. The name, a very early one, whose subtle changes of\r\nmeaning are very perplexing, like the \"Burgundy\" of the Middle Ages, was\r\nprobably derived originally from the city of Jenné, in the Upper Niger\r\nValley (see Introduction to vol. ii, pp. xlv-xlix). [Here Azurara shows\r\nthat he is already beginning to recognise the geographical error of\r\nthose who gave an undue extension to the term \"Guinea.\"]--S.\r\n\r\nOn the reading at the close of this paragraph \"concerning this doubt,\"\r\nSantarem remarks: [So it stands in the MS., as verified; but it seems to\r\nus that there must be some omission of the copyist, and we propose to\r\nrestore the text thus: \"Filharom quatro daquelles _que tiveram_ o\r\natrevimento,\" etc.].]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 94: (p. 100). _Aught to the contrary._--On this passage, cf.\r\nSantarem's _Memoir on the Priority of the Portuguese Discoveries_, §\r\nIII, p. 20, etc. Paris, 1840. [_Memoria sobre a prioridade dos\r\ndescobrimentos dos Portuguezes_].]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 95: (p. 100). _Egypt ... Cape Verde._--[This proves that our\r\nnavigators were the first who gave the Cape this name. See the _Memoria\r\nsobre a prioridade_].--S. On Azurara's idea that the Senegal was near\r\nEgypt, cf. Introduction to vol. ii, pp. xii, xxx, xlii, lviii, cxxii.\r\nThis notion is, of course, bound up with the theory of the Western or\r\nNegro Nile, branching off from the Nile of Egypt. No mediæval\r\ngeographers, and scarcely any ancient, except Ptolemy, realised the size\r\nof Africa at all adequately.\r\n\r\nOn the \"rewards\" given by the Infant to Diaz, Santarem well remarks:\r\n[From this and other passages it is clear that the Infant's principal\r\nobject was discovery, and not the slave-raids on the inhabitants of\r\nAfrica in which his navigators so often indulged]. See Introduction to\r\nvol. ii, pp. v, xxiii-vi.\r\n\r\n_Cape Verde._--The turning-point of the great north-west projection of\r\nAfrica, now in French possession. It is so called, according to the\r\ngeneral view, from the rich green appearance of the headland--\"la\r\nvegetation (as the most recent French surveys describe it) qui le couvre\r\ndurant l'hivernage, et que dominent deux mornes arrondis, nommés, par\r\nles marins français, Les Deux Mamelles.\" The peninsula of Cape Verde is\r\none of the most remarkable projections of the African coast. Generally\r\nit has the form of a triangle, \"terminé par une sorte d'éperon dirigé\r\nvers le S.E., et mesure depuis le cap terminal on point des Almadies\r\njusqu' à Rufisque une longueur de 34 kilom. avec une largeur de 14\r\nkilom., sous le méridien de Rufisque, pris comme base du triangle. Sa\r\ncôte septentrionale, formant une ligne presque droite du N.N.E. au\r\nS.S.O. est creusée, près de l'extremité, de deux petites baies, dont la\r\npremière (en venant de l'E.), la baie d'Yof, est la plus considérable;\r\npuis au delà de la pointe des Almadies, qui est le Cap Vert proprement\r\ndit, la côte court au S.E. jusqu' au Cap Manuel, roche basaltique haute\r\nde 40m., puis remonte aussitôt au N. pour, par une très légère courbe,\r\npartir droit a l'E., dessinant ainsi un éperon bien accusé qui\r\nenvelloppe le Golfe de Gorée. Le corps principal de la presqu' île est\r\nbas, sablonneux et parsemé de lagunes qui s'égrènent en chapelets le\r\nlong de la côte N.; la petite péninsule terminale est au contraire\r\nrocheuse, accidentée et semble un ilot marin attaché à la côte par les\r\nlaisses de mer. Ses hautes falaises, d'une couleur sombre et rougeâtre,\r\nforment une muraille à pic contre laquelle la mer vient se briser,\r\nécumante.\" See Duarte Pacheco Pereira's _Esmeraldo_, pp. 46-49, ed. of\r\n1892. As to the island on which Dinis Diaz and his men landed near the\r\nCape, this may have been either (1) Goree, two kilometres from the\r\nmainland, and fronting Dakar on the S.E. of the peninsula; (2) The\r\nMadeleine islands, at the opening of a small inlet to the N.W. of Cape\r\nManuel; (3) The Almadia islands (\"Almadies\"), \"îlette, qui, située en\r\navant du cap terminal, est la vrai terre la plus occidentale d'Afrique,\r\nles archipels de l'Atlantique non compris;\" or (4) The isle of Yof, in\r\nthe bay of Yof, on the north side of the peninsula. The Madeleine\r\nislands were once covered with vegetation, though now desert. Here the\r\nFrench naturalist Adanson made his famous observations on the Baobab\r\ntrees, in the eighteenth century. These trees, though they have\r\ndisappeared on the islands, are still numerous on the mainland near the\r\nCape. Azurara has a good deal more to say about these islets and their\r\nbaobabs in chs. lxiii, lxxii, lxxv, pp. 193, 218, 226, etc., of this\r\nversion. The rounding of C.

It was a Roman colony, but its\r\nprosperity greatly increased under the Arab rule from A.D. 714; from\r\nthis port sailed Edrisi's Maghrarins, or Wanderers, on their voyage of\r\ndiscovery in the Western Ocean, probably in the earliest eleventh\r\ncentury. It was three times recovered and lost by the Christians: in\r\n792(-812) by Alfonso the Chaste of Castille; in 851 by Ordonho I of\r\nLeon, who held it only a few months; and in 1093(-1094) by Alfonso VI of\r\nLeon, soon after his great defeat by the Almoravides at Zalacca (1086);\r\nbut on each occasion it was quickly retaken--in 1094 by Seyr, General of\r\nYusuf ibn Tashfin, the Almorvaide. In alarm at the Moslem revival,\r\nAlfonso founded the county of Portugal in 1095, giving it in charge of\r\nCount Henry of Burgundy and his natural daughter Theresa, to hold as a\r\n\"march\" against the Moors. In 1147 Lisbon was finally recaptured by\r\nAffonso Henriques, the first King of Portugal, in alliance with a fleet\r\n(164 ships) of English, Flemish, German and French Crusaders on their\r\nway to the Holy Land (Second Crusade). At this time it was said, perhaps\r\nwith exaggeration, to contain 400,000 inhabitants; its present number is\r\nonly about 240,000 (see _Cruce-signati Anglici Epistola de Expugnatione\r\nOlisiponis_, in _Portugalliæ Monumenta Historica_, vol. i, p. 392, etc).\r\nBefore 1147 Guimaraens had been the capital of Portugal; and even down\r\nto the time of John I, Henry's father, Lisbon was not formally the seat\r\nof government, this being more often fixed at Coimbra. In the same\r\nreign, Lisbon also, as a commercial port, easily distanced all rivals\r\nwithin the kingdom, especially Oporto; and King John's erection of\r\npalaces in the city, and his successful application to the Pope for the\r\ncreation of an Archiepiscopal See (thus rivalling Braga), further\r\ncontributed to give point to Azurara's words in this paragraph about\r\n\"the most noble town in Portugal.\" On the share of the commercial\r\nclasses of Lisbon, Lagos, etc., in Henry's schemes, see Introduction to\r\nvol. ii, pp. x, xii.\r\n\r\n_Paulo Vergeryo_ is Pietro Paulo Vergerio, born at Capo d'Istria, July\r\n23, 1370, died at Buda, 1444 (1428 according to others).

Notwithstanding the unfortunate\r\nlaconism of Azurara about a fact so interesting for the history of\r\ngeography, we nevertheless see clearly by this passage that the\r\nexploration of the bays, inlets, and points of that part of the coast of\r\nAfrica was steadily pressed on; that all these points were successively\r\nexamined by our sailors; and that to these same men are due the names\r\nwhich served for the hydro-geographical nomenclature (of W.

This book,\r\nwhich exercised great influence on discovery, was not only read in the\r\nbeginning of the fifteenth century by our learned men, but we may notice\r\nthat one of the most ancient translations which exists of the same is in\r\nPortuguese, published by Valentim Fernandez, with the journey of\r\nNicholas the Venetian, etc., dedicated to the King Don Manuel, Lisbon,\r\n1502, one volume, in folio gothic, a copy of which exists in the public\r\nlibrary of Lisbon.]--S.

They were also assisted often by their brother the King of\r\nAragon. The nominal object of attack was Alvaro de Luna, favourite\r\nminister of John II during thirty-five years, a man probably\r\nunscrupulous and somewhat rapacious, but of great ability and energy. At\r\nlast John gave way, withdrew his favour, and the minister was tried and\r\nbeheaded, meeting his fate \"with the intrepidity of Strafford,\" to whom\r\nsome have compared him.\r\n\r\n_Sueiro da Costa, Alcaide of Lagos._--Cf. notes 77, 121, etc.\r\n\r\n_The King D.

[This bird is the _Buceros nasutus_ of\r\nLinnæus, the same that the French call _Calao-Tock_. Notwithstanding\r\nsome exaggeration which may be noted in the description of Azurara, it\r\nis beyond doubt that the bird of which he treats here is that which the\r\nNegroes of the Senegal call _Tock_, and which the Portuguese named\r\n_Cróes_. Latham calls it _Buceros Africanus_.\r\n\r\nBrisson made two species, Linnæus and Latham two varieties; but Buffon\r\nconsidered them as individuals of the same species, a fact which is\r\notherwise witnessed to by Sonini. Buffon says that the beak, considered\r\napart from the body, is a foot in length and of enormous size (see\r\n_Buffon_, Plate 933). The \"work\" of which Azurara speaks is not due only\r\nto the pores of the beak, but chiefly to a series of cuts or incisions,\r\nin the form of half-moons, which this bird has upon its beak. It was the\r\nfamous naturalist Aldrovandi who first gave a picture of the enormous\r\nbeak of this bird; but the oldest description of it is certainly that\r\ngiven by Azurara. It was not, therefore, Père Labat who first among\r\ntravellers saw and carefully observed this notable bird, but Lourenço\r\nDiaz and the other Portuguese, his companions in 1447: that is, at a\r\ndate almost three hundred years before Labat.

The treatise _De Regimine Principum_,\r\nwhich he wrote in 1285 for the education of that Prince, was a book of\r\nthe highest reputation (in its time), especially at the close of the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries. By the notice which is given us in\r\nthe _Chronicle of the Count D. Pedro_, and by the quotation of Azurara,\r\nwe perceive the estimation in which this book was held amongst us at the\r\nbeginning of the latter century (the fifteenth).]--S. In fact, King John\r\nI (of Portugal), in his discourse at Ceuta in 1415, recalled to his\r\nfidalgos and knights the maxims and precepts which they had read in the\r\nsame book, _De Regimine Principum_, and which he always kept in his own\r\nroom. And if we are to believe Barbosa (_Bibliotheca Lusitana_), the\r\nInfant D. Pedro had made a Portuguese translation of the same treatise;\r\nbut this learned bibliographer calls Fr. _Gil de Roma_, Fr. _Gil\r\nCorrea_. This note is not a fitting place to show whether the name of\r\n_Correa_, which Barbosa gives to that author, is or is not exact. We\r\nmust confine ourselves here to saying that King D. Edward (Duarte),\r\nquoting this book several times in chs. xxxi, xxxii, xxxvi, lii, lvi of\r\nhis _Leal Conselheiro_, calls the author, like Azurara, Fr. _Gil de\r\nRoma_. In the library at Cambrai there exists a manuscript, No. 856, of\r\nthe _De Regimine Principum_, which was finished in 1424, and\r\nconsequently at an epoch subsequent to the one of which King John I made\r\nuse. This is probably one of those used by King Edward and by Azurara.\r\nThe first printed edition was published in 1473 (see _Dictionnaire\r\nbibliographique, La Serna Santander, etc._) If, as we have just said,\r\nthe manuscript used by King John I, by King Edward, and by Azurara, is\r\none of the most ancient of which any notice survives, the Portuguese\r\ntranslation of the book of Fr. Gil de Roma by the Infant Don Pedro is\r\nalso one of the most ancient versions--if we except the French\r\ntranslation attributed to Henry of Ghent. (On this consult the Abbé\r\nLebœuf, _Dissertation sur l'histoire ecclésiastique et civile de Paris_,\r\nII, p. 41.) We think it well to give the reader this notice, in view of\r\nthe importance of Azurara's citation in this place, which shows us the\r\nstate of learning and literary culture among our people at the beginning\r\nof the fifteenth century, and at the same time the literary relations\r\nwhich existed between Portugal, France, and other countries at the end\r\nof the Middle Ages.]--S.

They set out from\r\nPortugal furnished with \"naval charts\" in which the cosmographers of\r\nthat time had designed not merely the hydrographical configuration of\r\nthe coasts of the various countries then known, but also which is more\r\ncurious, the interior of the Continents, in which they represented, by a\r\nmultitude of figures, the various sovereigns, animals, birds, woodland,\r\nand other details, both real, fantastic, and hypothetical: as the\r\ncurious reader may see in the Planisphere of Andrea Bianco of 1436,\r\npublished in the work of Formaleone, entitled _Saggio sulla nautica\r\nantica de Veneziani_, and in the other planisphere of the famous Fra\r\nMauro, published by Cardinal Zurla in his work, _Sulle antiche Mappe\r\nlavorate in Venezia_ (1818).\r\n\r\nThe idea, then, which Alvaro de Freitas had of his distance from the\r\nterrestrial Paradise, according to his own words, shows that he\r\nconsidered it to be at the extremity of the earth: that idea, we repeat,\r\nproves the influence which the geography of the Middle Ages exercised\r\nupon our sailors. As a matter of fact, that idea of the position of the\r\nterrestrial Paradise dates from the time of the _Topographia Christiana_\r\nof Cosmas Indicopleustes (see Montfaucon, _Nova Collectio Patrum_, vol.\r\nii), an idea which the journeys accomplished by land during the Middle\r\nAges fortified and reduced to a systematic opinion. On the map of Andrea\r\nBianco, the terrestrial Paradise is to be found marked in the most\r\neasterly part of Asia.\r\n\r\nAlvaro de Freitas in these words of his, alluded either to the locality\r\nin which Paradise was to be found on the ancient charts--and this, we\r\nthink, is the more probable supposition--or he referred to the\r\n_Cosmology_ of Dante, according to which Paradise was situate in the\r\nmiddle of the seas of the southern hemisphere (Dante, _Purgatorio_,\r\ncant. xxvi, ll. 100, 127.)]--S.\r\n\r\nSantarem's commentary here needs a word of supplement, which we take\r\nfrom the _Dawn of Modern Geography_, pp. 332-3.\r\n\r\n\"The position of the Garden of Eden, the habitat of the people of Gog\r\nMagog and other monstrous races, and the existence of a literal centre\r\nfor the earth-circle, were problems which exercised the patristic mind\r\nonly less than the great controversy upon the 'Spherical,'\r\n'Tabernacular,' or other shape of the world itself.\r\n\r\n\"As to the earthly Paradise, the plain word of Scripture [Genesis, ii,\r\n8; iii, 24] compelled most Theologians to place it in the Furthest East,\r\nthough a minority inclined to give a symbolic meaning to the crucial\r\nwords, 'The Lord God planted a garden _eastward_ in Eden ... and placed\r\nCherubim at the East of the Garden, to keep the way of the Tree of\r\nLife.' Augustine, here as elsewhere, shows himself inclined to\r\ncompromise, as well became one who attempted such a task as the\r\nre-statement of the whole Catholic Faith. His knowledge was too\r\nmany-sided, and his intelligence too keen, for him not to perceive the\r\nimportance of a certain liberality of temper in a creed which aspired to\r\nconquer the world, and his treatment of the question of the terrestrial\r\nParadise is a good example of his method. For himself, he holds fast to\r\nthe real existence of Eden, and the literal sense of Scripture on its\r\nposition, but he allows any one who will to give the texts at issue a\r\nsymbolical meaning (_De Civ. Dei_, XIII, ch. xxi; see also Eucherius,\r\nComm. on Genesis in the _Max. Bibl. Vet. Pat._ vi, 874, and A. Graf's\r\ninteresting essay on the _Legends of the terrestrial Paradise_, Turin,\r\n1878). To the same effect, though more doubtfully, speaks St. Isidore of\r\nSeville, who in so many ways reproduces at the end of the sixth century\r\nthe spirit and method of the Bishop of Hippo in the fifth. In one place\r\nthe Spanish Doctor repeats the traditional language about Eden, placed\r\nin the East, blessed with perpetual summer, but shut off from the\r\napproach of man by the fiery wall which reached almost to the Heaven:\r\nyet elsewhere he seems to countenance a purely figurative sense. His\r\nscepticism is expressed in the _De Differentiis_, i, 10; his\r\ntraditionalism in the _Etymologies_ or _Origins_, XIV, 3 (De Asia).\r\n\r\n\"The ordinary conclusion of the more philosophic school of Churchmen is\r\nperhaps expressed by Moses Bar-Cepha, 'Bishop of Bethraman and Guardian\r\nof sacred things in Mozal' [_i.e._, Mosul? or Nineveh], near Bagdad,\r\nabout A.D. 900 [Migne's editor of Moses, in _Pat. Græc._, cxi, pp.\r\n482-608 (1863), places him later, about A.D. 950; but Marinelli,\r\nErdkunde, 20-1, dates him about A.D. 700, doubtless with the assent of\r\nS. Günther and L. Neumann, who are responsible for the enlarged German\r\nedition of Marinelli's admirable essay. The most interesting passages of\r\nMoses' geography are in Pt. I, chs. i, ii, vii-ix, xi-xiv]. In his\r\n_Commentary on Paradise_, the ingenious prelate solves past difficulties\r\nin the spirit of Hegel himself. The terrestrial Eden had one existence\r\nunder two conditions, visible and invisible, corporeal and incorporeal,\r\nsensual and intellectual. As pertaining to this world, it existed, he\r\nconsiders, in a land which was on, but not of, the earth that we\r\ninhabit; for it lay on higher ground, it breathed a purer air, and,\r\nthough many of the saints had fixed it in the East, it was really beyond\r\nour ken.\r\n\r\n\"From Augustine onwards, through the writings of Eucherius of Lyons\r\n[_Commentary on Genesis_], of St. Basil the Great, and many others,\r\nsomething of this tendency to compromise between the literal meaning of\r\nScripture and the tacit opposition of geography, may be traced in this\r\nattempt to give reality to the earthly Paradise; and the same comes out\r\nin the conjecture of Severian of Gabala, adopted by Cosmas and by many\r\nof the traditionalists, that the rivers of Eden dived under the earth\r\nfor a long space before reappearing in our world as Nile, Euphrates,\r\nTigris and Pison (Severian of Gabala, v, 6; according to S., this\r\nsubterranean course was to prevent men from tracking their way up to\r\nParadise; cf. _Philostorgius_, III, 7-12.)\r\n\r\n\"Homeric and other pre-Christian fancies led many in the early Christian\r\nperiod still to look for Paradise in the north, among the Upper Boreans,\r\nin the south among the blameless Ethiopians, or in the west in the Isles\r\nof the Blessed, of the Hesperides, or of Fortune. Thus Capella, who was\r\nprobably a pagan survival at the beginning of the most brilliant age of\r\npatristic literature, naturally enough looks for his Elysium 'where the\r\naxis of the world is ever turning' at the northern pole [_Capella_, vi,\r\n664]; but when we find Archbishop Basil of Novgorod speculating about a\r\nParadise in the White Sea [see Karamsin's _Russian History_, as cited by\r\nMarinelli, _Erdkunde_, p. 22, note 84; and by Cardinal Zurla, _Vantaggi\r\nderivati alla Geografia_, etc., p. 44] we have a better illustration of\r\nthe undying vigour of the oldest and most poetic of physical myths,\r\nunder almost any changes of politics and religion.\"]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 138: (p. 176). _Or else upon their feathers for the rest of\r\nthe time ... other fish._--[This bird is the _Phœnicopterus_.]--S.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_: _Other birds_, etc.--[See note 128 to p. 156, on the _Buceros\r\nAfricanus_.]--S.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_: _Other fish._--[This is the _Pristis_.]--S.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 139: (p. 176). _Quite alive._--[This fish appears to be the\r\n_Remora_.]--S.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 140: (p. 176). _The two palm trees, etc._--[These palm trees\r\nexist on some old MS. maps.

The river Senegal traverses in its course nearly 350\r\nleagues from its source in the country of Fouta (Jallon) to the Atlantic\r\n(see Durand, _Voyage au Sénégal_, p. 343, and Demanet, _Nouvelle\r\nhistoire d'Afrique_, vol. i, p. 62, iv, xii, xxii-xxv, xxxiii,\r\nxlii-xliii, xlvii-xlix, lviii.)]--S. Also see Introduction to vol. ii, p.\r\nlviii, etc.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 144: (p. 180). _Mediterranean Sea, etc._--[This passage shows\r\nthat Azurara only had notice at that time of the ivory commerce which\r\nwas carried on through the ports of the Levant situated on the\r\nMediterranean, and that he had no knowledge that a like commerce was\r\ncarried on through the ports of the empire of Marocco, situated on the\r\nwest coast of Africa. \"I learnt,\" says he, \"that in the eastern part of\r\nthe Mediterranean Sea,\" etc. ... and these words of his are important,\r\nas showing that a man, otherwise well informed in matters of commerce\r\nand navigation, was not aware that the ivory trade was carried on by the\r\nwestern coast; which gives us one more proof of the priority of the\r\nPortuguese in the discovery of Guinea. Our author, then, knew the truth:\r\nfor until that epoch the trade in ivory was carried on by the Arabs by\r\nway of Egypt, the Arabs going to the coast of Zanzibar to seek for the\r\nsame, since there the better quality was to be found (see Masudi,\r\n_Notices et Extraits des MSS. de la Bibliothèque du Roi_, i, p. 15;\r\n_Ibn-al-Wardi, ibid_, ii, p. 40; _El Bakoui, ibid_, pp. 394, 401). The\r\nArab caravans also brought ivory from places in the neighbourhood of the\r\nNiger. These caravans followed the routes of the ancient Itineraries\r\n(see _Ibn-al-Wardi, Notices et Extraits des MSS._, ii, pp. 35-7, and\r\nEdrisi (Jaubert), vol. i, pp. 10-26, 105-120, 197-293). But the\r\nprincipal centre of this commerce with the interior of Africa was in the\r\nnorthern part, then already known under the name of Barbary, and in the\r\ncountries which form to-day the kingdoms of Fez and Marocco. The\r\nexpressions of Azurara about the size of the elephant are evidently\r\nexaggerated, because the species indigenous to Africa is only the second\r\nin size in the (animal) family of the Proboscidians, or \"trunked\"\r\nPachyderms. The African elephant is smaller than the Asiatic elephant,\r\nalthough the tusks of the latter are smaller than those of the former.\r\nThe details given in this part of our Chronicle are, in our opinion, so\r\nimportant for the information they give about the state of knowledge\r\namong our first discoverers, the influences of ancient tradition, and\r\nthe mediæval spirit which dominated them, that it seems opportune to\r\nindicate here to the reader what we consider most worthy of study and of\r\nreflection, in order that we may be able to estimate the state of\r\ninstruction in Portugal relative to those matters in the beginning of\r\nthe fifteenth century, seeing that up to now no (writing) work has yet\r\nappeared upon the subject from any one of our nation. Among other\r\npassages of this Chronicle we noted, on p. 156, note 128, the\r\nextraordinary exaggeration with which our seamen described the beak of\r\nthe _Buceros Africanus_, of which they said \"the mouth and maw of these\r\nbirds is so great that the leg of a man, however large it were, could go\r\ninto it as far as the knee.\" We have also seen another marvellous\r\ndescription of the beak of the _Phœnicopterus_, and finally the one\r\nwhich was inspired by the account given them of the elephant by the\r\nNegroes--an exaggeration which reminds one of the description given by a\r\nByzantine writer of the eleventh century, Michael Attaliotes, when he\r\nsaw an elephant for the first time in Constantinople (see the extract\r\nfrom the Greek MSS. of the Royal Library at Paris [Bibliothèque\r\nNationale], on p. 499 of the work of M. Berger de Xivrey: _Recits de\r\nl'antiquité sur quelques points de la fable, du merveilleux et de\r\nl'histoire naturelle_). In these exaggerated and marvellous accounts,\r\ntherefore, of birds and animals which were unknown as late as then, we\r\nfind a proof of the influence of the teratological traditions of\r\nantiquity and of the Middle Ages, in consequence of the studies which\r\nmen had previously made of the figures they saw depicted in the\r\nplanispheres and Mappemondes of their time; and also we may see in this\r\na result of the reading of Pliny, and above all of the _Treatise on\r\nMarvels_, attributed to Aristotle, \"the philosopher,\" as Azurara calls\r\nhim (see p. 12, note 19), whose authority was so great among the\r\nPortuguese of the fifteenth century that even the \"Proctors of the\r\nPeople\" (in the _Cortes_ of 1481), quoted his work on \"Politics\" (see\r\nour _Memoir on the Cortes_, ii, p. 186). We see, then, that our seamen\r\nof that period were impregnated with these traditions, and were diligent\r\nreaders of works which during the Middle Ages were given the title of\r\n_Mirabilia_, the reading of which enchanted (in that age) not only men\r\nof education, but even students, and often the people, to whom\r\necclesiastics read in public those marvellous relations, as we see,\r\namong other examples from the case of Giraldus Cambrensis, who thrice\r\nread to the people in Oxford his description of Ireland; and still more\r\nin the celebrated statutes made in 1380 by Bishop Wykeham for the\r\ncollege which he founded in the same city, in which he determined that\r\nthe chronicles of various realms should be read to the students and the\r\nmarvels of the world (_Mirabilia Mundi_); see _Sprengel_, p. 221, and\r\nWharton, _History of English Poetry_, i, p. 92. In the period at which\r\nthe statutes we mention were given to (New) College in Oxford, the\r\nrelations between Portugal and England were knit more closely than in\r\npreceding centuries. The Court of the King, D. John I, adopted most of\r\nthe English usages, and the literary communication between the two\r\npeoples was more extensive than in earlier time. The citation of the\r\nromances of chivalry made by the King to his knights, the adoption of\r\nthe French language (which was then that of the Court of England), the\r\ndevices and mottoes of which the Infants made use, prove the existence\r\nof that influence. Besides this, divers passages of King D. Duarte's\r\n_Leal Conselheiro_ show that the Infants of the House of Aviz (often)\r\ndiscussed various literary matters with the King, their father, and\r\nother literary persons, and that they even debated about the rules and\r\nregulations for properly translating classical works. We have also\r\nnoticed that King D. John I, in the discourse which he made to the\r\nfidalgos who remained at Ceuta in 1415, cited the _De Regimine\r\nPrincipum_ of Fr. Gil de Roma, bidding them recall to memory how they\r\nhad often read the same in his Privy Chamber. So then, at that epoch of\r\ndiscoveries, in which the greatest enthusiasm prevailed for the\r\nprosecution of enterprises of such moment, the reading of the _Marvels\r\nof the World_, and of the _Travels of Marco Polo_, which the Infant D.\r\nPedro brought from Venice, formed beyond doubt the delight of all those\r\nfamous men, courtiers of the Infant D. Henry, of his illustrious father,\r\nand of his brothers--courtiers, moreover, who received their education\r\nin the royal or princely palaces. The passages, then, which we read in\r\nthis Chronicle, and which we indicate to the reader, in spite of their\r\nbrevity, and of the defects which the critical study of our own time\r\nenables us to note--these passages, we say, are of the highest\r\nimportance when they are studied in harmony with other contemporary\r\ndocuments. The great men of the fifteenth century, formed in the school\r\nof the Infant Don Henry, were unquestionably possessed of great\r\nerudition for those times--an erudition and knowledge which at first\r\neludes observation, through being muffled up in the rudeness of a\r\nlanguage without polish, and which was more energetic in action than\r\nexplicit and agreeable in writing, but it is nevertheless clear that\r\nthey knew all that was known in their age.\r\n\r\nIt was this notable school, therefore, which prepared the great body of\r\ngeographical learning which we note appearing in the famous congress of\r\nPortuguese and Spanish geographers at Badajoz in 1524 and 1525: at\r\nwhich, in the discussion which took place on the demarcation of the\r\nMoluccas and on the size of the world, Aristotle was quoted along with\r\nStrabo, Eratosthenes, Macrobius, St. Ambrose, Pliny, Theodosius, Marinus\r\nof Tyre, Alfergani, and Pierre d'Ailly, etc.]--S.\r\n\r\nLong as this note is, a word must be added to it:--\r\n\r\nSantarem here covers a large part of the field of mediæval geography,\r\nbut his treatment in this place is hardly so clear or exhaustive as one\r\nmight expect from the author of the _Essai sur Cosmographie_, or the\r\ncompiler of the leading _Atlas_ of mediæval maps. As to the immediate\r\nsubject, the phrase _Mediterranean_ [_Sea_] was first used in the sense\r\nof a proper name by St. Isidore of Seville, _c._ A.D. 600 (_Origins_ or\r\n_Etymologies_, Book xiii); though its adjectival use, like the parallel\r\nexpressions \"Our [sea],\" \"the Roman [sea],\" \"the Inner [sea],\" was of\r\ncourse much earlier. As late as Solinus (_c._ A.D. 230) this last is\r\nclearly the only shade of meaning. As to the commerce of North Africa,\r\nwe must refer to the Introduction to vol. ii, pp. xxii-xxvi, xlv-lvi,\r\nlxiv. As to the mediæval _Mirabilia_, it is strange that Santarem gives\r\nno adequate reference to the great sources of these collections: Pliny's\r\n_Natural History_, and above all Solinus' _Collectanea_, principally\r\ncompiled from Pliny, Mela, and Varro, and itself reproduced (wholly or\r\npartially) in well-nigh every mediæval work of similar character,\r\ntranslated into the pictorial language of Mappemonde, such as that of\r\n_Hereford_, of _Ebstorp_, or of the _Psalter_ (Brit. Mus. _Add. MSS._\r\n28,681). On these, see _Dawn of Modern Geography_, pp. 243-273, 327-391.\r\nSantarem's remarks hardly give a sufficient idea of the systematic\r\ndomination exercised over much of mediæval thought, not only in\r\ngeography, natural history and ethnology, but in other departments also\r\nby the pseudo-science represented in these _Mirabilia_.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 145: (p. 183). _Paulus Orosius._--[Here we must note the\r\nomission of the name of Diodorus Siculus among the authors cited by\r\nAzurara, especially as he is, among all the ancient historians, the one\r\nwho has left us the most important and circumstantial account of the\r\nNile. The first Latin version of Diodorus by Poggio only appeared in\r\n1472, nineteen years after Azurara had finished this chronicle. The\r\nworks of Orosius were held in high estimation among the learned of the\r\nMiddle Ages. This writer was born at Braga in Lusitania, agreeably to\r\nthe opinion of some authors. (See _Fr. Leam de St. Thomas, bened. lusit.\r\nI_, ii, p. 308; and Baronius, an. 414.) His work, _Historiarum adversus\r\nPaganos_, which begins with the creation of the world and comes down to\r\nthe year 316 of Jesus Christ, was printed for the first time in 1471,\r\nthat is, eighteen years after Azurara had finished his Chronicle, but\r\nduring the Middle Ages copies of this work were so multiplied that even\r\nin England the book was to be found in the hands of the Anglo-Saxon\r\npeople (see Wright, _Essay on the State of Literature and Learning under\r\nthe Anglo-Saxons_, p. 39), a detail which affords one proof the more of\r\nthe literary relations between the Spanish peninsula, and the peoples\r\nand nations of the North in the first centuries of the Middle Ages.]--S.\r\nSee _Dawn of Modern Geography_, pp. 353-5.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 146: (p. 184). _Mossylon Emporion_ (_Mossille\r\nNemporyo_).--[Azurara alters the name.

But\r\nwhen it cometh out in the morning to the bank, if it findeth a boy or a\r\nman it quickly killeth him, and it is said that it swalloweth them\r\nwhole.

Hase. This city was one of the busiest of the ancient Regency of\r\nArgel.]]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 151: (p. 188). _Dog Star_ (_Canicolla_).--Here we have an\r\noriginal MS. note.--[This star, as saith the interpreter of Ovid, giveth\r\nits name to the Dog Days, which are those days which begin on July 5th\r\nand finish on September 5th. And this name came from a bitch which\r\nguarded the body of Icarus, when he was slain by the reapers, as Master\r\nJohn of England relateth. And he relateth that because that bitch\r\nguarded faithfully the body of its lord, it was numbered among the\r\nsigns; and because it was a little bitch, the Dog Days took this name of\r\ntheirs in this form, \"Canicullus\" for \"Cam,\" or \"Canicolla\" for\r\n\"Cadella.\" And because that bitch of Icarus was poisoned with the stench\r\nof its master, who lay dead and already stank, therefore did that star\r\nbecome also a poisonous one; and therefore does the sun still poison\r\nwhen it passeth through that sign, and so do the rays of the sun then\r\npoison the meats on earth. Wherefore those thirty-two days which the sun\r\ntaketh in passing through that sign, are held by physicians to be days\r\nhurtful to the health of the body.] [_John of England is John Duns\r\nScotus, Franciscan friar, called Doctor Subtilis, one of the chief\r\nphilosophers of the Middle Ages, and Professor in Oxford_ (_see Wadding,\r\nVita J. Duns Scoti, doctoris subtilis, published in 1644_).]--S.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 152: (p. 188). _Ellice and Cenosura._--Here we have another\r\nmanuscript note.--[These are the two poles, to wit, Arctic and\r\nAntarctic. And the interpreter of Ovid saith that each one of these two\r\nsigns are called _Arcom_, and that _Arcom_ is a Greek word, and\r\nsignifieth what in Latin is meant by _Ursi_, and in the Portuguese\r\nlanguage by _Ursas_; and that, besides, by each of these signs we call\r\nthe North.]]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 153: (p. 189). _So directly passeth the sun, etc._--[See\r\nStrabo, Bk. XVII, who refers to the wells without shade during the\r\nsummer solstice.]--S.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 153a: (pp. 188-9). _Bishop Achoreus._--[Azurara refers here to\r\nAchoreus, the Egyptian high priest of whom Lucan speaks in the\r\n_Pharsalia_, Canto x. The passage to which Azurara refers begins with\r\nthe following verse:--Vana fides veterum, Nilo, quod crescat in arva.\r\nComparing this chapter of Azurara with the episode of Canto x of the\r\n_Pharsalia_, we see clearly that it was from Lucan he derived the whole\r\nof his description of the Nile.]--S.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 154: (p. 191). _The marvels of the Nile._--[So great was the\r\ninfluence of the systematic geography of the ancients upon the\r\nimagination of the Portuguese of the fifteenth century, that, on\r\narriving at the Senegal, and seeing that the water was sweet very near\r\nto the mouth, and very clear, in the same manner as the Nile (_Nulli\r\nfluminum dulcior gustus est_, said Seneca), and observing the same\r\nphenomena, they did not doubt for a moment that they had discovered the\r\nNile of the Negroes. In these two chapters we see something of the vast\r\nerudition of Azurara, and at the same time something of the historical\r\nand cosmographical knowledge of our first discoverers. Moreover, we must\r\ncall the attention of the reader to a very important detail, namely,\r\nthat while Azurara shows himself imbued with the reading of the ancient\r\nauthors on these matters, in the same way as our mariners, the latter,\r\nif we study the spirit of their words, show that they had some knowledge\r\nof the system of the Arab geographers in this respect. These latter\r\napplied the same terms (as our first Portuguese explorers) to the two\r\nrivers, distinguishing the Nile of Egypt and the Nile of the Negroes.\r\nThis opinion of the Niger being an arm of the Nile was even maintained\r\nin our own day by Jackson, in his work entitled, _An Account of the\r\nEmpire of Marocco and the District of Suze_. In vol. xiv of the _Annales\r\ndes Voyages_, by Malte-Brun, 1811, and in vol. xvii of the same work, p.\r\n350, we meet with a curious analysis of this work of Jackson's on the\r\nidentity of the two rivers.]--S.\r\n\r\nWhat Azurara says here about the Nile, etc., is largely borrowed from\r\nSolinus, _Collectanea_, xxxii; Pliny, _Natural History_, v, 51-59; viii,\r\n89-97; _Pomponius Mela_, iii, viii, 9.

We transcribe this note\r\nbecause of the date and the name of the discoverer, seeing that the date\r\nagrees with what Padre Freire says in his _Life of Prince Henry_ (pp.\r\n319, 320), _i.e._, that it was in 1432 that the island of Santa Maria\r\n(Azores) was discovered by Gonçalo Velho, and not by Diego de Senill, as\r\nValsequa says. De Murr, in his dissertation on the globe of Martin de\r\nBehaim, also declares that the Azores were found in 1432. Nevertheless,\r\na great confusion as to the true date of the discovery of the Azores\r\nexists among the authorities; and if maps anterior to 1432 are compared\r\nwith what Padre Freire says (p. 323) as to the discovery of the Island\r\nof St. Michael, that the existence of this island \"accorded (as the\r\nInfant said) with his ancient maps,\" the discovery of the Azores would\r\nappear to have been effected before 1432. In fact, in the Parma map of\r\nthe fourteenth century, these islands are marked; while the Catalan Map\r\nof the Paris National Library shows the following islands in the\r\narchipelago of the Azores named in Italian:--Insula de Corvi marini\r\n(Island of Corvo); Le Conigi; San Zorzo (St. Jorge); Li Colombi; Insula\r\nde Brasil; Insule de Sante (Maria?).\r\n\r\nIn the unpublished map of the Pinelli Library, the date of which has\r\nbeen fixed as between 1380 and 1400, the said islands are marked with\r\nthe following names:--Caprana; I. de Brasil; Li Colombi; I. de la\r\nVentura; Sã Zorzi; Li Combi; I. di Corvi marini.\r\n\r\nIn the Valsequa Chart of 1439 these islands indicated by the\r\ncosmographer are marked to the number of eight, three being small ones.\r\nThe names are:--Ilha de Sperta; Guatrilla; Ylla de l'Inferno; Ylla de\r\nFrydols; Ylla de Osels (Uccello); Ylla de ...; Ylla de Corp-Marinos;\r\nConigi.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that the names of these islands, in the map of the\r\nMajorcan cosmographer, which is the most modern, are all altered, while\r\nin the Catalan map made by his compatriots, sixty-four years earlier,\r\nthe following names given by the Portuguese discoverers are found: Ilha\r\nde Corvo, de S.

Returned to the Kingdom._--[This\r\ndetail, which is not to be found in ch. xv of the _First Decade_ of\r\nBarros, where he treats of this expedition, is of the greatest\r\nimportance, because it explains the event related in the letter of\r\nAntoniotto Usus di Mare, _i.e._, Antonio da Nole, dated December 12th,\r\n1455, and found in the archives of Genoa in 1802 by Gräberg (_Annali di\r\ngeografia e di statistica_, vol. ii, p. 285), in which that traveller\r\ntells how he met in those parts with a man of his own country, whom he\r\ntook to be a member of the expedition of Vivaldi, which had set out one\r\nhundred and seventy years before, and of which nothing had been heard\r\nsince its departure, according to Italian writers. Now it cannot be\r\nadmitted that a descendant of the Genoese expeditioners of Thedisio\r\nDoria and Vivaldi would have kept his white colour if his ancestor had\r\nremained among the negroes, nor could he know the language. Therefore,\r\nAntoniotto can have seen no other white man in those parts except one of\r\nthe mariners of the Portuguese caravel of Affonso and Vallarte of which\r\nAzurara treats in the text: especially as neither the different\r\nPortuguese captains, nor Cadamosto, found in any part of the African\r\ncoast beyond Bojador a single vestige or tradition of other Europeans\r\nhaving gone there before their discovery by the Portuguese. Of the\r\nexpedition of Vivaldi no news arrived after its departure in the\r\nthirteenth century. In the time of Antoniotto there remained a tradition\r\nonly that it had set out intending to pass through the Straits of\r\nGibraltar and make an unaccustomed voyage to the West. Antoniotto was a\r\nman of good education, and we see that he knew the authors who treated\r\nof this event; but having imbibed these traditions, and knowing of the\r\nexistence of a Christian who had remained in these parts, he came to the\r\nconclusion--of course in ignorance of the fact mentioned by\r\nAzurara--that this man might be a descendant of the members of Vivaldi's\r\nexpedition, \"ex illis galeis credo Vivaldœ qui se amiserit sunt anni\r\n170.\" If this important passage of Azurara's chronicle be confronted\r\nwith the letter of Antoniotto, and both with the account of Cadamosto's\r\nsecond voyage, there remains not the least doubt that the man mentioned\r\nby Antoniotto was one of the three belonging to the caravel of Fernando\r\nAffonso and Vallarte, who had remained there in 1447, that is, eight\r\nyears before Antoniotto visited the same parts, and that he was not a\r\ndescendant of the men of Vivaldi's caravel, whose destiny had then for\r\nnearly two centuries been unknown. The passage also seems to refute the\r\nconjecture of the publisher of the said letter, and the induction of\r\nBaldelli in his _Millone_, vol. i, p. 153, etc., about the Medicean\r\nPortulano and the two maps of Africa therein, which we have analysed in\r\nour \"Memoir on the priority of the Portuguese in the Discovery of the\r\nWest Coast of Africa beyond Cape Bojador,\" where we show that these\r\nmaps, far from disproving our priority, rather confirm it.]--S.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 220: (p. 286). _The Cabo dos Ruyvos._--[Otherwise the _Angra\r\ndos Ruivos_ of ancient maps (see note 53).

To show how\r\ndeplorable it is that Azurara did not complete this Chronicle, at least\r\nas far as the death of the Infant, and include the discoveries made from\r\nthis year of 1448 to 1460, it suffices to say that from this year\r\nhenceforward all is confusion in the dates and events relative to this\r\nprosecution both in Barros and in Goes (_Chronica do principe D. João_,\r\nch. viii, which is devoted to these discoveries).\r\n\r\nBarros limits himself to citing, in the year 1449, the licence given by\r\nthe king to D.

Fernando, and only in the year 1460\r\ndoes he relate that at this time Antonio de Nolli, a Genoese by nation\r\nand a noble man, \"who owing to some troubles in his own country had come\r\nto this kingdom\" in company with Bartholemew de Nolli, his brother, and\r\nRaphael de Nolli, his nephew, obtained a licence from the Infant to go\r\nand discover the Cape Verde Islands; and that some servants of the\r\nInfant D. Fernando went on the same discovery at the same time by Prince\r\nHenry's order.\r\n\r\nSo he (Barros) leaves us in ignorance of the regular progress of our\r\ndiscoveries on the west coast of Africa from 1448, the year in which\r\nAzurara finished this Chronicle, until 1460, in which the Infant died.\r\nDamião de Goes, who pretended to relate more exactly and\r\ncircumstantially these events, leaves us in the same confusion in ch.\r\nviii of the _Chronicle of the Prince D. John_, where he treats of Prince\r\nHenry's discoveries; and, besides, he makes a great mistake regarding\r\nthe portion of coast discovered to the year 1458 (see ch. xvi, pp. 39\r\nand 40 of the work cited), an error which is refuted by what Azurara\r\nsays in ch. lxxviii of this present Chronicle.]--S.\r\n\r\nSantarem is mistaken in assuming (see note 219, to p. 286) that \"Antonio\r\nda Nole\" and Antoniotto Uso di Mare are one and the same.]\r\n\r\n[Endnote 223: (p. 289). _Albert the Great._--[Albertus Magnus, Bishop\r\nof Ratisbon, one of the most learned men of the Middle Ages.

I.\r\n\r\nDr. Sousa Viterbo, writing on Azurara in the _Revista Portugueza\r\nColonial e Maritima_ (October 20th, 1898), supplies the following fresh\r\nfacts relating to the life of the Chronicler, gleaned by him from the\r\n_Chartulary_ of the Convent of the Order of St. Bernard at Almoster,\r\nnear Santarem. On December 27th, 1465, Azurara was appointed Procurator\r\nof that famous convent by the Abbess, and in this capacity his name\r\nappears in various documents, _e.g._, of January 21st, 1471, and\r\nFebruary 22nd, 1472. The post was an important, and doubtless also a\r\nlucrative, one. He had a residence in Santarem, and no doubt lived there\r\nfor a portion of each year during the last eight years of his life. On\r\nDecember 1st, 1473, we find him in Lisbon on convent business, and on\r\nApril 2nd, 1474, his servant, one Gonçalo Pires, was named Procurator in\r\nhis stead. It seems, therefore, that the Chronicler died between the\r\nlast two dates.\r\n\r\nAzurara, though he was forbidden to marry owing to his position as a\r\nKnight of the Order of Christ, nevertheless had a son and two daughters\r\nby one Inez Gonçalves, as appears from certain Royal letters of\r\nlegitimation. Their names were:--\r\n\r\n(1) Caterina da Silveira--of the household of the Countess of\r\nLoulé--legitimated by letters of June 22nd, 1482 (_v._ Torre do Tombo\r\nLivo 2 D. João II, f. 138).\r\n\r\n(2) Gonçalo Gomez de Azurara--Squire of the household of King John\r\nII--legitimated by letters of April 14th, 1483 (_v._ Torre do Tombo,\r\nLivo I, Legitim. de Leitura Nova, f. 243).\r\n\r\n(3) Filipa Gomez--legitimated on the same day as her brother, Gonçalo\r\nGomez (same reference as No. 2).\r\n\r\nThe foregoing information was kindly supplied by General Brito Rebello,\r\nwho had discovered these letters during his researches in the Torre.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAs to the date when the _Chronicle of Guinea_ was written, _vide_ vol.\r\nii of the standard work of Dr. Gama Barros, entitled _Historia da\r\nAdministração Publica em Portugal nos Seculos XII a XV_, note 14, pp.\r\n396-9, where the question is fully discussed.\r\n\r\nAs to the history of the MS. of the same _Chronicle, vide_ the _Boletim\r\nde Bibliographia Portugueza_, vol. i, p. 41, etc. Art. by Senhor Ernesto\r\ndo Canto.\r\n\r\nIn support of the reliability of the events recorded in the same\r\n_Chronicle_, it should be remembered that Affonso de Cerveira, from\r\nwhose notes the book was compiled, was factor at Benim, and was thus\r\nenabled to obtain information at first hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRIGENDA TO VOL.

Footnotes in\r\n  the text of the book, identified with special characters in the\r\n  original, are identified here with letters A-CU.

Endnote anchors are\r\n  identified as [N1] through [N223]. Endnotes 1-112 and index page\r\n  references 1-128 refer to Volume I. All endnotes precede the index, as\r\n  in the original.\r\n\r\n  In Footnote 259, the word 'pbīs' has a macron over the letter 'p' in\r\n  the original text.\r\n\r\n  Page reference for Endnote 78 was corrected from 61 to 68. Page\r\n  reference for Endnote 100 was corrected from 110 to 111. The endnotes\r\n  contain two 75's and 153's. The second has been renumbered 75a and 153a,\r\n  respectively. Endnote anchors [N153a], [N154], [N155], and [N156],\r\n   missing in the original, have been added to the text.\r\n\r\n  Changes to text:\r\n  accent added to final 'a' ...
