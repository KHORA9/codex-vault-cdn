My thanks are with the respective\r\neditors by whose courtesy they assume this altered shape. Several\r\nwere published in a certain magazine which died young. I send cordial\r\ngreeting to its chief, and shed a few drops of ink over the nameless\r\none, loved of the gods. Fain would I believe no action of mine had\r\npower to hasten that early and untimely end. The hurrying march in\r\nwhich all must join, is so rapid, my first audience is quite out of\r\nhearing; my first inklings have faded from the memory of readers except\r\nthe one, beloved of my soul, who asks why the old Pueblo papers have\r\nnot been reprinted. Ah, what exquisite flattery!\r\n\r\nAnd just here I kiss the fair hands unseen which send such gracious\r\nmessages. Dropping flowers in my way, pansies for thoughts, rosemary\r\nfor remembrance, has made them the whiter and sweeter forevermore.\r\n\r\nThe Montezuma myth is so interwoven with the past and future of the\r\nIndians that every allusion to their history and religion must of\r\nnecessity contain the revered name. The repetition in the compositions\r\nnow collected did not appear so glaringly when they were detached.\r\nMy first impulse was to omit such passages, but second thought sends\r\nout the letters as when first offered to the public, with all their\r\nimperfections (a good many), on their head.\r\n\r\nIt would be affectation to make secret what every writer understands:\r\n(and what reader have I who is not a writer?) the pleasure with which\r\nI gather my scattered children under a permanent cover. Family\r\nresemblance is strong enough to identify them anywhere, but that is no\r\nreason why they should not appear in shape which the world will little\r\nheed nor long remember. They were written when the ancient Palace\r\nI have tried to describe, was the residence of the Governor of New\r\nMexico; and, in turning the leaves after seven years, I am touched by\r\nthe same feeling which then moved me to pipe my little songs. Again I\r\nfeel the deep solitude of the mountains, taste the all pervading alkali\r\ndust, and hear the sand-storm beating like sleet against the window\r\npanes. The best reward they brought were friendly voices answering in\r\nthe blue distance across the Sierras, and cheering me with thought\r\nthat I had won the place of welcome visitor in happy homes my feet\r\nmay never enter; that through the bitter winter my room was kept by\r\nwarm firesides under the evening lamp--there where the treasured books\r\nlie from day to day, looking like Elia’s old familiar faces. Dear to\r\nthe heart, beautiful and forever young, are the unseen friends whose\r\npresence becomes an abiding consciousness to the writer.\r\n\r\n  CRAWFORDSVILLE, Indiana, March, 1888.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE LAND OF THE PUEBLOS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. THE JOURNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am 6,000 feet nearer the sky than you are. Come to the sweet and\r\nlonely valley in the West where, free from care and toil, the weary\r\nsoul may rest; where there are neither railroads, manufactures, nor\r\ncommon schools; and, so little is expected of us in the way of public\r\nspirit, we almost venture to do as we please, and forget we should\r\nvote, and see to it that the Republic does not go to the “demnition\r\nbow-wows.”\r\n\r\nSanta Fé is precisely what the ancient Pueblos called it--“the\r\ndancing-ground of the sun.” The white rays quiver like light on\r\nrestless waters or on mirrors, and night is only a shaded day. In our\r\nsummer camp among the foothills we need no tents. It is glorious with\r\nstars of the first magnitude, that hang low in a spotless sky, free\r\nfrom fog, mist, or even dew; not so much as a mote between us and the\r\nshining floor of heaven.\r\n\r\nThe star-patterns of my coverlet are older than the figures which\r\ndelighted our grandmothers. They come out not one by one, as in our\r\nskies; but flash suddenly through the blue. Day and night make a brief\r\nparting. The short twilight closes, and lo! in the chambers of the\r\neast Orion, belted with jewels, Arcturus and his sons, and even the\r\ndim lost Pleiad, forgetting the ruins of old Troy, brightens again.\r\nWrapped in soft, furry robes, we lie on the quiet bosom of Mother Earth\r\nin sleep, dreamless and restful as the slumber of those who wake in\r\nParadise. I cannot say, with the enthusiastic land-speculator: “Ladies\r\nand gentlemen, in this highly-favored region the Moon is always at its\r\nfull.” But her face is so fair and bright I am her avowed adorer, and\r\nmany a thousand miles from\r\n\r\n  “‘a----’ the steep head of old Latmos,”\r\n\r\nshe stoops above the sleeping lover, to kiss her sweetest.\r\n\r\nOld travelers tell you the country is like Palestine; but it is like\r\nnothing outside of the Garden eastward in Eden. New Mexico is a slice\r\nof old Mexico; that is, a western section of Spain. “Who knows but you\r\nmay catch sight of some of your castles there!” Such was the invitation\r\nwhich came to me across the Rocky Mountains. I hearkened to the\r\nvoice of the “charmer, charming never so wisely,” and, “fleeing from\r\nincessant life,” started on a journey of two thousand miles. It was\r\nin the mild September, and the Mississippi Valley flamed with banners\r\ncrimson, golden, in which Autumn shrouded the faded face of the dead\r\nSummer.\r\n\r\nWe sped through Ohio, land of lovely women; past Peoria, fair Prairie\r\nCity, the smoke of whose twenty-three distilleries obscures the spires\r\nof her churches beautiful as uplifted hands at prayer; through the\r\nbridge at St. Louis, where the fairies and giants once worked together,\r\nmaking a crossing over the great Father of Waters; on we went,\r\njourneying by night and by day.\r\n\r\nOh! the horror of the chamber of torture known to the hapless victims\r\nas the sleeping-car. The gay conductor, in gorgeous uniform, told us,\r\nin an easy, off-hand manner, a man had been found dead in one of the\r\ntop berths some weeks before. I only wondered any who ventured there\r\ncame out alive. “Each in his narrow cell forever laid” went through my\r\nmind as I lay down to wakefulness and unrest in blankets filled with\r\nvermin and disease. The passengers were the same you always journey\r\nwith: the young couple, tender and warm; the old couple, tough and\r\ncool; laughing girls, in fluffy curls and blue ribbons, who found a\r\nworld of pleasure in pockets full of photographs; the good baby, that\r\nnever cried, and the bad baby, that cried at nothing; the fussy woman\r\neverybody hated, who counted her bundles every half hour, wanted the\r\nwindow up, and no sooner was it raised than she wanted it down again.\r\nThere, too, was the invalid in every train on the Pacific Road. A\r\ncollege graduate of last year, poor, ambitious, crowded four years’\r\nstudy into three, broke down, and now the constant cough tells the rest\r\nof the old tale. He was attended by a young sister, warm and rosy as he\r\nwas pallid and chill, who in the most appealing way took each one of\r\nus into her confidence, and told how Rob had picked up every step of\r\nthe road since they left Sandusky. When we entered the wide, monotonous\r\nwaste between Missouri and Colorado, how the brave girl would try to\r\ncheer the boy with riddles, stories, games, muffle him in her furs,\r\nslap his cold hands, and lay her red, ripe cheek to his, as if she were\r\nhushing a baby. In the drollest way, she resisted the blandishments\r\nof the vegetable ivory man, the stem-winder, the peanut vender, and\r\nwith tragic gesture waved off the peddler of the “Adventures of Sally\r\nMacIntire, who was Captured by the Dacotahs. A Tale of Horror and of\r\nBlood!” When the dazzling conductor illuminated the passage of the\r\ncar with his Kohinoor sleeve-buttons and evening-star breastpin, he\r\nwould stop beside the sick boy, and in a fresh, breezy way seemed to\r\nthrow out a morning atmosphere of bracing air, as well as hopeful\r\nwords. “Now,” he would say, twirling his thumb in a Pactolian chain\r\nwhich streamed across his breast and emptied into and overflowed a\r\nwatch-pocket bulgy with poorly hid treasure--“now we are coming to a\r\nplace fit to live in. When you get to Pike’s Peak, you will be 7,000\r\nfeet above the level of the sea. It’s like breathing champagne. You’ll\r\ncome up like a cork; keep house in a snug cottage; go home in the\r\nSpring so fat you can hardly see out of your eyes.” Vain words. The\r\npoor boy knew, and we knew, he was fast nearing the awful shadow which\r\nevery man born of woman must enter alone. The mighty hand was on him.\r\nHe was going to Colorado Springs only to die. We parted at La Junta,\r\ncrowding the windows, gayly waving good-byes. I can never forget my\r\nlast sight of the sweet sister, with her outspread shawl sheltering him\r\nfrom the crisp wind, which blew from every direction at once, as I have\r\nseen a mother-bird flutter round her helpless nestlings. The good baby\r\nheld up its sooty, chubby hand saying, “ta, ta,” as long as they were\r\nin sight, and the mothers smiled tearfully to each other when a rough\r\nminer from the Black Hills said, softly, as if talking to himself: “I\r\nreckon, if that young woman’s dress was unbuttoned, wings would fly\r\nout.”\r\n\r\nFive hundred miles across plains level as the sea, treeless, waterless,\r\nafter leaving the Arkansas River. Part of our road lay along the old\r\nCalifornia trail, the weary, weary way the first gold-seekers trod,\r\nmaking but twenty miles a day. Under ceaseless sunshine, against\r\npitiless wind, it is not strange that years afterward their march was\r\nreadily tracked by graves, not always inviolate from the prairie wolf.\r\nThe stiff buffalo-grass rose behind the first explorers, and even\r\nhorses and cattle left no trail. They took their course by the sun,\r\nshooting an arrow before them; before reaching the first arrow they\r\nshot another; and in this manner marched the entire route up to the\r\nplace where they found water and encamped.\r\n\r\nOccasionally we saw a herdsman’s hut standing in the level expanse,\r\nlonely as a lighthouse; nothing else in the blank and dreary desert\r\nbut the railroad track, straight as a rule, narrow as a thread, and\r\nits attendant telegraph, precious in our sight as a string of Lothair\r\npearls. Not a stick or stone in a hundred miles. Only the sky, and the\r\nearth, clothed with low grass-like moss, the stiff sage-brush, and a\r\nvile trailing cactus, which crawls over the ground like hairy green\r\nsnakes. To be left in such a spot would be like seeing the ship sail\r\noff leaving us afloat in fathomless and unknown seas.\r\n\r\nAfter a day seeming long as many a month has, the fine pure air of\r\nColorado touched with cooling balm our tired, dusty faces; and against\r\nthe loveliest sunset sky, in a heavenly radiance, all amber and\r\ncarmine, the Spanish peaks majestically saluted us.\r\n\r\nOh! the glory of that sight! Two lone summits, remote, inaccessible;\r\nthe snowy, the far-off mountains of poetry and picture. Take all the\r\nsongs the immortal singers have sung in praise of Alpine heights and\r\nlay them at their feet; it yet would be an offering unworthy their\r\nsurpassing loveliness. Now we lost sight of them; now they came again;\r\nthen vanished in the evening dusk, dropped down from Heaven like the\r\nBabylonish curtain of purple and gold which veiled the Holy of Holies\r\nfrom profane eyes. Fairest of earthly shows that have blest my waking\r\nvision, they stand alone in memory, not to fade from it till all fades.\r\n\r\nAt Trinidad we left the luxury of steam, and came down to the\r\nterritorial conveyance. Think, dear reader, of two days and a night on\r\na buckboard--an instrument of torture deadly as was ever used in the\r\ndays of Torquemada, and had anything its equal been resorted to then\r\nthere would have been few heretics.\r\n\r\nIt is a low-wheeled affair floored with slats, the springs under\r\nthe seats so weak that at the least jolt they smite together with\r\na horrible blow, which is the more emphatic when over-loaded, as\r\nwhen we crossed the line which bounds “the most desirable of all the\r\nTerritories.” Our night was without a stop, except to change horses.\r\nJolt, jolt; bang, bang; cold to the marrow, though huddled under\r\nbuffalo robes and heavy blankets. How welcome the warmth of the sun\r\non our stiffened limbs; and the early breeze, sweet and fresh as airs\r\nacross Eden when the evening and the morning were the first day! It\r\nhas a sustaining quality which almost serves for food and sleep. There\r\njourneyed with us in the white moonshine spectres, shadowy, ghost-like.\r\nNow the sun comes up, we see they are kingly mountains, wrapped in\r\nrobes of royal purple and wearing crowns of gold. The atmosphere is so\r\nrefined and clear, they appear close beside us; but the driver says\r\nthey are forty miles away. Noon comes on, hot and still, with a desert\r\nscorch. We journey over a road surprisingly free of stones; across a\r\nblank and colorless plain, bounded by mountain-walls which stand grim\r\nand stark like bastions of stone. Another night and another long day.\r\nThe driver is not on his high horse now. He has no funny stories of\r\nthe grizzly and cinnamon bear, which he assures us can climb trees,\r\nsticking their claws in the bark, easily as the telegraph-mender,\r\nwith clamps on his feet, goes up the pole. Along the roadside stretch\r\nbeautiful park-like intervales, studded with dwarf pines, that appear\r\nplanted at regular distances.\r\n\r\nWill the day never end? I have no voice nor spirit, and begin to\r\nthink the wayside crosses mark graves of travelers, murdered, not by\r\nassassins, but by the buckboard; and feebly clutch my fellow-sufferer,\r\nand shake about in a limp, distracted way, pitying myself, as though\r\nI were somebody else. I can hold out no longer. But wake up! Wake up!\r\nThis is the home-stretch. The horses know it and dash across a little\r\nbrook which they tell me is the Rio Santa Fé.\r\n\r\nPleasant the sound of running water; tender the light of the evening on\r\nthe mountains which encircle the ancient capital of the Pueblos. As we\r\napproach, it is invested with indescribable romance, the poetic glamor\r\nwhich hovers about all places to us foreign, new, and strange. We go\r\nthrough a straggling suburb of low, dark adobe houses. How comfortless\r\nthey look! Two Mexicans are jabbering and gesticulating, evidently\r\nin a quarrel. Swarthy women, with dismal old black shawls over their\r\nheads, sit in the porches. I hear the “Maiden’s Prayer” thumped on a\r\npoor piano. How foolish in me to think that I could escape the sound\r\nof that feeble petition! Lights stream through narrow windows, sunk in\r\ndeep casements, and a childish voice, strangely at variance with the\r\nwords, is singing “Silver Threads among the Gold” to the twanging of a\r\nweak guitar. Softly the convent-bells are ringing a gracious welcome to\r\nthe worn-out traveler. The narrow streets are scarcely wide enough for\r\ntwo wagons to pass. The mud walls are high and dark. We reach the open\r\nPlaza. Long one-story adobe houses front it on every side. And this is\r\nthe historic city! Older than our government, older than the Spanish\r\nConquest, it looks older than the hills surrounding it, and worn-out\r\nbesides. “_El Fonda!_” shouts the driver, as we stop before the hotel.\r\nA voice, foreign yet familiar, gayly answers: “_Ah! Senora, a los\r\npieds de usted._” At last, at last, I am not of this time nor of this\r\ncontinent; but away, away across the sea, in the land of dreams and\r\nvisions, “renowned, romantic Spain.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. HISTORIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nI used to think Fernandina was the sleepiest place in the world, but\r\nthat was before I had seen Santa Fé. The drowsy old town, lying in a\r\nsandy valley inclosed on three sides by mountain walls, is built of\r\nadobes laid in one-story houses, and resembles an extensive brick-yard,\r\nwith scattered sunburnt kilns ready for the fire. The approach in\r\nmidwinter, when snow, deep on the mountains, rests in ragged patches on\r\nthe red soil of New Mexico, is to the last degree disheartening to the\r\ntraveler entering narrow streets which appear mere lanes. Yet, dirty\r\nand unkept, swarming with hungry dogs, it has the charm of foreign\r\nflavor, and, like San Antonio, retains some portion of the grace which\r\nlong lingers about, if indeed it ever forsakes, the spot where Spain\r\nhas held rule for centuries, and the soft syllables of the Spanish\r\ntongue are yet heard.\r\n\r\nIt was a primeval stronghold before the Spanish conquest, and a town of\r\nsome importance to the white race when Pennsylvania was a wilderness,\r\nand the first Dutch governor was slowly drilling the Knickerbocker\r\nancestry in the difficult evolution of marching round the town pump.\r\nOnce the capital and centre of the Pueblo kingdom, it is rich in\r\nhistoric interest, and the archives of the Territory, kept, or rather\r\nneglected, in the leaky old Palacio del Gobernador, where I write, hold\r\ntreasure well worth the seeking of student and antiquary. The building\r\nitself has a history full of pathos and stirring incident as the\r\nancient fort of St. Augustine, and is older than that venerable pile.\r\nIt had been the palace of the Pueblos immemorially before the holy\r\nname Santa Fé was given in baptism of blood by the Spanish conquerors;\r\npalace of the Mexicans after they broke away from the crown; and palace\r\never since its occupation by El Gringo. In the stormy scenes of the\r\nseventeenth century it withstood several sieges; was repeatedly lost\r\nand won, as the white man or the red held the victory. Who shall say\r\nhow many and how dark the crimes hidden within these dreary earthen\r\nwalls?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: El Palacio, Santa Fé. (From Pencil Sketch by Gen.\r\nWallace.)]\r\n\r\nHawthorne, in a strain of tender gayety, laments the lack of the\r\npoetic element in our dear native land, where there is no shadow, no\r\nmystery, no antiquity, no picturesque and gloomy wrong, nor anything\r\nbut commonplace prosperity in broad and simple daylight. Here is\r\nevery requisite of romance,--the enchantment of distance, the charm\r\nof the unknown,--and, in shadowy mists of more than three hundred\r\nyears, imagination may flower out in fancies rich and strange. Many a\r\npicturesque and gloomy wrong is recorded in mouldy chronicles, of the\r\nfireside tragedies enacted when a peaceful, simple people were driven\r\nfrom their homes by the Spaniard, made ferocious by his greed of gold\r\nand conquest; and the cross was planted, and sweet hymns to Mary and\r\nher Son were chanted on hearths slippery with the blood of men guilty\r\nonly of the sin of defending them.\r\n\r\nFour hundred years ago the Pueblo Indians were freeholders of the vast\r\nunmapped domain lying between the Rio Pecos and the Gila, and their\r\nseparate communities, dense and self-supporting, were dotted over the\r\nfertile valleys of Utah and Colorado, and stretched as far south as\r\nChihuahua, Mexico. Bounded by rigid conservatism as a wall, in all\r\nthese ages they have undergone slight change by contact with the white\r\nrace, and are yet a peculiar people, distinct from the other aboriginal\r\ntribes of this continent as the Jews are from the other races in\r\nChristendom. The story of these least known citizens of the United\r\nStates takes us back to the days of Charles V. and the “spacious times\r\nof great Elizabeth.”\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1528 an exploring expedition set out, by order of\r\nthe king of Spain, from San Domingo to invade Florida, a name then\r\nloosely given to the wide area between the bay of Fernandina and the\r\nMississippi River. It was commanded by Pamfilo de Narvaez; the same it\r\nwill be remembered, who had been sent by the jealous governor of Cuba\r\nto capture Cortez, and who, after having declared him an outlaw, was\r\nhimself easily defeated. His troops deserted to the victorious banner,\r\nand when brought before the man he had promised to arrest, Narvaez\r\nsaid, “Esteem yourself fortunate, Señor Cortez, that you have taken me\r\nprisoner.” The conqueror replied, with proud humility and with truth,\r\n“It is the least of the things I have done in Mexico.”\r\n\r\nThis anecdote illustrates the haughty and defiant spirit of the general\r\nwho sailed for battle gayly as to a regatta, with a fleet of five\r\nvessels and about six hundred men, of whom eighty were mounted. He\r\ncarried blood-hounds to track natives, chains and branding-irons for\r\ncaptives; was clothed with full powers to kill, burn, plunder, enslave;\r\nand was appointed governor over all the country he might reduce to\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nThe leader and his command perished by shipwreck and disasters, all\r\nbut four. Among the survivors was one Alvar Nuñez Cabeça de Vaca,\r\ntreasurer for the king and high sheriff, who is described in the\r\nannals of that period as having the most beautiful and noble figure\r\nof the conquerors of the New World; and in the best days of chivalry\r\nhis valor on the battle-field, his resolution in danger, his constancy\r\nand resignation in hardship, won for him the proud title “Illustrious\r\nWarrior.” Ten years he, with three companions, rambled to and fro\r\nbetween the Atlantic and Gulf of California. The plain statement of\r\ntheir privations and miseries must of necessity be filled with marvels;\r\nthat of Cabeça de Vaca, duly attested and sworn to, is weakened by wild\r\nexaggerations, and the _Relacion_ of this Western Ulysses is touched\r\nwith high colorings and embellished with fantastic fables equal to the\r\nmoving accidents by flood and field of the heroic king of Ithaca. He\r\ntells of famishing with hunger till they devoured dogs with relish;\r\nof marching “without water and without way” among savages of giant\r\nstature, dressed in robes, “with wrought ties of lion-skin, making a\r\nbrave show,--the women dressed in wool that grows on trees;”[1] of\r\nmeeting cyclopean tribes, who had the sight of but one eye; of being\r\nenslaved and going naked--“as we were unaccustomed to being so, twice\r\na year we cast our skin, like serpents;” of his escape, and, after\r\nliving six years with friendly Indians, of being again made captive\r\nby barbarians, who amused themselves by pulling out his beard and\r\nbeating him cruelly; of living on the strange fruits of mezquit and\r\nprickly-pear; of mosquitoes, whose bite made men appear to have “the\r\nplagues of holy Lazarus;” of herds of wonderful cows, with hair an\r\ninch thick, frizzled and resembling wool, roaming over boundless plains.\r\n\r\nHolding his course northwest, he came to a people “with fixed\r\nhabitations of great size, made of earth, along a river which runs\r\nbetween two ridges;” and here we have the earliest record of Pueblo\r\nor Town Indians, so named as distinguished from nomads or hunting\r\ntribes, dwelling in lodges of buffalo-skin and boughs. It is difficult\r\nto trace his course along the nameless rivers of Texas; he must have\r\nascended the Red River and then struck across to the Canadian, which\r\nruns for miles through a deep cañon, in which are yet seen extensive\r\nruins of ancient cities. Undoubtedly he was then among the Pueblo\r\nIndians, in the northwestern part of New Mexico. He described them as\r\nan intelligent race, with fine persons, possessing great strength,\r\nand gave them the name “Cow Nation,” because of the immense number\r\nof buffaloes killed in their country and along the river for fifty\r\nleagues. The region was very populous, and throughout were signs of a\r\nbetter civilization. The women were better treated and better clad;\r\n“they had shawls of cotton;[2] their dress was a skirt of cotton that\r\ncame to the knees, and skirts of dressed deer-skins to the ground,\r\nopened in front and fastened with leather straps. They washed their\r\nclothes with a certain soapy root which cleansed them well.[3] They\r\nalso wore shoes.” This is the first account of the natives of that\r\ncountry wearing covering on their feet--doubtless the moccasins still\r\nworn by them.\r\n\r\nThe gentle savages hailed the white men as children of the sun, and,\r\nin adoration, brought their blind to have their eyes opened, their\r\nsick that, by the laying on of hands, they might be healed. Mothers\r\nbrought little children for blessings, and many humbly sought but to\r\ntouch their garments, believing virtue would pass out of them. The\r\nrude hospitality was freely accepted; the sons of the morning feasted\r\non venison, pumpkins, maize bread, the fruit of the prickly-pear; and,\r\nrefreshed by the banquet, made their worshipers understand that they\r\ntoo were suffering with a disease of the heart, which nothing but gold\r\nand precious stones could cure. The Pueblos were then as now a race\r\ndepending on agriculture rather than the chase, and were in distress\r\nbecause rain had not fallen in two years, and all the corn they had\r\nplanted had been eaten by moles. They were afraid to plant again until\r\nit rained, lest they should lose the little seed left, and begged the\r\nfair gods “to tell the sky to rain;” which the celestial visitants\r\nobligingly did, and, in answer to the prayers of the red men, breathed\r\non their buffalo skins, and bestowed a farewell blessing upon them at\r\nparting.\r\n\r\nThey again pushed westward in search of riches, always further on,\r\ncrossed a portion of the _Llano Estacado_, or Staked Plain, and\r\ntraveled “for a hundred leagues through a thickly settled country, with\r\ntowns of earth abounding in maize and beans.” Hares were very numerous.\r\nWhen one was started the Indians would attack him with clubs, driving\r\nhim from one to another till he was killed or captured.[4]\r\n\r\nEverywhere they found order, thrift, friendly welcome. The Indians gave\r\nCabeça de Vaca fine turquoises, buffalo robes, or, as he calls them,\r\n“blankets of cow skins,” and fine emeralds made into arrow-heads, very\r\nprecious, held sacred, and used only in dances and celebrations. They\r\nsaid these jewels had been received in exchange for bunches of plumes\r\nand the bright feathers of parrots; they were brought a long distance\r\nfrom lofty mountains in the north, where were crowded cities of very\r\nlarge and strong houses.[5]\r\n\r\nIt appears from his _Relacion_ that Cabeça de Vaca passed over the\r\nentire territory of New Mexico, went down the Gila to a point near its\r\nmouth, struck across to the river San Miguel, thence to Culiacan, and\r\nso on to Mexico, where the four wanderers, worn by hardship, gaunt and\r\nspectral by famine, were received with distinction by the Viceroy,\r\nMendoza, and Cortez, Marquis of the Valley.\r\n\r\nThe venturesome hero was summoned to Valladolid to appear before\r\nCharles V., and hastened to lay at the feet of his imperial master the\r\ngathered spoil which cost ten years of life: the hide of a bison, a\r\nfew valueless stones resembling emerald, and a handful of worthless\r\nturquoises.\r\n\r\nBefore he set sail for Spain, Cabeça de Vaca told his marvelous story\r\nto sympathetic and eager listeners; and, besides, airy rumors had\r\nalready floated down the valley of Anahuac of a land toward the north\r\nwhere seven high-walled cities, “the Seven Cities of Cibola,” were\r\ndefended by impregnable outworks. They were least among the provinces,\r\nwhere were countless greater cities of houses built with numerous\r\nstories, “lighted by jewels,” and containing treasure stored away in\r\nsecret rooms, rich as Atahualpa’s ransom. Various rovers gave accounts\r\nof natives clad in curious raiment, richer and softer than Utrecht\r\nvelvet, who wore priceless gems, whole ropes and chains of turquoises,\r\nin ignorance of their actual value. One of these stragglers, an\r\nIndian, reported that the houses “of many lofts” were made of lime\r\nand stone; he had seen them “with these eyes.” The gates and smaller\r\npillars of the principal ones were of turquoise, and their princes were\r\nserved by beautiful girls, whom they enslaved; and their spear-heads,\r\ndrinking-cups, and ornamental vessels were of pure gold. There were\r\nwondrous tales, too, of opal mountains,[6] lifted high in an atmosphere\r\nof such amazing clearness that they could be seen at vast distances; of\r\nvalleys glittering with garnets and beryls; of clear streams of water\r\nflowing over silver sands; of strange flora; of the shaggy buffalo;\r\nof the fearful serpent with castanets in its tail;[7] of a bird like\r\nthe peacock;[8] and a _Llano_, broad as the great desert of Africa,\r\nover which hovered a mirage more dazzling than the Fata Morgana, more\r\ndelusive than the spectre of the Brocken.\r\n\r\nA friar named Niza, with one of the companions of Cabeça de Vaca, went\r\nout “to explore the country” three hundred leagues away, to a city they\r\ncalled Cibola,[9] clearly identified as old Zuni, on a river of the\r\nsame name, one hundred and eighty miles northwest of Santa Fé. This\r\nflighty reporter testified to Mendoza that he had been in the cities of\r\nCibola, and had seen the turquoise columns and soft, feathery cloaks\r\nof those who dwelt in king’s palaces. Their houses were made of stone,\r\nseveral stories high with flat roofs, arranged in good order; they\r\npossessed many emeralds and precious stones, but valued turquoises\r\nabove all others. They had vessels of gold and silver more abundant\r\nthan in Peru.\r\n\r\n“Following as the Holy Ghost did lead,” he ascended a mountain, from\r\nwhich he surveyed the promised land with a speculator’s eyes; then,\r\nwith the help of friendly Indians, he raised a heap of stones, set up\r\na cross, the symbol of taking possession, and under the text, “The\r\nheathen are given as an inheritance,” named the province “El Nuevo\r\nRegno de San Francisco” (the New Kingdom of St. Francis); and from that\r\nday to this San Francisco has been the patron saint of New Mexico.\r\n\r\nIn our prosaic age of doubt and question it is hard to understand the\r\nfaith with which sane men trusted these bold falsehoods. They were mad\r\nwith the lust of gold and passion for adventure; and valiant cavaliers\r\nwho had won renown in the battles of the Moor among the mountains of\r\nAndalusia, and had seen the silver cross of Ferdinand raised above the\r\nred towers of the Alhambra, now turned their brave swords against the\r\nfeeble natives of the New World. Less than half a century had gone by\r\nsince the discovery of America; the conquests of Pizarro and Cortez\r\nwere fresh in men’s minds, and an expedition containing the enchanting\r\nquality called hazard was soon organized. Illustrious noblemen sold\r\ntheir vineyards and mortgaged their estates to fit the adventurers out,\r\nassured they would never need more gold than they would bring back from\r\nthe true El Dorado. The young men saw visions; the old men dreamed\r\ndreams; volunteers flocked to the familiar standards; and an army was\r\nsoon ready “to discover and subdue to the crown of Spain the Seven\r\nCities of Cibola.”\r\n\r\nFrancisco Vasquez Coronado, who left a lovely young wife and great\r\nwealth to lead the romantic enterprise, was proclaimed captain-general;\r\nand Castenada, historian of the campaign, writes, “I doubt whether\r\nthere has ever been collected in the Indies so brilliant a troop.” The\r\nwhole force numbered fifteen hundred men and one thousand horses; sheep\r\nand cows were driven along to supply the new settlements in fairyland.\r\nThe army mustered in Compostella, under no shadow darker than the wavy\r\nfolds of the royal banner, and one fair spring morning, the day after\r\nEaster, 1540, marched out in armor burnished high, with roll of drums,\r\nthe joyful appeal of bugles, and all the pomp and circumstance the old\r\nSpaniard loved so well. The proud cavaliers, “very gallant in silk\r\nupon silk,” kindled with enthusiasm, and answered with loud shouts the\r\ncheers of the people who thronged the house-tops. The viceroy led the\r\narmy two days on the march, exhorted the soldiers to obedience and\r\ndiscipline, and returned to await reports.\r\n\r\nWhen the mind is prepared for wonders the wonderful is sure to appear,\r\nand time fails to tell what prodigies the high-born gentlemen beheld:\r\nthe Indians of monstrous size, so tall the tallest Spaniard could reach\r\nno higher than their breasts; a unicorn, which escaped their chase.\r\n“His horn, found in a deep ravine, was a fathom and a half in length;\r\nthe base was thick as one’s thigh; it resembled in shape a goat’s horn,\r\nand was a curious thing.” They were the first white men who looked down\r\nthe gloomy cañon of the Colorado to the black rushing river, walled by\r\nsheer precipices fifteen hundred feet high. Two men tried to descend\r\nits steep sides. They climbed down perhaps a quarter of the way, when\r\nthey were stopped by a rock which seemed from above no greater than\r\na man, but which in reality was higher than the top of the cathedral\r\ntower at Seville. They passed places where “the earth trembled like a\r\ndrum, and ashes boiled in a manner truly infernal;” watched magnetic\r\nstones roll together of their own accord; and suffered under a storm\r\nof hail-stones, “large as porringers,” which indented their helmets,\r\nwounded the men, broke their dishes, and covered the ground to the\r\ndepth of a foot and a half with ice-balls; and the wind raised the\r\nhorses off their feet, and dashed them against the sides of the ravine.\r\nThey fought many tribes of Indians, and were relieved to meet none who\r\nwere “man-eaters and none anthropophagi.”[10]\r\n\r\nThe route of Coronado is traced with tolerable clearness up the\r\nColorado to the Gila; up the Gila to the _Casa Grande_, called\r\nChichiticale, or Red House, standing more than three centuries ago,\r\nas it does now, in a mezquit jungle on the edge of the desert; “and,”\r\nwrites his secretary, “our general was above all distressed at\r\nfinding this Chichiticale, of which so much had been said, dwindled\r\ndown to one mud house, in ruins and roofless, but which seemed to\r\nhave been fortified.” With true Spanish philosophy, he covered his\r\ndisappointment, and gave the place an alluring mystery, with the idea\r\nthat “this house, built of red earth, was the work of a civilized\r\npeople come from a distance.” And into the distance he went, through\r\nArizona, the lower border of Colorado, and turned southeast to where\r\nSanta Fé now stands, then the central stronghold of the Pueblo empire.\r\nThey fought and marched, destroyed villages, leveled the poor temples\r\nof the heathen, planted the cross, and sang thanksgiving hymns over\r\ninnumerable souls to be saved,--all very well as far as it went; but\r\nthe mud-built pueblos yielded neither gold nor precious metals.\r\n\r\nAcoma, fifty miles east of Zuni, is thus accurately described by\r\nCastenada, under the name of Acuco: “It is a very strong place, built\r\nupon a rock very high and on three sides perpendicular. The inhabitants\r\nare great brigands, and much dreaded by all the province. The only\r\nmeans of reaching the top is by ascending a staircase cut in solid\r\nrock: the first flight of steps numbered two hundred, which could only\r\nbe ascended with difficulty; when a second flight of one hundred more\r\nfollowed, narrower and more difficult than the first. When surmounted,\r\nthere remained about twelve more at the top, which could only be\r\nascended by putting the hands and feet in holes cut in the rock. There\r\nwas space on this summit to store a great quantity of provisions, and\r\nto build large cisterns.”[11]\r\n\r\nThe chiefs told Coronado that their towns were older than the memory\r\nof seven generations. They were all built on the same plan, in blocks\r\nshaped like a parallelogram, and were from two to four stories high,\r\nwith terraces receding from the outside. The lower story, without\r\nopenings, was entered from above by ladders, which were pulled up,\r\nand secured them against Indian warfare. There was no interior\r\ncommunication between the stories; the ascent outside was made from\r\none terrace to another. The houses were of sun-dried bricks, and for\r\nplaster they used a mixture of ashes, earth, and coal. Every village\r\nhad from one to seven _estufas_, built partly underground, walled\r\nover the top with flat roofs, and used for political and religious\r\npurposes. As in certain other mystic lodges which date back to the days\r\nof King Solomon, women were not admitted. All matters of importance\r\nwere there discussed; there the consecrated fires were kept burning,\r\nand were never allowed to go out. The women wore on their shoulders a\r\nsort of mantle, which they fastened round the neck, passing it under\r\nthe right arm, and skirts of cotton. “They also,” writes Castenada,\r\n“make garments of skins very well dressed, and trick off the hair\r\nbehind the ears in the shape of a wheel, which resembles the handle\r\nof a cup.” They wore pearls on their heads and necklaces of shells.\r\nEverywhere were plenty of glazed pottery and vases of curious form and\r\nworkmanship, reminding the Spaniards of the jars of Guadarrama in old\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nThe gallant freebooters traversed deserts, swam rivers, scaled\r\nmountains, in a three years’ chase after visionary splendors; but the\r\nopal valley and the vanishing cities, with their sunny turquoise gates\r\nand jeweled colonnades, faded into the common light of day. Though\r\nthe adventurers failed in their mocking “quest of great and exceeding\r\nriches,” they explored and added to the Spanish crown, by right of\r\noccupation, an area twelve times as large as the State of Ohio.\r\n\r\nI dwell on these earliest records because it is the habit of travelers\r\nvisiting ruins, which in the dry, dewless air of New Mexico are almost\r\nimperishable, to ascribe them to an extinct race and lost civilization,\r\nsuperior to any now extant here. They muse over Aztec glories faded,\r\nand temples fallen, in the spirit of the immortal antiquary, who saw\r\nin a ditch “slightly marked” a Roman wall, surrounding the stately and\r\ncrowded prætorium, with its all-conquering standards bearing the great\r\nname of Cæsar.\r\n\r\nThese edifices are not mysterious except to revered fancies, and\r\ntheir tenants were not divers nations, but clans, tribes of one blood,\r\nand civilized only as compared with the savages surrounding them--the\r\ntameless Apache, the brutish Ute, the degraded Navajo, against whose\r\nattacks they devised their system of defense, so highly extolled by\r\nrambling Bohemians, and threw up “impregnable works,” which are only\r\nlow embankments wide enough for the posting of sentinels.\r\n\r\nI have been through many abandoned and inhabited pueblos, examining\r\nthem with the utmost care, and can discover no essential in which they\r\ndiffer from one another or from those of Castenada’s time. In each\r\none there is the terraced wall; the vault-like lower story, used as\r\ngranary, without openings, and entered from above by ladders; the small\r\nupper rooms, with tiny windows of selenite and mica; the same round\r\noven; the glazed pottery; the circular estufa with its undying fire;\r\n_acequias_ for irrigation, not built like Roman aqueducts, but mere\r\nditches and canals; and from the sameness of the remains I infer that\r\nno important facts are to reward the search of dreaming pilgrim or\r\npatient student.\r\n\r\nEach village had its peculiar dialect, and chose its own governor. The\r\nreport of the Rev. John Menaul, of the Laguna Mission, March 1, 1879,\r\ngives an abstract of their laws, identical with those framed by “the\r\ncouncil of old men,” the dusky senators described by Castenada; and\r\nthen, as now, the governor’s orders were proclaimed from the top of the\r\nestufa, every morning, by the town-crier.\r\n\r\nAfter the invasion of Coronado, New Granada, as it was then called, was\r\ncrossed by padres, vagabonds of various grades, and later by armies\r\nof subjugation. The same tale is told: how the peace-loving Pueblo\r\nwas found, as his descendants are, cultivating fields along the rivers\r\nor near some unfailing spring, living in community houses wonderfully\r\nalike, and keeping alive the sacred fire under laws which like those of\r\nthe Medes and Persians, change not. The fair strangers were at first\r\ngraciously welcomed and feasted; but the red men soon learned that the\r\nchildren of the sun, before whom they knelt, whose march-worn feet they\r\nkissed in adoration, were come merely for robbery and spoil. The Indian\r\nwas condemned not only to give up his scanty possessions, and leave the\r\nwarm precincts of the cheerful day to work in dismal mines, but he must\r\nput out the holy flame, and worship the God of his pitiless master.\r\nConversion was ever a main object of the zealous _conquistador_, and\r\nVargas, one of the early Spanish governors, applying for troops to\r\ncarry on the crusade, writes--and his record still stands--“You might\r\nas well try convert Jews without the Inquisition as Indians without\r\nsoldiers.” The first revolt (1640), while Arguello was governor of the\r\nprovince, grew out of the whipping and hanging of forty Pueblos, who\r\nrefused to give up their own religion and accept the holy Catholic\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nThe Pueblos constantly rebelled, and escaped to the lair of the\r\nmountain lion, the den of the grizzly and cinnamon bear, the hole of\r\nthe fox and coyote. They sought shelter from the avarice and bigotry\r\nof their Christian persecutors in the steeps of distant cañons, and\r\nfound where to lay their head in the hollows of inaccessible rocks; and\r\nthis brings us to the cliff houses, latterly the subject of confused\r\nexaggeration and absurd conjecture.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the first foreign invasions were by far the\r\nmost merciless, and it appears reasonable that hunted natives made a\r\nhiding-place in these fastnesses; that there they allied themselves\r\nwith the Navajo, who, from a remote period, had dwelt in the\r\nnorthern plains, beat back the enemy, and, as Spanish rigor relaxed,\r\nreturned from exile to their fields and adobe houses as before.\r\nMud walls had been proof against arrow, spear, and battle-axe, but\r\ncould not withstand the finer arms of the fairer race. The cave or\r\ncliff-dwellings of Utah, Colorado, and Arizona are exact copies of\r\nthe community tenements of Southern and Moquis pueblos, varying with\r\nsituation and quality of material used. The architecture of these human\r\nnests and eyries--in some places seven hundred and a thousand feet\r\nfrom the bottom of the cañon--has been magnified out of all bounds.\r\nEager explorers, hurried away by imagination, have even compared the\r\ncivilization which produced them with\r\n\r\n  “The glory that was Greece,\r\n   The grandeur that was Rome.”\r\n\r\nI found nothing in them to warrant such flights of fancy, and, like\r\nall castles in air, they lessen wofully at a near view. Those along\r\nthe Rio Mancos and Du Chelly are mere pigeon-holes in the sides of\r\ncañons, roofed by projecting ledges of rock. The walls, six or eight\r\ninches thick, are built of flat brook-stones hacked on the edge with\r\nstone hatchets, or rather hammers, to square angles; in some cases\r\nthey are laid in mud mortar and finished with mud plaster, troweled,\r\nPueblo fashion, with the bare hand. Certainly, mortal never fled to\r\nthese high perches from choice, or failed to desert them as soon as the\r\ndanger passed. Whether we believe that the hunters were Christian or\r\nheathen, we must admit that this was a last refuge for the hunted, made\r\ndesperate by terror. The masonry is smoothed, so none but the sharpest\r\neyes can notice the difference between it and the rock itself, and in\r\nno instance is there trace of chimney or fire-place.[12] The whole idea\r\nof the work is concealment.\r\n\r\nOne might well ask, with sight-seeing Niza strolling through fabled\r\nCibola, “if the men of that country had wings by which to reach these\r\nhigh lofts.” Unfortunately for the romancers, “they showed him a\r\nwell-made ladder, and said they ascended by this means.” And well-made\r\nladders the cliff dwellers had--steps cut in the living rock of the\r\nmountain, and scaling-ladders stout and light.\r\n\r\nThe solitary watch-towers along the McElmo, Colorado, and wide-spread\r\nrelics of cities in the cañon of the Hovenweep Utah, near the old\r\nSpanish trail through the mountains from Santa Fé to Salt Lake, are\r\nbuilt on the same general plan, and divided into snug cells and\r\npeep-holes, averaging six by eight feet. Perpendiculars are regarded;\r\nstones dressed to uniform size are laid in mud mortar. A distinguishing\r\nfeature is in the round corners, one at least appearing in nearly every\r\nlittle house. “Most peculiar, however, is the dressing of the walls\r\nof the upper and lower front rooms, both being plastered with a thin\r\nlayer of firm adobe cement of about the eighth of an inch in thickness,\r\nand colored a deep maroon red, with a dingy white band eight inches\r\nin breadth running around floor, sides, and ceiling”[13]--ideas of\r\nimprovements probably derived from their enlightened conquerors. There\r\nis a story that a hatchet found there would cut cold steel, but I have\r\nnot been able to learn its origin or trace it to any reliable authority.\r\n\r\nIn every room entered was the unfailing mark of the Pueblo--pottery\r\nglazed and streaked, as manufactured by no other tribe of Indians and\r\ninvariably reduced to fragments, either through superstition or to\r\nprevent its falling into the hands of the enemy. No entire vase or jar\r\nhas appeared among the masses strewed from one end to the other of\r\ntheir ancient dominion. I have picked up quantities of this pottery\r\nnear old towns, where it covers the ground like broken pavement, but\r\nhave not seen one piece four inches square.\r\n\r\nAfter their first experiments the Spaniards saw the policy of\r\nconciliating a confederation so numerous and powerful as the Pueblos,\r\nand as early as the time of Philip II. mountains, pastures, and waters\r\nwere declared common to both races; ordinances were issued granting\r\nthem lands for agriculture, but the title in no instance was of higher\r\ngrade than possession. The fee-simple remained in the crown of Spain,\r\nthen in the government of Mexico, by virtue of her independence, and\r\nunder the treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo, February 2, 1848, passed to the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nWhen General Kearney took possession of the country the Pueblos were\r\namong the first to give allegiance to our government, and, as allies,\r\nwere invaluable in chasing the barbarous tribes--their old enemies,\r\nwhom they tracked with the keen scent and swiftness of blood-hounds.\r\nThey now number not less than twenty thousand peaceful, contented\r\ncitizens, entitled to confidence and respect, and by decree of the\r\nsupreme court (1871) they became legal voters.\r\n\r\nWithout written language, or so much as the lowest form of\r\npicture-writing, they usually speak a little Spanish, enough for\r\npurposes of trade, and, less stolid and unbending than the nomads,\r\nin manner are extremely gentle and friendly. Their quaint primitive\r\ncustoms, curious myths, and legends afford rich material for the poet,\r\nand their antiquities open an endless field to the delving archæologist.\r\n\r\nNominally Catholics, they are really only baptized heathen. A race\r\nso rigidly conservative must by very nature be true to the ancient\r\nceremonials, and their religion is not the least attractive study\r\noffered by this interesting people. Even the dress of the women (oh,\r\nhappy women!) has remained unchanged,--the same to-day as described by\r\nCoronado’s secretary in 1541.\r\n\r\nThere passes my window at this moment a young Indian girl from Tesuque,\r\na village eight miles north of Santa Fé. Like the beloved one of the\r\nCanticles, she is dark but comely, and without saddle or bridle sits\r\nastride her little _burro_ in cool defiance of city prejudice. Always\r\ngayly dressed, with ready nod and a quick smile, showing the whitest\r\nteeth, we call her Bright Alfarata, in memory of the sweet singer\r\nof the blue Juniata; though the interpreter says her true name is\r\n_Poy-ye_, the Rising Moon. Neither of us understands a word of the\r\nother’s language, so I beckon to her. She springs to the ground with\r\nthe supple grace of an antelope, and comes to me, holding out a thin,\r\nslender hand, the tint of Florentine bronze, seats herself on the\r\nwindow-sill, and in the shade of the _portal_ we converse in what young\r\nlovers are pleased to call eloquent silence. Her donkey will not stray,\r\nbut lingers patiently about, like the lamb he resembles in face and\r\ntemper, and nibbles the scant grass which fringes the acequia. I think\r\nhis mistress must be a lady of high degree, perhaps the _caçique’s_\r\ndaughter, she wears such a holiday air, unusual with Indian women, and\r\nis so richly adorned with beads of strung periwinkles. She wears loose\r\nmoccasins, “shoes of silence,” which cannot hide the delicate and\r\nshapely outline of her feet, leggins of deer-skin, a skirt reaching\r\nbelow the knee, and a cotton chemise. Her head has no covering but\r\nglossy jet-black hair, newly washed with _amolé_, banged in front, and\r\n“is tricked off behind the ears in the shape of a wheel which resembles\r\nthe handle of a cup”--the distinguishing fashion of maidenhood now\r\nas it was more than three hundred years ago. Tied by a scarlet cord\r\nacross her forehead is a pendant of opaline shell, the lining of a\r\nmussel shell, doubtless the very ornament called precious pearl and\r\nopal which dazzled the eyes and stirred the covetous hearts of the\r\nfirst _conquistadores_. Our Pueblo belle wraps about her drapery such\r\nas Castenada’s maiden never dreamed of,--a flowing mantle which has\r\nfollowed the march of progress. Thrown across the left shoulder and\r\ndrawn under her bare and beautiful right arm is a handsome red blanket,\r\nwith the letters U. S. woven in the centre.\r\n\r\nOne secret cause of the Pueblos’ ready adherence to our government is\r\ntheir tradition that,\r\n\r\n                  “Far away\r\n  In the eternal yesterday.”\r\n\r\nMontezuma, the brother and equal of God, built the sacred city Pecos,\r\nmarked the lines of its fortifications, and with his own royal hand\r\nkindled the sacred fire in the _estufa_. Close beside it he planted a\r\ntree upside down, with the prophecy that, if his children kept alive\r\nthe flame till his tree fell, a pale nation, speaking an unknown\r\ntongue, should come from the pleasant country where the sun rises, and\r\nfree them from Spanish rule. He promised the chosen ones that he would\r\nreturn in fullness of time, and then went to the glorious rest prepared\r\nfor him in his tabernacle the sun.\r\n\r\nI have seen the remains of that forsaken city, once a mighty fortress,\r\nnow desolate with the desolation of Zion. Thorns have come up in her\r\npalaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof. It is a\r\nhabitation for dragons and a court for owls. The site, admirably chosen\r\nfor defense, is on a promontory, somewhat in the shape of a foot, which\r\ngave a broad lookout to the sentry. In the valley below, the waters of\r\nthe river Pecos flow softly, and park-like intervals fill the spaces\r\ntoward foot-hills which skirt the everlasting mountain walls. The\r\nadobe houses have crumbled to the dust of which they were made, and\r\nheaped among their ruins are large blocks of stone, oblong and square,\r\nweighing a ton or more, and showing signs of being once laid in mortar.\r\n\r\nThe outline of the immense _estufa_, forty feet in diameter, is plainly\r\nvisible, sunken in the earth and paved with stone; but all trace of the\r\nupper story of the council chamber has vanished. On the _mesa_ there is\r\nnot a tree, not even the dwarf cedar, which strikes its roots in sand,\r\nand lives almost without water or dew; but, strange to see, across the\r\ncentre of the _estufa_ lies the trunk of a large pine, several feet in\r\ncircumference--an astonishing growth in that sterile soil. The Indian\r\nresting in its fragrant shade, listening to the never-ceasing west wind\r\nswaying slender leaves that answered to its touch like harp-strings\r\nto the harper’s hand, clothed the stately evergreen with loving\r\nsuperstition, which hovers round it even in death; for this is the\r\nMontezuma tree, planted when the world was young.\r\n\r\nWhen Pecos was deserted the people went out as Israel from Egypt,\r\nleaving not a hoof behind. They destroyed everything that could be\r\nof service to an enemy, and the ground is yet covered with scraps of\r\nbroken pottery marked with their peculiar tracery.\r\n\r\nThe Oriental Gheber built his temple over deep subterranean fires, and\r\nthe steady light shone on after altar and shrine were abandoned and\r\nforgotten; but the fire-worshipers on the stony _mesa_ at Pecos had a\r\nvery different work. The only fuel at hand was cedar from the adjacent\r\nhills; and, shut in the dark inclosure, filled with pitchy smoke and\r\nsuffocating gas, it is not strange that death sometimes relieved the\r\nwatch. When the chiefs, who had seen the kingly friend of the red man,\r\ngrew old, and the hour came for their departure to their home in the\r\nsun, they charged the young men to guard the treasure hidden in the\r\nsilent chamber. Another generation came and went; prophecy and promise\r\nwere handed down from age to age, and the Pueblo sentinel, true to his\r\nunwritten creed, guarded the consecrated place beside the miracle-tree,\r\ndaily climbed the lonely watch-tower, looked toward the sun-rising,\r\nand listened for the coming of the beautiful feet of them that on the\r\nmountain-top bring glad tidings. Their days of persecution ended, they\r\nno longer ate their bread with tears, and a century of prosperous\r\ncontent went by. Then they were shorn of their strength, and their\r\npower was broken by inroads of warring nations. The cunning Navajo\r\nharried their fields and trampled the ripening maize; the thieving and\r\ntameless Comanche carried off their wives, and sold their children into\r\nslavery, and their numbers were so reduced that the warriors were too\r\nfeeble to attempt a rescue. Hardly enough survived to minister in the\r\nholy place; hope wavered, and the mighty name of Montezuma was but a\r\ndim, proud memory.\r\n\r\nYet the devoted watchmen dreamed of a day when he should descend with\r\nthe sunlight--crowned, plumed, and anointed--to fill the dingy _estufa_\r\nwith a glory like that when the Divine Presence shook the mercy-seat\r\nbetween the cherubim. The eternal fire flickered, smouldered in embers,\r\nbut endured through all change and chance, like a potent will; it was\r\nthe visible shadow of the Invisible One, whose name it is death to\r\nutter. Sent by his servant and lawgiver, his word was sure; they would\r\nrest on the promise till sun and earth should die.\r\n\r\nAt last, at last, constant faith and patient vigil had their reward. On\r\nthe wings of the wind across the snowy Sierras was heard a sound like\r\nthe rushing of many waters--the loud steps of the promised deliverer.\r\nEast, toward Santo Domingo, southward from the Rio Grande, there\r\nentered Santa Fé an army of men with faces whiter than the conquered\r\nMexican. Their strange, harsh language was heard in the streets; a\r\nforeign flag bearing the colors of the morning, white and red, blue\r\nand gold, was unrolled above the crumbling palace of the Pueblos. The\r\nprophecy was fulfilled, and at noon that day the magic tree at Pecos\r\nfell to the ground.\r\n\r\nAfter the American occupation, the remnant of the tribe in Pecos\r\njoined that of Jemez, which speaks the same language. It is said the\r\n_caçique_, or governor, carried with him the Montezuma fire, and in\r\na new _estufa_, sixty miles from the one hallowed by his gracious\r\npresence, the faithful are awaiting the second advent of the beloved\r\nprophet, priest, and king, who is to come in glory and establish his\r\nthrone forever and ever.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The hanging moss. _Tillandsia usneoides._\r\n\r\n[2] Made of the fibre of the maguey, or American aloe.\r\n\r\n[3] The root of the _Yucca aloifolia_, a spongy, fibrous mass,\r\ncontaining gelatinous and alkaline matter. It grows in most parts of\r\nNew Mexico, where it is called _amolé_, and is used instead of soap for\r\nwashing.\r\n\r\n[4] This is still a favorite sport among the Pueblos. They sally out\r\nfrom their villages, mounted on _burros_, to the prairies, where\r\nrabbits are started from their coverts, when the horsemen chase them;\r\nusing clubs, which they throw with great precision, like the boomerang\r\nof the savage Australian. In this way they catch a great many. It is\r\nvery exciting, and is carried on amid yells and much good-natured\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n[5] In the Navajo country between the San Juan and Colorado Chiquito,\r\nare found quantities of beautiful garnets and a green stone resembling\r\nemerald.

It is wholly\r\nfree from the vice of the commonplace, being tinged with the warm\r\nglow which precedes the morning light of history. Wild as the Homeric\r\nlegends, it serves like them to point the way.\r\n\r\n[11] It is the same to-day that it was in 1540,--a place of great\r\nstrength; and the _Mesa_ can be ascended only by the artificial road.\r\nThe houses on top are of adobes, one and two stories in height.

LAWS AND CUSTOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number of Pueblo or Town Indians of New Mexico and Arizona has\r\nbeen variously estimated at from sixteen to twenty-five thousand. The\r\ndumb secrecy of the red race makes it difficult for the census-taker\r\nto reach correct figures among them. They have a suspicion that the\r\nSagamore with medicine-book, ink and pen has come to question them\r\nwith wicked intent; that numbering the people means plotting for\r\nmischief; and they secrete their children and give false figures, so\r\nit is impossible to arrive at an accurate estimate of their numbers.\r\nIn the cultured East there is a popular superstition that the noble\r\naboriginal soul disdains artifice, and is open as sunlight to the\r\nsweet influences of truth and straightforward testimony:--an illusion\r\nrising from the misty enchantments of distance. Come among them,\r\nand you will soon learn to make allowance for every assertion; and\r\nas for vanity and self-love I have never seen any equal that of the\r\nchildren of nature debased by contact with the white men. They cannot\r\nbe instructed, because they know everything, nor surprised, because\r\ntheir fathers had all wisdom before you were born. Show them the\r\nmost curious and beautiful article you possess; they survey it with\r\nstolid composure as an object long familiar. I once saw an officer,\r\nthinking to floor a _Caçique_, unfold the wonders of a telescope to\r\nthe untutored mind, and explain how, by bending his beady eyes to a\r\ncertain point the child of the sun might see the spots on his father;\r\nwhen the blanketed philosopher coolly observed that he had often\r\nlooked through such machines. We then gave it up. Like the Chinese\r\nthey so closely resemble, nothing can be named which they did not have\r\nages ago; and having so long possessed all knowledge, they steadily\r\nresist your efforts to show them their ignorance. They think themselves\r\nthe envy of the civilized world. Among such a people one soon learns\r\nto repress assumption of superiority or effort to impress the calm\r\nlistener with your grammatical sentences. The poverty of their language\r\nis indescribable. Where there is no writing, and of course no standard\r\nof comparison, the change in the sound of words goes on rapidly, while\r\nthe great principle of utterance or general grammar remains. Mere\r\nchange of accent under such circumstances produces a dialect. It is\r\nnot easy to catch the lawless Indian tongues; those of the wandering\r\ntribes are peculiarly unmanageable, and it is wise to have a common\r\nmeeting-place in the little Spanish which they pick up. They have\r\nno preposition, article, conjunction, or relative pronoun, and to a\r\ngreat degree lack the mood and tense of the verb. A dual and negative\r\nform runs throughout the languages, and sentences are often composed,\r\nnot of the words which the objects mentioned separately mean, but of\r\nwords meaning certain things in certain connections. The disheartened\r\nstudent, groping in the dark for signs and rules, and finding none,\r\nis glad to turn from his bewildering labor to the interpreter who has\r\nlearned by ear.\r\n\r\nThe Pueblos have nineteen different villages in New Mexico, numbering\r\nin all nearly ten thousand souls. The towns are evidently smaller than\r\nthey were formerly, as is plainly proved by ruins of houses throughout\r\ntheir ancient dominion, and old worn foot-paths, abandoned or almost\r\nuntrodden, that lead from town to town, beaten by centuries of\r\nwayfaring in some period whereof there is no history.\r\n\r\nThey are slowly decreasing in numbers, and, says a gentleman resident\r\namong them ten years, “why they should gradually disappear like the\r\nnomadic and warlike tribes, is a question not easily solved except by\r\nthe hypothesis that their time has come. Their great failing is lack of\r\nself-assertion. Conquered and brought down from freedom and peace two\r\ncenturies ago, to a condition of servitude and an enforced religion,\r\nthe power of ‘The Fair God’ has rested heavily on them ever since.”\r\n\r\nThere are singular characteristics among these Pueblos. Each village\r\nis a separate domain or clan, self-supporting, entirely independent\r\nof the government of the other Pueblos and the great world in the\r\ncountry across the Sierras where the sun rises. There is no common bond\r\nof union among them, and so little intercourse have they with each\r\nother that their language, everywhere subject to great mutations, is\r\nso altered that they communicate when needful through the Spanish, of\r\nwhich most Indian men understand enough to make their wishes known.\r\nThere are three dialects among the tribes of New Mexico, and three or\r\nfour more among those of Arizona. Few Indians understand more than one.\r\nIn the seven Moqui villages of Arizona, within a radius of ten miles,\r\nthree distinct tongues are spoken. The inhabitants are identical in\r\nblood, manners, laws and mode of life. For centuries they have been\r\nisolated from the rest of the world, and it is almost incomprehensible\r\nto the restless, aggressive, fairer race how these Pueblos refuse any\r\ninter-communication. Tegua and the two adjacent towns are separated\r\nby a few miles from Mooshahneh and another pair. Oraybe is not a\r\ngreat distance from both. Each mud-walled community-house has so\r\nlittle interest in the others that there is neither trade nor visiting\r\nbetween them. One might think the women, at least, would sometimes\r\npick up their knitting and go out for a little social enjoyment and\r\nthe friendly gossip so dear to the feminine heart, or that crafty\r\nhunters, tracking deer and coyote, would follow the abandoned trails\r\nof the forefathers winding among the towns, but they do not; they are\r\ntoo sluggish and dead, and it is the rarest thing for a man to marry\r\noutside of his own little tribe. I have heard the assertion that so\r\nfar from dying out before the march of civilization the increase goes\r\nsteadily on--not in all the tribes, but in the aggregate. It is not\r\ntrue. The prehistoric ruins plainly prove that in long forgotten days\r\nthe Pueblos were numerous and powerful; a nation and a company of\r\nnations. The Rio Grande valley was then dotted with clusters of towns,\r\nand Santa Fé was the centre of four confederacies, and among the most\r\npopulous of cities. Down the little Rio on both banks are remains\r\nof villages, heaps of crumbling adobes, and the unfailing sign of\r\nfleeing tribes, scraps of broken pottery, glazed and painted with their\r\npeculiar markings. Thinking of the bold theories about population, one\r\nnaturally asks, Who took the census when De Soto went wandering up and\r\ndown the everglades of Florida seeking the alluring, ever vanishing\r\nFountain of Youth.\r\n\r\nEvery Pueblo, or village, has its own officers and government\r\nindependent of all the others, and exactly the same and according to\r\nthe ancient customs. First there is the _Caçique_, chief officer of\r\nchurch and state, priest of Montezuma, and director of all temporal\r\naffairs of the pueblo. It is not known how the _Caçique_ was originally\r\ninstalled in his office, he alone having power to appoint his\r\nsuccessor--which duty is among the first he performs after succeeding\r\nto his office; nor can the most inquiring mind of the most energetic\r\nnewspaper correspondent discover the origin of their judicial system.\r\n\r\nThe _Caçique_, aided by three _Principales_, selected by himself,\r\nappoints the Governor “and all the officers.” The appointments are\r\ncommunicated to the council of _Principales_, and then proclaimed to\r\nthe people. No matter how weak and shrunken in numbers the tribe, it\r\nstill has its full corps of officers, all sons of Montezuma, though\r\nevidently many generations removed from the conquering chiefs who\r\nreveled in the jeweled halls of their illustrious ancestor.\r\n\r\nThe Governor is appointed by the _Caçique_ for one year, and is the\r\nexecutive officer of the town. He is chief in power and nothing can\r\nbe done without the order of the Governor, especially in those things\r\nrelating to the political government. The position is purely honorary\r\nas regards salary, and the honors do not cease with the office, for\r\nthe dignified place of _Principal_ is awaiting him at the close of his\r\nterm, and there is no anti-third term rule to prohibit his holding the\r\nplace many times during his life.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the Governor succeeds to his office he repairs\r\nto Santa Fé and seeks the agent for the Pueblo Indians to receive\r\nconfirmation. This is an empty ceremony, the agent being without the\r\nauthority to object or remove, but it is followed in obedience to\r\nprecedent and custom, and there is no harm in humoring the ambition of\r\nthe gentle wards of the government. On such days of lofty state the\r\nhappy fellow, in paint and solemn dignity, brings a silver-headed cane,\r\nand hands it to the agent, who returns it to the Governor, and the\r\naugust inaugural ceremony is ended. Under the Mexican rule, it is said,\r\nthe new incumbent knelt before the Governor of the Territory, and was\r\nconfirmed by a process of laying on of hands, and some simple formula\r\nof Spanish sentences.\r\n\r\nThe _Principales_, or ex-Governors, compose a council of wise men, and\r\nare the constitutional advisers of the Governor, deciding important\r\nquestions by their vote.\r\n\r\nThe _Alguacil_, or Sheriff, carries out the orders of the Governor, and\r\nis overseer and director of the public works.\r\n\r\nThe _Fiscal Mayor_ attends to the ordinary religious ceremonies.\r\n\r\nThe _Capitan de la Guerre_, captain of war, with his under-captains and\r\nlieutenants, has very light duty to perform in these piping times of\r\npeace. He is head of the ancient customs, dances, and whatever pertains\r\nto the moral life of the people. The several priests acting under him\r\norder the dances, and enforce special obedience of those dedicated to\r\nany particular god or ancient order. Each of the officers has a number\r\nof lieutenants under him.\r\n\r\nThis is a gallant array of officials for such a tribe as Tesuque,\r\nnumbering less than a hundred, or Pojouque, in all twenty-six, or Zia\r\nfifty-eight haughty aborigines. I have not been able to find if they\r\nhave badges and insignia of office, but I do know they strut along the\r\nstreets of Santa Fé as though they were at the head of tribes like\r\nthe sands of the sea-shore, like the leaves of the forest, the stars\r\nof heaven, according to the swelling sentences of the proud speeches\r\nwhich our early friend J. F. Cooper gave his heroes. The uniform worn\r\nis usually buckskin pants, fringed leggins, moccasins, and, in lordly\r\ndefiance of the prejudices of civilization, with untaught grace the\r\n_Caçique_ wears his pink calico shirt outside his pantaloons. It\r\nbreezily flutters in the eternal west wind, but the sun is his father,\r\nthe earth is his mother; he heeds not that cold breath though it blow\r\nfrom heights of perpetual snow. The tenderness of romance invests the\r\ndegraded descendant of the noble Aztecan, and wherever he turns, the\r\nshades of Cooper and Prescott attend him.\r\n\r\nAs a class the Pueblos are the most industrious, useful, and orderly\r\npeople on the frontier; at peace with each other and the surrounding\r\nMexicans. They raise large crops of grain, ploughing with a crooked\r\nstick, the oriental implement in the days of Moses, and frequently\r\nstirring the soil with a rude hoe, for where irrigation is necessary\r\nconstant work is required. Threshing is done by herds of goats or\r\nflocks of sheep, the floor being a plastered mud ring enclosed in\r\nupright poles. The wheat is piled up in the centre, the animals are\r\nturned into the pen, and driven round and round until the grain is all\r\ntrampled out. Then the mass is thrown into the air; the wind carries\r\naway the broken straw, leaving the grain mixed with quantities of\r\ngravel, sand, etc. It is washed before being ground, but the flour is\r\nalways more or less gritty. They raise corn, beans, vegetables, and\r\ngrapes, the latter rich and sweet, and own large herds of cattle and\r\nsheep. They possess in common much of the best land of the Territory\r\nwhich, for cultivation, is parceled out to the various families who\r\nraise their own crops and take their produce to market.\r\n\r\nPaupers and drones are unknown among them, because all are obliged to\r\nwork and make contribution to the possessions of the community to which\r\nthey belong.\r\n\r\nAt Taos nearly four hundred persons live in two buildings over three\r\nhundred feet in length, and about a hundred and fifty feet wide at the\r\nbase. They are on opposite sides of a little creek, said to have been\r\nconnected in ancient times by a bridge, a grim and threatening fortress\r\nof savage strength, many times attacked by the Spaniards but never\r\ncaptured. If there are family feuds and quarrels, the outside world has\r\nno knowledge of them; men, women, and children, mothers-in-law and all,\r\nlive together in absolute harmony. On the highest story a sentinel is\r\nposted. One might think this ancient custom could be dispensed with in\r\nthe generation of peace since the American occupation, but they hold\r\nthe wise Napoleonic idea, if you would have peace be always ready for\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIVING PUEBLO. (NEW MEXICO).]\r\n\r\nEach Pueblo contains from one to seven _estufas_, used as a\r\ncouncil-house and a place of worship, where they carry on their\r\nheathen rites and ceremonies, and deliberate on the public weal; a\r\nconsecrated spot to which women are not admitted; a senate-chamber\r\nwhere long debates on public affairs are maintained, and the business\r\nof the tribe transacted by the council of wise men, cunning prophets,\r\nand able warriors, whose duty it is to manage the internal affairs\r\nof the town. The Governor assembles his constitutional advisers in\r\nthe lodge, where matters are discussed and decided by the majority.\r\nOne of their wise regulations is a secret police whose duty is to\r\nprevent vice and disorder, and report in the under-ground _estufa_ the\r\nconduct of suspected persons. The dingy little “temples of sin,” as the\r\nold Catholics call them, are hung round with dim and fading legends\r\nand shadowy superstitions. Their worshipers have not the slightest\r\napproach to music in the horrible noises they make there--a kind of\r\nsledge-hammer beating on rude drums and blowing of ear-splitting\r\nwhistles--nor have they any idea of rhythm or poetry. No correct\r\ntradition is kept without one of these arts, and in the absence of\r\nall recorded law a perfect devotion to custom carries their poor\r\ncivilization forward as it was in the beginning. It keeps the Pueblos\r\na separate and distinct people, bounded by a dead wall of conservatism\r\nto this day. Says the Rev. Dr. Menaul of the Laguna mission, “Religion\r\nenters into everything they do, _i. e._ everything is done according to\r\nancient custom. The new-born babe comes upon the stage of life under\r\nits auspices, is fed and clothed, or not clothed, according to custom.\r\nIt is hushed to sleep with a custom-song, gets custom-medicine, and\r\ngrows up in the very bosom of religious custom. The father plants and\r\nreaps his fields, makes his moccasins, knits his stockings, carries the\r\nbaby on his back, in fact does all that he does in strict conformity\r\nto custom. The mother grinds the meal, makes the bread, wears her\r\nclothing, and keeps her house, makes her water-pots, and paints them\r\nwith religious symbols, according to custom. The whole inner and outer\r\nlife of the Indian is one of perfect devotion to religious custom, or\r\nobedience to his faith.” And this adoration of the past makes them the\r\nmost difficult of all people to be reached by outside influence, a\r\nrigid unbending adherence to old time observances sets their faces as\r\na flint against everything new and foreign, and our mission-work seems\r\ndashing against a dead wall. Nothing is subject to change among them\r\nexcept language; they have the most shifting forms of human speech, so\r\nthe students tell us, and desiring no improvement or alteration, how\r\ncan we influence them by religious teaching? How plant new ideas where\r\nthere is no room to receive them?\r\n\r\nOf all the millions of native Americans who have perished under the\r\nwithering influence of European civilization, there is not a single\r\ninstance on record of a tribe or nation having been reclaimed,\r\necclesiastically or otherwise, by artifice and argument. Individual\r\nsavages have been educated with a fair degree of success, but there is\r\nno tribe that is not savage. The Koran says, “Every child is born into\r\nthe religion of nature; its parents make it a Jew, a Christian, or a\r\nMagian.” These North American Indians are more alike than the children\r\nof Japhet. Our culture is a failure offered to them, unless one can be\r\ndetached from his tribe; return him to his people, and he goes back\r\nto the dances and incantations, the mystic lodges and time-hallowed\r\nceremonials of the fathers. It seems as difficult to train him as to\r\nteach the birds of the air a new note, or the beaver another mode of\r\nmaking his dam; we cannot re-create the head or the heart of the red\r\nman. He wants his freedom, his tribe, his ancient customs; he desires\r\nno change, and his sense of spiritual things is instinctive like a\r\nchild’s.\r\n\r\nThis rigidity of organism makes sad waste of religious teaching.\r\nCatholic and Protestant have been alike unsuccessful. Jonathan Edwards\r\nfailed as signally as the missionaries of the Territories who have\r\nlived among them for generations. There is a scarce perceptible\r\nprogress. The young men have no wish to be better or different from\r\ntheir fathers, and they are slightly changed (can we say for the\r\nbetter?) since Columbus gave to Spain the gift of the New World.\r\n\r\nHardest of all is it to teach the Indian how divine a woman may\r\nbe made, and it is argued that women are best fitted to reach the\r\nburden-bearing sisters of the red race. The Quakers succeeded no\r\nbetter than the Puritans, and St. Mary of the Conception was not more\r\ndiscouraged than the self-sacrificing bride from New England, who comes\r\nto the land of sand and thorn to teach the dusky mothers how to sing\r\nand sew, and broken in health and spirit, returns to her native hills\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Zuñi War Club, Dance Ornaments, etc.]\r\n\r\nIn winter the main industry of the Pueblos is practicing for the\r\npublic dances, a training pursued with anxious care by the priesthood\r\ndedicated to the duty, as by the ambitious danseuse who fain would copy\r\nthe famous winged sylphide leap attained by the lithe limbs and flying\r\nfeet of Taglioni.\r\n\r\nTheir Te Deum after victories, and most sacred and beloved rite, is the\r\n_cachina_ dance, which they celebrate at certain seasons of the year\r\nwith great rejoicings. I have never seen it but am told it is full of\r\ncontortions and fantastic leaps, ending in a jerky trot, unlike polka\r\nor mazurka, and still less resembling the gliding, sinuous action of\r\nthe world-old Teutonic waltz, most delicate modulation of graceful\r\nmovement vouchsafed the children of men.\r\n\r\nWhen the Spaniards first conquered this country and imposed their\r\nreligion on the natives, the idolatrous _cachina_ was prohibited\r\non pain of death. History records the natives held it so cruel a\r\ndeprivation, that the interdict was one of the main causes of the\r\ngreat rebellion of 1680, when Don Antonio de Oterim was Governor and\r\nCaptain General of Nueva Espagna. Many of the night dances are held\r\nin the deepest secrecy; of these the uninitiated may not speak; but\r\nother holy days commemorative of abundant harvests are high festivals\r\nto which citizens of Santa Fé are cordially invited. You-pel-lay, or\r\nthe green corn dance, is a national thanksgiving involving the deepest\r\ninterest and mighty preparation, besides fasting and _purification_.\r\nSome weeks before the carnival we accepted an invitation from the\r\n_Caçique_ of Santo Domingo, where unusual pomp and circumstance attend\r\nthe celebration of this harvest home.\r\n\r\nIt was in the mild September. Our ambulance was roomy and comfortable,\r\nthe mules were fresh, the party just such as the dear reader loves,\r\nthe breeze sweet as the unbreathed air of Eden. I will not tire your\r\npatience with raptures about Rocky Mountain sunlight and scenery; the\r\nglorious peaks are always in sight, the aerial tints from the hand\r\nof the great Master are shifting and changeable as eastern skies at\r\nsunset--floating veils of exquisite hue hinting of a viewless glory\r\nbeyond. The wagon road is always good, and with song and story we\r\nbeguiled the way and listened with eager interest to a delightful\r\nlegend, prettily told by a reporter from St. Louis, which he said he\r\nhad from one of the medicine men of the Pueblos. All about “a spirit\r\nyet a woman, too,” who with bright green garments and silky yellow\r\ntresses flits above the maize fields, and in the night, robed with\r\ndarkness as a garment, draws a magic circle round them to keep off\r\nblight and vermin.\r\n\r\nIt had rather a familiar air and flavor, and when the story was ended,\r\none of the audience dryly inquired if the narrator had ever heard of\r\nLongfellow. St. Louis then came down reluctantly and confessed to\r\nhaving stolen the tradition from _Hiawatha_.\r\n\r\nWe missed our way, and in consequence had to jolt over one bad hill,\r\nso steep and cut with steps it reminded me of the gigantic precipitous\r\nstairs in the flight of Israel Putnam, a blood-curdling picture of\r\naffrighted rider and steed, the delight and terror of my childhood.\r\nBut this was a mighty hill of adamant, on which the flood, earthquakes\r\nand the centuries counted only in heaven have beaten and spent their\r\nstrength in vain. We did not care for delays. Time is no object on the\r\nfrontier. We lag along with exasperating slowness if you want to get\r\nthrough; are not expected at any place, sleep where the night overtakes\r\nus, and loiter at will in no fear of being behind time or caught in\r\na shower, a hap-hazard, good-for-nothing way of travel which gives a\r\nmild, game flavor to the journey. If you have a drop of gypsy blood in\r\nyou it will come to the surface, strawberry-mark and all, in New Mexico.\r\n\r\nAs we neared the village we passed pilgrims going up to the jubilee:\r\nmen, women, children in holiday attire, for once moved out of their\r\nstony rigidity of face and mien, smiling back to their last white\r\nmolars in answer to the courteous salutations exchanged by wayfarers\r\neverywhere in that Territory. The natives step with an easy swinging\r\ngait, apparently untired at the end of a day’s march as in the first\r\nhours of the morning. Their figures in motion are not without artistic\r\ngrace, expressing strength and fleetness; and when interested an alert\r\nintelligence lights the face, but ordinarily the cold, stony apathy of\r\nthe race is its ruling characteristic. One Pueblo marching beside us\r\nthat day I shall never forget. He was a very model of sinewy strength,\r\na perfect mountain prince, erect and stately in his crown of green\r\nleaves, and striped Navajo blanket draping his shoulders, held in place\r\nby one symmetric hand. The noblest Roman wore his imperial mantle\r\nwith no better grace. The attrition of civilization fails to make our\r\naborigines at all like “the white brother.” These peace-loving Pueblos,\r\na pastoral people pursuing their simple industries and trudging to\r\nmarket with their poor products, are as thoroughly Indian as the\r\nwildest Apache, with brandished knife and dripping scalp in hand,\r\ndancing on the battle field and whooping in triumph over the banquet of\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Israel Putnam hill we crossed a _mesa_ or table-land,\r\nand, descending into the valley of the Del Norte descried the village\r\nof the Santo Domingo, a tribe which numbers in all 1,129 souls.\r\nA little way off the main road, on the bank of the river, are the\r\nadobe houses, two stories high with the usual terraces. The roofs are\r\nsupported by pine logs, are nearly flat and covered with bark and\r\nearth. A few miles away are the ruins of ancient Pueblos, crumbling\r\nwalls whose thickness attests their age. Like all the prehistoric\r\nbuildings, they are on a high bluff two hundred feet above the\r\nwater. All ruins have a certain pathetic interest, but we did not\r\nturn aside to visit these, knowing it would be only a repetition of\r\narrowheads, stone hatchets and the tiresome pottery fragments. The old\r\narrowheads are mainly obsidian (_iztli_), usually black, sometimes\r\na smoky or brown tint. They are strewed through the earth wherever\r\ngraves of men have been found. To borrow the forcible sentence of\r\nHolmes, “Whether the arrowheads are a hundred or a thousand years old\r\nwho knows, who cares? There is no history to the red race, there is\r\nscarcely an individual in it. A few instincts on legs and holding a\r\ntomahawk;--there is the Indian of all time.”\r\n\r\nWe saw a party that day hunting rabbits with clubs which they throw,\r\nmaking a whirring sound like the boomerang of eastern savages. It is\r\nthe one sport in which women are allowed to take part. If in whirling\r\nhis missile a warrior misses a rabbit, which is finally killed by a\r\nsquaw, he is obliged by law or custom, which is equally strong, to\r\nchange clothes with her, and they return to the pueblo, or village,\r\nin that guise; Hercules and Omphale. He must also keep her in fresh\r\nmeat during the next winter, serving out his term of degradation in\r\nfeminine belongings, a target for aboriginal wit, and, for the season,\r\nthe village fool. Under such humiliating penalty for failure, we may\r\nimagine the experts throw the club with wondrous care and skill when\r\nwomen join in the chase.\r\n\r\nThis joke is immemorially old, handed down from the ancients or\r\nfathers, and is immortally fresh and delightful, tickling the fancy of\r\nthe red man.\r\n\r\nOn both sides of the river run chains of hills, those on the west side\r\nextending inland in extensive _mesas_; and not very far away to the\r\nsoutheast we trace, in aerial tints of supreme beauty, the serrated\r\nridges of the Sandia mountains.\r\n\r\nProperly speaking there are but two valleys in New Mexico; the Rio\r\nGrande and the Pecos. Should either stream go dry, starvation and\r\nfamine would follow. They flow nearly parallel, from north to south,\r\nfifty and sixty miles apart, till they reach Texas. Skirting their\r\nbanks are the cultivated fields, making a garden beauty with their\r\ntender verdure in contrast with the dull green of dry plains.\r\n\r\nBy the city of the saint sat a feminine mummy selling grapes. Her head\r\nwas dressed by the hands of time and nature after the style of Elisha,\r\nwhich so diverted the bad boys of Bethel, and she looked immovable as\r\nthe dead.\r\n\r\nShe and her store of fruitage, were sheltered from the sun blaze in\r\na booth of pine boughs; a little green bower called by the orientals\r\n_succôth_, a refreshment to the eyes in the shadeless stretch of the\r\nparched valleys. The wattle of twigs and leaves is such as Israel\r\nmade for himself in Canaan, and men of Galilee wove together of\r\nthick foliage on the pleasant skirts of Olivet, when they came up to\r\nJerusalem at the feast of the Passover; such as the Sharon peasant\r\nyet builds for his family at the Jerusalem gate of Jaffa. There was\r\nmuch beside this shady spot to remind us of Bible pictures; the low\r\nadobe houses, the flocks with the herdsman coming to drink at the\r\nshallow stream, the clambering goats in scanty pastures high up\r\nthe rocks, shaking their beards at the passing strangers, the kids\r\nbleating by their mothers, the Mexican women, straight as a rule,\r\ncarrying water-jars on head or shoulder, like maidens of Palestine.\r\nNow and then an old black shawl, melancholy remnant of the gay rebosa,\r\nshrouding an olive forehead, suggested the veiled face of the gentle\r\nRebecca. The lofty presence, the high eagle features of the Jewish\r\nrace, the lustrous eyes of the Orient are not here, nor is the barren\r\nmagnificence of New Mexico more than a suggestion of the land once the\r\nglory of all lands, with its verdure of plumy palms, beauty of olive\r\norchards, the dark foliage of cypress trees, and white and scarlet\r\nblooms of orange and pomegranate.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts pass through our mind as we wait in the wagon while the\r\ndriver, a Mexican boy, bargains with Pharoah’s daughter for the day’s\r\nsupply of grapes. We get three fine bunches for five cents, rich and\r\nnourishing, grown in sandy river bottoms irrigated with alkali water.\r\nThey are sweet as the ripest Italian vintage in terraced vineyards,\r\nwarmed by the volcanic heat throbbing in the fiery heart of Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nFor market, the purple clusters are laid lightly in crates made of\r\npine branches thick as your thumb, bound together by green withes of\r\nbark, lined with fresh leaves and packed on the backs of _burros_, the\r\nscriptural ass. The vine is not allowed to run, but is kept trimmed\r\nclose to the ground. Every year the branches are cut near to the parent\r\nstock, which is rarely more than four feet high.\r\n\r\nThe forlorn little town, built round a central plaza, was swept and\r\ngarnished ready for the holiday, and having shaken off its usual\r\ndrowse appeared quite lively. We were escorted with much dignity to\r\nan honored seat on one of the flat roofs reached by a rickety ladder.\r\nThere the ancient patriarchs of the tribe, too old to take the field,\r\nwere gathered, and with them old witches without witching ways,\r\nwrinkled, withered, graceless, seated in the favorite aboriginal pose\r\non their heels. The preliminary ceremony was held a few days before,\r\nwhen the first ears of corn began to ripen. They were gathered by the\r\nwomen, and, like the Jewish first fruits, the wave-offering in the\r\ntemple, were brought with solemn reverence to the high priest, who\r\nalone has the right to husk them for ascertaining if the promise of a\r\nfair harvest is assured. This done, criers were sent through the town\r\nannouncing to the people that, from his bright sun-house the god of the\r\nPueblos had smiled upon his children in bountiful crops, and they must\r\nmeet at high noon on a certain day and render unto him thanksgiving and\r\npraise.\r\n\r\nThe burning sky of noon, where no cloud flings a cooling shadow,\r\nscorches the valley with tropic fervor, but these children of the\r\nwilderness love its parching heat and open the solemnities when the\r\nflooding light is at meridian.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the open plaza four large camp-kettles of boiling corn\r\nwere swung gypsy fashion over separate fires. The tops of the poles\r\nwere adorned with twelve ears of corn representing the twelve months\r\nof the year. Each one was watched by four men, naked to the waist,\r\nwith bodies painted white, red, green, and blue. They are the four\r\nseasons, and are elected for their skill in singing and great powers\r\nof endurance. Their duty was to dance round the kettles, keep up the\r\nfires, and sing songs to Montezuma and the unnamed god, keeping time\r\nwith a cornstalk on the edge of the kettle. Did my reader ever hear\r\nIndian singing? He need never want to. It is a long-continued strain\r\nof unearthly howls and yells of the sort to drive one crazy, to make\r\nyour flesh, aye, the very marrow of your bones creep.\r\n\r\nAt exactly noon the grand procession moved, led by three Sagamores,\r\nholy heralds marching ahead, solemn and still as sphinxes. Then came\r\nthirty-five men, the dancers proper, naked except a small embroidered\r\nblanket, but appearing clad by reason of a coating of white paint\r\nbarred with blue. Their legs and arms were striped with red, white, and\r\nblue; green hemlock wreaths mixed with red berries of the mistletoe\r\ncircled their arms above the elbow.\r\n\r\nThe same ornamentation served as bracelets, anklets and necklaces, and\r\nresting on the thick black locks, newly washed with amolé and glossy\r\nas a blackbird’s throat, were crowns of gray eagle plumes. The effect\r\nof this adorning was that of a festal robe, unique and strikingly\r\npicturesque. Around the knees of the main actors were bands of red\r\ncloth to which hung small shells of the ground-turtle, eagle claws,\r\nand antelope hoofs; and dangling from the back at the waist was a fox\r\ntail or a fur robe, the skin of such wild animals as were killed by the\r\nwearer during the year. They walked in Indian file, each appearing to\r\ntread in the same track, bending forward as if weighted down with corn,\r\nwhich fiction is part of the play.\r\n\r\nThe musicians were placed in a conspicuous part of the plaza in the\r\nchief seats of the synagogue such artists love. One had a drum,\r\n(_tombe_) which he beat unmercifully, another clashed clanging, banging\r\nthings like cymbals, and a castinet player dextrously rattled deer\r\nhoofs after the manner of the jolly end man, our friend and brudder\r\nBones. One ambitious artist performed on an ornamented whistle made\r\nfrom the bone of a wild turkey’s wing, blowing shrilly with unlimited\r\nbreath, as St. Louis observed, _sotto voce_, loud enough to split the\r\nears of corn. There was, besides, a heathenish instrument of torture,\r\nwhose name I failed to obtain, consisting of half a gourd with the\r\nconvex side up; on this was placed with the left hand a smooth stick\r\nand across it the right hand drew backward and forward a notched stick\r\nin a sawing manner, making a sound like the grinding of corn in the\r\n_metate_. Luckily this machine does not make much racket, but what\r\nthere is, is of the quality calculated to turn one goose-flesh. The\r\nsound of filing saws is rich melody in comparison.\r\n\r\nThe three sphinxes, members of the council who headed the procession,\r\nmade a short speech before each house, the occupants being outside\r\nand waiting. At special places they joined the choral howling of the\r\ntrains, which proceeded with the dire monotony of everything Indian.\r\nThus they went from house to house till every one was serenaded, and\r\nfrom each roof corn was handed and added to the common stock. My\r\nknowledge of San Domingan being rather limited, I am unable to furnish\r\na correct report of the brief speeches. Doubtless they were like white\r\nmen’s public occasions; carefully prepared impromptu. These ended, they\r\nsung and danced to the plaza, circling round the boiling kettles, in\r\none hand rattling a sacred gourd containing grains of corn, and covered\r\nwith tribal symbols and ancestral totems marked in red paint; in the\r\nother swinging a quantity of _tortillas_ (rolls of corn bread) tied\r\ntogether with thread, like a bunch of cigars.\r\n\r\nThe corn is a species of the very hard flint. The grains yellow or\r\nbluish black and red, sometimes all three on one cob. The stalk is\r\nperhaps four feet high, the ears growing near the ground. Thin corn\r\ncakes, _tortillas_, are the principal food of Mexican and Indian, and\r\nthe women pride themselves on the skill and speed with which they\r\nmake them. The shelled grains are boiled in water with a little lime\r\nto soften the skin so that it can be pulled off, then it is ground\r\ninto meal by mashing with a long round stone, like our rolling-pin,\r\nagainst an oblong, slightly hollowed stone called a _metate_. A little\r\nwater is added, making it the consistence of gruel, and it is baked in\r\nthin cakes on hot stones or griddles of tin or copper. When done they\r\nare the color of a hornet’s nest and tasteless as white paper. Once\r\naccustomed to them strangers become very fond of _tortillas_.\r\n\r\nAt an appointed signal the corn was taken from the kettle, burnt in the\r\nconsecrated fire, and the ashes sprinkled over the fields to insure\r\na good crop next year; then another fire was kindled, and kettles\r\nre-filled with corn, and when boiled freely distributed to all the\r\npeople, who heartily enjoyed the banquet.\r\n\r\nSuch is the green corn dance; a yearly delight celebrated in the\r\nchangeless fashion set before these people in the primeval years. New\r\nand startling figures are not in the program. Their ambition is to do\r\nall according to the traditions of the elders. As the day advanced the\r\necstacy increased, the dancers shuffled and hopped as if they would\r\nshuffle off this mortal coil. Convulsive stamping and leaping made\r\nwith frantic gestures; the din of savage minstrelsy; the guttural,\r\nunrhythmed voices and the hideous “_tombe_,” a hollow log covered at\r\nthe ends with dried hide, made a barbaric uproar that lingers long on\r\nsenses attuned to harmony.\r\n\r\nI must not close without mention of the dogs of You-pel-lay. Admitted\r\nto that equal sky, they were given the right to a voice in the matter\r\nand toward evening they embarked in a tumultuous, unearthly fantasia.\r\nAs we scaled the Israel Putnam hill the soft night wind fell on our\r\nhot, tired faces like the cool touch of holy water, and floated after\r\nus the farewell symphonies of the revelry. And they were all pow-wow\r\nand bow-wow.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the classic reader, if I am so fortunate as to have one, may\r\nbe reminded in this festival of the haunted vale of Enna and its\r\nlovely fables; mythic stories filled with hidden meaning veiled by the\r\nsplendors of the Eleusinian mysteries. It is the instinctive spirit\r\nof gratitude to the Lord of the harvest, the keeper of the destinies;\r\nand the poverty of this race and their rude rites are to the genius\r\nand varied wealth of ancient Greece only the difference of blood and\r\ncivilization everywhere between the Old World and the New.\r\n\r\nThe squaws wear no wreaths and have no share in these ceremonials, but\r\nadoring women are the same the world over, and out of their own hearts\r\ncreate the glory and beauty of the shrines where they burn precious\r\nincense and kneel for worship. They looked on in secret rapture with\r\nlove-light in their eyes, an expression I have seen in the face of a\r\nlistening wife in the senate gallery, when the man foremost of all\r\nthe world to her speaks the words which thrill the crowd to silence.\r\nIn Santo Domingo there is no noiseless telegraphy of swimming eye or\r\nwaving hand. Little does the sullen red sachem care for the subtle\r\nflattery of loving admiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. THE CITY OF THE PUEBLOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTen generations of men have come and gone since Don Antonio de Espego\r\ndistilled a subtle Spanish essence in _El Palacio_; and you may break,\r\nyou may shatter those walls, if you will, but the scent of Espagna will\r\nhang round it still. Under the witchery of that fast-fading charm, a\r\ntroop of attendant graces hover about its _portal_. They bear musical\r\nnames of sweet meaning, as the discreet damsels who welcomed pilgrims\r\nto the blessed rooms in the House Beautiful. Perfectio (perfection),\r\na worthless peon, in Navaho blanket, sweeps the sidewalk; Benito (the\r\ngood), a shambling Mexican boy, watching his chance for a spring at\r\nthe spoons, brings the daily mail; Mariposa (butterfly), the silliest\r\nof Slowboys, pushes the baby-wagon; while Angellus, an angel whose\r\nform has lost its original brightness, lazily watches her. Three old\r\nwitches, whom we familiarly call the Macbeths, were baptized some\r\ncenturies ago Feliciana, the Happy; Rosita, little Rose; Hermosa, the\r\nBeautiful.\r\n\r\nIt is the month of July, and the cotton-wood trees of the Plaza are\r\na mass of tender leafage in restless flutter, giving color and cool\r\nsound, most grateful in a land where sterility is the rule, fertility\r\nthe rare and marked exception. The _acequias_ are open, and they\r\nmoisten earth and air in the square of _alfalfa_, or Spanish clover,\r\nknee-deep.\r\n\r\nQuite out of reach of the shady trees, in the fiercest blaze of the\r\nsun, sitting on a fragment of the Rocky Mountains, is a statuesque\r\nfigure, which might represent the oldest of the Fates, the most\r\nfurious of the Furies. It is Blandina, the fair one, the soft one,\r\nof Santa Fé. Her face, like one of her own foot-hills, is worn into\r\ngutters and seams. Not like them so moulded by the action of water,\r\nbut by exposure to sharp sunlight and withering wind, destructive\r\nto beauty, which make even young persons appear old. Her skin is a\r\nparchment, which looks as though it might date back to--I was about to\r\nsay the Flood; but that would imply that at some prehistoric era she\r\nhad felt the sanitary influence of a shower-bath, and I would not harm\r\nan innocent fellow-creature by such an unjust suspicion. Her draperies\r\nare a mere dissolving view. There sits the Mexican woman, day after\r\nday, not begging, nor even reaching out her hand, but following the\r\npasser-by with beseeching eyes, haunting as the eyes of the dead. Like\r\nall the very poor, she keeps a dog and smokes incessantly.\r\n\r\nThe great mass of population here is very swarthy, and there are but\r\nfew who have no Indian blood in their veins. The traveller in New\r\nMexico may breakfast in a ranche where the occupants have the clear\r\ncinnamon hue; dine at another where the faces are ashen, like the\r\nMalay’s; and pass the night at a third where the courteous host will\r\nshow the deep Vandyke brown of the Negro. The explanation is easy. The\r\ndifferent inhabitants of the several places are sprung from various\r\ntribes. The Ute has a dingy, tallow complexion, the Apache is a dirty\r\nashen gray, while the Mohave girls have cheeks of almost Spanish\r\ntransparency.\r\n\r\nBesides the luxuries and refinements of the furthest East, the Moors\r\nleft behind them in Spain many descendants, the children of Spanish\r\nmarriages. Some of these were among the dauntless adventurers who\r\ncame to _Nueva Mejico_ in the XVIth century. They intermarried with\r\nthe Indians, mingling three strains of blood, which mixture is called\r\nMexican. The conquering foreigners were not all olive-skinned. Some\r\nof the first who sailed the sea boasted, and evidently were, of the\r\n_sangre azul_, brought into Spain by the wild Goths. The lover of\r\nPrescott will remember his description of the watchful gray eyes of\r\nCortez, and the clear blue eyes of Alvarado, whose yellow locks, fair\r\nforehead, and beard yellow as gold, gave him a peculiar expression\r\nof sunniness, from which the Aztecs called him _Tonitiah_--“Child of\r\nthe Sun.” Scattered at long distances through New Mexico are a few\r\n_ricos_, of almost Saxon fairness, remote descendants of the people\r\nwho brought the exquisite architecture of Asia to perfect flower in\r\nthe shades of the Alhambra--departing traces of the northern tribes to\r\nwhich southern Europe owes some of its best elements of strength. Their\r\nblue eyes, glancing from under the slouched _sombrero_, and sunburnt\r\nhair, stringing down the _serape_, affect one strangely. It is like\r\nfinding Albinos among the Zuñi and Moqui Indians, and involuntarily\r\nwe ask: “What manner of men are these?” Tawny color is seen in every\r\ngrade of society and some of the highest citizens are plainly of Indian\r\nextraction. The restless energy of the Spaniard, the quick perception\r\nof the Moor, even the cunning of the roving Apache, appear to be lost\r\nin the sluggish current which lazily beats in the pulses of the modern\r\nMexican.\r\n\r\nAmong the common people is one distinguishing trait, the utter lack of\r\nbeauty. I have frequented every day crowds, and haunted churches, where\r\nthey are to be seen at their best, and have found not one attractive\r\nface. Nowhere on earth comes age so fast or in such repulsive shape.\r\nA lovely baby changes to the plain young girl, somewhat comely, at\r\nfifteen. At twenty-five not a vestige of freshness remains; not a line\r\nto remind one of beauty vanished forever. And oh! the hideous hags\r\nsquatted against the walls! There is no speculation in those eyes,\r\nfixed as the eternal gaze of the Sphinx. They look old as that grim\r\nfemale, and I would as soon think stone lips could part into a company\r\nsmile, displaying false teeth, as that these could break into laughter\r\nor song. I wonder what they are thinking about, if they think at all,\r\nor if an earthquake would make them jump. Assuredly, they are the most\r\nopaque of terrestrial bodies, and, under the old black shawl, they sit\r\nimmovable, as though all the forces of the universe (rarely heard from\r\nin Santa Fé) could not start them from their secure poise.\r\n\r\nDr. Holmes says “the finest human fruit, and especially the finest\r\nwomen, we get in New England are raised under glass. _Protection_ is\r\nwhat the transplanted Aryan requires in this New England climate.” I\r\nfancy “protection” is what the women need in the “excessive,” the\r\nterritorial climate analogous to that of Central Asia. On this bleak,\r\nelevated plateau, where the dryness is so intense that meat is cured\r\nwithout smoke or salt, the juices of the human body evaporate, leaving\r\nearly wrinkles. I have seen men in high health return from a month of\r\ncamping among the Rocky Mountains with crow’s feet wofully deepened and\r\nthe appearance of having “aged” in a very short time.\r\n\r\nPerhaps dirt and low diet have helped to finish the completed ugliness\r\nof the Santa Fé witches; but we know extremes of every sort waste\r\nnervous force, and hasten the steps of the common enemy, who sharpens\r\nhis scythe for the faces of women, and shakes the sand in the glass\r\nwhen he measures their years.\r\n\r\nMoisture, when it does come, is not the gentle rain from Heaven,\r\nswelling bud and flower, as well as human hearts, to thankfulness.\r\nThere is no dew; nor is there showering mist, like that which went\r\nup from the earth and watered the garden eastward in Eden. We have,\r\ninstead, high wind-storms, rain streaming in torrents, preceded by an\r\natmosphere where men and animals are acting lightning-rods for electric\r\ncurrents; keen, close lightning and the “_live_ thunder” of which Byron\r\nsung. Suddenly the mighty music stops. The sun flashes out in unveiled\r\nsplendor, flooding the world with blinding light, and we are tempted\r\nto tread a sun-dance in worship of the glittering God of the Pueblos,\r\nwho inhabits eternity, lord of Heaven and earth, son of the morning and\r\nfather of all the days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. MEXICAN COTTAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcross the way are a dozen Mexicans, wrapped in greasy old blankets,\r\nsitting like four-and-twenty blackbirds all in a row. I know their\r\nfaces, and have not missed one in a month. They live in condition\r\nof body and mind hard for an American to realize. A kind of present\r\nexistence, without loving reference to the past; a passive waiting for\r\nthe future, without an inquiry or a wish, a fear or a hope. Small,\r\nlank, dark-brown fellows; eight with high cheek-bones and thick\r\nlips, betraying Indian blood; hair long, straight, black; eyes dark,\r\nsuspicious, wavering; habitually silent; when speaking, with gloomy\r\nindifference, in a voice sad as memory. Elsewhere they would go as\r\ntramps; but tramping is a grand fatigue. They prefer to sit round,\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\nIt is said this is the bearing of every conquered race; but such is\r\nthe average Mexican wherever he is found. About the hill of royal\r\nChapultepec, at the base of the pyramid of Cholula--last vestige of\r\nAztecan grandeur--he basks in the sun with the chameleons and lizards,\r\ndocile in temper, patient under abuse, idle as the wind that lifts his\r\nlong, black locks. Think you such men care for advantages, natural or\r\npolitical--They know the joy of a splendid destiny fulfilled or the\r\nanguish of such a destiny lost? They come of brave blood--Spaniard,\r\nMoor, Indian--and how well they fight for their own, the United States,\r\nFrance, and Austria may testify; but to us never did life appear so\r\nempty, aimless, and joyless as the life of these sitters in the sun.\r\n\r\nThe puzzling question of to-day is: How do they keep soul and body\r\ntogether? Let us find one in his home, if the dingy den he inhabits may\r\nbe called by that dear name. Leaving the Plaza, where vagrants most do\r\ncongregate, we pass the cottages of “the military” (on whose heads be\r\nthe blessing of those who entertain strangers), cross a sandy _arroya_,\r\nthrough which in the rainy season a mountain torrent sweeps roaring.\r\nWestward the straggling suburb stretches toward the foothills, and,\r\nstumbling along a stony path, we suddenly come up against a wall. It\r\nis about six feet high, made of mud mixed with ashes, coal, cow-horns,\r\nhoofs, mule-bones, barrel-hoops, the wheels of a baby-wagon, cans,\r\nbroken bottles, boots, curry-combs, every refuse substance that may\r\nswell the mass in a treeless region. The top of the wall bristles with\r\nscraps of tin, which make it hard to climb. I doubt if Romeo would try\r\nit, even to seize the white wonder of Juliet’s hand. The gate is made\r\nof upright posts of dwarf cedar, thick as a man’s wrist, bound together\r\nby rawhide strings, and groans and creaks in a dismal note as we push\r\nit on wooden hinges. Not a trace of iron is to be seen.\r\n\r\nThis formidable outwork encloses three puppies, of the breed called\r\ncast-iron, which look like magnified rats and act wonderfully like\r\ncats. The proprietor of the estate and his spouse, in the doorway, sit\r\nin the artistic pose called squat, at leisure profound, if not elegant.\r\nHe is evidently made of the same clay as his wretched mud shanty; might\r\nhave sprouted up from the ground or dropped down from the eaves.\r\n\r\nAs we enter, they rise in unembarrassed politeness. He removes his\r\nslouch of a hat with decorous gravity, and the wife entreats us to\r\nenter, saying, with the air of a princess in exile, we do her great\r\nhonor. The Spanish flavor is strong here, which may be the reason she\r\nwears dragging bright calicoes all the year, and sits in the door even\r\nwhen the snow falls. Her raven black hair and large, full eyes hint of\r\nby-gone beauty; but it is by-gone. Premature wrinkles are worn deep by\r\nthe shriveling wind, her skin is swart and sunburnt, and the roses in\r\nher cheek are only ashes of roses.\r\n\r\n“Would she give us a drink of water?”\r\n\r\n“With much pleasure, _Señora_.”\r\n\r\nShe diffuses an air of elegance over her pink calico toilet by throwing\r\na dreary old black shawl round her head; and, scorning to lift her\r\nvoluminous train (twelve yards for a dollar), hastens to the nearest\r\n_acequia_, or irrigating ditch, fills a mug of Indian pottery, and\r\noffers it with sweetness and grace. No new country exuberance about\r\nher, nor revelling imagination, like Dick Swiveller’s; but a power of\r\nenchantment and a lofty self-poise which no surprise can startle or\r\ndisturb. It is found alike in splendor or in squalor, the “grand air”\r\nof Old Spain, descended to all who have a dash of her blood.\r\n\r\nMy hostess regrets the water is not wine, and so catching is the fine\r\ncharm that, ensnared and deluded, I am hardly sure it is not wine,\r\nand drink their health in the miserable ditch-water and am cheered\r\nby responsive _gracias_. I try to explain that I am under silken\r\nbonds--ribbons red, blue, white--not to look upon wine when it is\r\nred; but it is their first hearing of temperance, and they do not\r\nunderstand. She invites me to a seat on the _colchon_--a wool mattress\r\nfolded against the wall and covered with a blanket, which serves the\r\ndouble purpose of bed by night and sofa by day, an Oriental custom,\r\ncome down to them from the Moors. I excuse myself, being in mortal fear\r\nof old settlers in the mattress. There a lovely baby, with no dress to\r\nspeak of, is tossing up its heels. I ask some questions, thinking of\r\nbright eyes far away; and she prettily says baby has no year yet, and\r\nher name is Lola Juanita Eloisa.\r\n\r\nThe earthen floor is swept with a bunch of broom, without handle,\r\nleaning against the mud fireplace in the corner of the room. There\r\nare no andirons, shovel, or tongs, and when fire is made the wood is\r\nplaced on end against the back of the fireplace. A chest, a few pieces\r\nof crockery on a pine table, complete the furniture. Can you imagine\r\nlove in such a cottage? Undoubtedly there is love, and in the poorest\r\n_jacal_ there is no brawling man, scolding, slapping wife, or crying\r\nbaby. If the walls crack, they are daubed by Magdalena Rosalia with a\r\nfresh plaster of _yeso_, or gypsum, put on with a glove of sheepskin.\r\nIf the outside flakes and cracks too badly, it is smeared with a new\r\ncoating of soft mud. In the spring the ground floor has another layer\r\nof clay, the fireplace a thin coating of _tierra amarilla_, or yellow\r\nwash, and house-cleaning is ended. Does the roof leak, a dab of mud is\r\nslapped on. Is the outer wall in holes, a lump of clay will stop the\r\nwind away. There is no window, and when the door is closed the house\r\nmust be dark and stifling as a dungeon. Above the fireplace, done in\r\nhectic chromo and framed in tin is a copy of the divine Madonna in\r\nthe Louvre, named “Queen of Heaven”; a band of blue stars across her\r\nforehead, a tinsel crescent under her feet. Hanging below it is a\r\nplaster crucifix, under glass. When the bell chimes, Magdalena Rosalia\r\nwill seek the old cathedral, whose vaulted interior is filled with\r\nshadows and silence--among them a few figures, motionless as the dead\r\nasleep under the floors--say her prayers across the rosary, confess,\r\nand be absolved. But Trinidad Gonzalez Ribera, in the gauzy blanket and\r\nvanishing pantaloons, will sit dozing in the sun, deaf to the ringing\r\nmusic, unmindful of bell, book, or candle. I pass from under the\r\nhospitable mud roof with repeated _adios_ and a feeling of unreality.\r\nI look for a garden. There is none. There are no chickens, no pig, no\r\ncow, no grass within the gravelly enclosure.\r\n\r\nThe only sign of life is a famished donkey, browsing on the strip of\r\ngrass which borders the _acequia_ by the roadside. He is the property\r\nof our new friends, and occasionally the man of many names takes him\r\nto the mountains, loads him with limbs of dead _piñones_, and sells\r\nthem for twenty-five cents a backload. Stopping on the plain, he digs\r\na few roots of _amolé_, or soap-weed; the _yucca aloifolia_, which we\r\ncultivate for its rich cream-white blossoms. This is for the washing\r\ndone by Magdalena Rosalia.\r\n\r\nDo not think she briskly knocks so early Monday morning or comes Sunday\r\nnight for the clothes, as wicked Protestants have been known to do.\r\nNo; this daughter of a proud line will not shame her high ancestry by\r\nvulgar haste. She saunters along about noon, seats herself at ease,\r\nmakes affectionate inquiries as to every member of the household, with\r\na gift of continuance and native talent for rigmarole which would\r\ndo honor to a legislative body. She deliberately ties the bundle of\r\nclothes, balances it on her head, and departs with sweeping courtesy\r\nand majestic flirt of pink calico train.\r\n\r\nAfter walking a few blocks, she stops for a rest, adjusts her bundle\r\ninto a cushion on the ground, takes from her pocket a little package of\r\ncorn-husks, fills one with fine-cut tobacco from a paper box, rolls it\r\ninto a _cigarrito_, and enjoys a smoke. A Monday picture in Santa Fé\r\nis the long row of wash-women, with the everlasting black shawls over\r\ntheir heads, sitting in the shade of mud walls, quietly gossiping and\r\nsmoking. To get the clothes home is exertion enough for one day.\r\n\r\nTuesday she repairs to the Rio Santa Fé weakened by irrigating ditches\r\nto a shallow brook, and on its sandy bank makes a little fire for\r\nwashing. Her machine is one bucket and a square tin box. She pounds the\r\nclothes between two stones. Flannels full, buttons fly, embroideries\r\nare a dream of things that were. She boils them in the box, set on\r\ngranite; rinses in the pure snow-water of the Rio; and spreads them on\r\nthe rocks to dry, as the young Roman girls do along the Tiber. Friday,\r\nin comes Magdalena Rosalia, with all beautifully white, folded in an\r\nIndian basket shaped like a deep saucer.\r\n\r\nThe proceeds of this labor buy a bag of blue corn-meal and the\r\nnecessary tobacco. Twice a week they can afford a stew of _chili con\r\ncarne_ (our old friend hash, made fiery hot with red pepper) and the\r\nliving is made. As respects worldly goods, come he soon or late, Death\r\nwill find this pair exactly as they entered life, exactly as their\r\nfathers lived and died, in the peaceful depths of contented poverty.\r\nMagdalena Rosalia walks as though she was born in the purple, to\r\nlive like the lilies who toil not neither do they spin; and Trinidad\r\nGonzalez Ribera is free of care as though his old Navajo blanket was\r\na king’s coronation robe. At the grave’s edge it not unfrequently\r\nhappens that his mourning friends, too poor to spare his blanket, strip\r\nit from his body, and lay him away in the dust from whence he sprung,\r\nshroudless and uncoffined.\r\n\r\nThese are the happy people sighed for by weary poets in all the ages.\r\nSimple souls who love the sun, live close to Nature, and in the dirt\r\nhouse, to which nothing is added, where nothing is repaired except\r\nby additional dirt, are serene as summer, filled with a measureless\r\ncontent. Can we say so much for the eager, ambitious conqueror in a\r\nstruggle, a battle, and a race; always getting ready to live, looking\r\nto the future when he may have time to rest and enjoy?\r\n\r\nThe Mexican does not wait for better times. There is no day but this.\r\nHe begins now and the future takes care of itself.\r\n\r\nOh! tired woman of “the States,” running on your nerve, trying to do\r\nall the public demands of you and all you require of yourself, leave\r\nthe place where the door bell rings every half hour. Quit worrying\r\nover goose-parties for the Sunday-school, Jarley’s wax-works for the\r\nfiremen; slip away from strawberry parties for the Gaboon Mission;\r\nslacken the fevered rush; loosen the strings at concert pitch and ready\r\nto snap; go to the Mexican woman, consider her ways, and learn how to\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nOf course, you, my precious reader, know many things she does not.\r\nThere never has been a woman’s meeting in this territory of 207,000\r\nsquare miles; and, in consequence, the weak-minded creature is not\r\naware that men are great rascals, rob women of their rights, and bar\r\nthe avenues to wealth and fame against them. Sing the Iliad of your\r\nwoes, and it will fall on heedless ears. And, though you harp how\r\nJuliet’s poetry flew up the kitchen-chimney and Portia’s eloquence\r\nburnt out over the gridiron where her\r\n\r\n  ----“red right hand grew raging hot,\r\n  Like Cranmer’s at the _steak_.”\r\n\r\nshe would quietly adjust the old black shawl (final remnant and\r\nmelancholy reminder of the gay _rebosa_) and count the days till the\r\nnext _fiesta_.\r\n\r\nThere are heights beyond her reach, and beyond your reach too, in spite\r\nof mighty purpose. She does not strain after them, wearing herself to\r\nskin and bone. While you, who have tasted bitter fruit from the tree of\r\nknowledge, are ready to die in a losing struggle for the unattainable,\r\nshe loiters in happy valley, by good spirits tenanted, and in her easy\r\nshoe wears the four-leaved clover of perpetual content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. TO THE TURQUOIS MINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nReader, are you the sort of person who rushes through life the first\r\npassenger on the earliest train; who hires the fastest coach at\r\nNiagara, to exhaust the Falls, the Whirlpool, and Lundy’s Lane in\r\nhalf a day, and are then ready to whiz off in the night express? If\r\nyou are, then are we no company for each other, and may as well part\r\nat once. You are entirely unfit for frontier travel and may go this\r\nminute. _Adios! Adios!_\r\n\r\nBut you who lingered by the Rapids; who have a kindly glance for\r\nthe smutty sentinel at the brake; who do not threaten to die when\r\nthe gentlemanly conductor fills the car full and corks it tight\r\nas a champagne bottle, but live on in order to cheer a gasping\r\nfellow-martyr; who help the mediæval lady, of convex outline, traveling\r\nwith two geraniums and a canary bird, yet keep a sympathetic eye for\r\nthe young pair in the new of the moon, murmuring, as they pass, I too\r\nhave dwelt in Arcadia.--You are the one I love. Yours are the feet,\r\nbeauteous on the mountain-top, that go gypsying with me through this\r\nNew World, which Agassiz tells us is the Old.\r\n\r\nWe travel in a hap-hazard way, varied with many a digression, following\r\nno train but our own fancies. We stop to speak with the natives by the\r\nway, try to sketch a Gifford sunset on a gritty scratch-book, and stray\r\nfrom the road for bits of cheating mica, and for flowers which wilt in\r\nthe gathering, and change in our hands to dry stalks and grasses.\r\n\r\nThe mountains are eternally beautiful, always changing, forever new,\r\nand all about us is picture. Walking for rest, the grama grass is soft\r\nand pleasant under the pilgrim’s feet; the sun always shines; the days\r\nare like the enchanted rooms in the fairy castle, each more beautiful\r\nthan every other; the air is balm, and oil, and wine.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing pleasanter than such travel, unless it be to float\r\nbetween blue and blue among the Cyclades, and idly drift along the\r\ntideless sea, to catch the far echo of the syren songs that wooed the\r\nwandering Ulysses.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the Turquois Mines.\r\n\r\nTo one who was an early and ardent admirer of _Lalla Rookh_, the\r\nword turquois brings up memories of old or, rather, young days among\r\nfragrant orchard trees, meadows pink and white with clover-blooms,\r\nand a certain fine-printed, sight-destroying volume of the poet whose\r\nhundredth birthday we have just celebrated. It is like a fading dream\r\nto look from the shadowy half-way house at the girl embowered among\r\nsinging birds, reading, with dazzled eyes, of swords inlaid with rich\r\nmarquetry, talismans, and characters of the scimitar of Solomon. Arms of\r\n\r\n  “The wild warriors of the Turquois Hills,”\r\n\r\nwho rallied to the white veil and glittering banner of the False\r\nProphet.\r\n\r\nThe perfumed and sparkling poem which thrilled so many soft hearts at\r\nlife’s morning is not loved by lovers of this age. Only the setting\r\ngeneration--and they mainly for the sake of old times--read “The Veiled\r\nProphet of Khorassan,” and in the twilight pensively sing “Araby’s\r\nDaughter,” with voice not altogether fresh. In the days when that fond\r\nfarewell was first sung it was taught that turquoises belonged chiefly\r\nto the Turkish and Persian Empires. Since then the ceaseless delving\r\nof the antiquary has given to the world such treasure far removed from\r\nthe Shah’s dominions. There are mines of high antiquity in Mount Sinai,\r\nand a bronze finger-ring, of unique pattern, set with turquoises, has\r\nbeen discovered in the Wady Meghara of that peninsula. It dates back to\r\nthe vague, unreal period of the Fourth Dynasty; and amulets of the same\r\nmaterial are unearthed in the ruins of ancient Egyptian towns. They are\r\nfound in Arabia Petrea, in a stratum of red sandstone, of finer blue\r\nand darker shade than the Persian, and the visitor of Roman museums\r\nsees antique cameos and intaglios carved in Arabian turquois, sadly\r\nfaded and tarnished by long burial. Only a few in the Vatican still\r\nretain their color.\r\n\r\nThose of Khorassan are sold in Russia on sticks, tied in bunches\r\nlike quills, and are in demand by jewelers of St. Petersburg, for\r\nenriching sword-hilts, handles of daggers, belts, pipes, etc. The Shah\r\nis reported to have in keeping all the finest gems, allowing only the\r\ninferior grades to leave the country.\r\n\r\nIn a curious old treatise on precious stones the turquois is described\r\nas a delicate and sensitive jewel, which has an affinity for its\r\nowner, changing color with his health and varying fortunes. The fact\r\nthat they do change color in a wholly unaccountable manner may explain\r\nthe fanciful notion. Human hearts are the same everywhere and in all\r\nages, and many a myth and superstition of the East is reproduced in\r\nMexico--plain testimony that Orientalism dwells not alone in its sky\r\nand the palm trees of the valley.\r\n\r\nIt interested me greatly to find that the pretty legend of the Orient\r\nattaches to the turquois of the New World, called by the ancient Aztec\r\n_chalchuite_ (pronounced chal-chew-e-te).\r\n\r\nLike the Asiatic, the Aztecan believed it brought good fortune to the\r\nwearer, glowed in sympathy with the healthful beating of his pulse,\r\nand ominously paled in prophecy of a coming misfortune. The power of\r\nthe Montezumas was absolute, as their dominion was vast; and wherever\r\nthe green banner of the king marked the limit of his realm, the\r\n_chalchuite_ was, by imperial decree, forbidden to the commonalty--the\r\njewel sacred to the royal house. When the five ambassadors from Totonac\r\ncame to the tent of Cortez, at Vera Cruz, they defied the law (being\r\nthen at war with the fierce and bloody Aztec), and wore the proscribed\r\njewels--“gems of a bright blue stone, in their ears and nostrils.”[14]\r\n\r\nReaders of Prescott will remember his picturesque page describing the\r\ncity of Tezcuco, where North American civilization reached its height.\r\nIn the royal palace was a hall of justice, called the “Tribunal of\r\nGod,” where the judge decided important causes and passed sentence of\r\ndeath, seated on a throne of pure gold, inlaid with the consecrated\r\nturquois.\r\n\r\nThe art of cutting gems was carried to high perfection by the Aztecs,\r\nand the carved _chalchuite_ is noted by every writer on the Spanish\r\nConquest.\r\n\r\nFather Sahagun calls it a jasper of very green color, “or a common\r\nsmaragdus,” so precious to the infidel that the use of them was\r\nprohibited by royal edict to any but the nobility. “It represented\r\nto them everything that was excellent in its kind; for which reason\r\nthey put such a stone in the mouth of distinguished chiefs who died,”\r\nlike the coin poetry offered to the grim ferryman of the souls of the\r\nGreek dead.[15] They were valued by the heathen above all earthly\r\npossessions, and, therefore, at first held in great estimation by the\r\nSpaniards. The art of polishing them came from Heaven, the gift of\r\nthe god Quetzelcoatl, a gentle deity who instructed the Aztecs in the\r\nuse of metals, agriculture, and the arts of government. It was in the\r\ngolden age of Anahuac, when an ear of Indian corn was as much as one\r\nman could carry, when the air was filled with the melody of birds, the\r\nearth with flowers, and cotton in the field took of its own accord\r\nthe rich dye of cochineal. Cholula was his favorite city, where the\r\nmassy ruins of the temple dedicated to his worship form one of the\r\nmost interesting relics of ancient Mexico. By command of the superior\r\ndeities, he took leave of his worshipers on the shores of the Mexican\r\nGulf, under promise to return, and, entering his wizard skiff, made of\r\nserpents’ skins, sailed away to the blooming shores of happy Tlapallan.\r\n\r\nThe earliest mention of this historic gem is made by the honest old\r\nsoldier, Bernal Diaz. Four _chalchuites_, counted the most precious\r\nofferings from his treasury, were among the first presents sent by\r\nMontezuma to Cortez. “A gift to our emperor, designed as a mark of\r\nhighest respect, as each of them, they assured us, was worth more than\r\na wagon-load of gold.” The covetous Spaniard was enraptured with the\r\ngold-dust and jewels, and gave in exchange--a sorry return for the\r\nmunificence of the imperial present--a few Holland shirts, and a string\r\nof trumpery beads, strongly perfumed with musk.\r\n\r\nOn sending the priceless Aztecan diamonds, “worth four wagon-loads\r\nof gold,” to Valladolid, it turned out, rather awkwardly for the\r\nSpaniards, that they were not worth so many wagon-loads of earth.\r\n\r\nThe gossiping Herodotus of the New World alludes to the _chalchuite_\r\nagain in his narrative of the first meeting of Montezuma and Cortez,\r\non the Causeway, at the entrance to Mexico, city of enchantment. That\r\nfatal day, when the force of his own genius brought the representative\r\nof the strongest empire of the Old World face to face with the\r\nmightiest monarch of the New, its pale lustre shone dimly in the fringe\r\nof the canopy held by the _Caciques_ above the hapless monarch’s head.\r\n“A canopy of exceeding great value,” says the quaint chronicler,\r\n“decorated with green feathers, gold and silver, _chalchuis_ stones\r\nand pearls, which hung down from a bordering altogether curious to\r\nlook at.”\r\n\r\nIts delicately-traced veins, occasionally of greenish hue, betray a\r\nnear kinship to malachite. This rich-tinted mineral is finer than\r\nthe dark-colored stone of Russia, and though by no means costly as\r\nShylock’s turquoise, the _chalchuite_ still holds its high repute among\r\nthe various tribes of the red race.\r\n\r\nIt is valued by the Navajo beyond the garnets and beryls of his own\r\ncountry, and is used as currency among the half-civilized Pueblos of\r\nNew Mexico and Arizona. The Indian girls along the Colorado wear it as\r\na love-token in their necklaces; the roving and tameless Apache covets\r\na blue bead as an amulet; the degraded Ute loves its soft glimmer;\r\nand when a Mohave chief would assume regal splendor, he sticks a\r\nthree-cornered piece of _chalchuite_ in his royal nose.\r\n\r\nSuch associations fresh in mind, it was with extreme pleasure I\r\nprepared for an excursion to Los Cerillos, where these blue-eyed gems\r\nare found, the only mines as yet discovered this side the Russian seas.\r\nTwenty-six miles southwest of Santa Fé are the long, narrow ranges of\r\ngold and silver-bearing mountains--Placer, Sandia, Manzana, etc.--which\r\nform an unbroken chain on the eastern side of the Rio Grande. Among\r\nthem are three turquoise mines, which anciently supplied the Indian\r\nmarket of North America.\r\n\r\nA roomy ambulance, drawn by four mules; various delights, liquid and\r\nsolid, in a mess-chest; a party of choice spirits, like my reader; and\r\na morning such as breaks nowhere but over the hills of Paradise and New\r\nMexico--this was our start.\r\n\r\nOur driver was a young Mexican, bearing a lengthy and musical name,\r\nwith which I shall not serenade you. Juan Fresco (Cool John) is a\r\nminute fragment of it. He was very spruce in a brand-new suit of\r\nkerseymere, of the sort sold throughout the frontier by Israelites in\r\nwhom there is much guile; a handsome Navajo blanket closely woven and\r\nbrightly striped; and was happy in possession of a limitless supply\r\nof corn husks and powdered tobacco which he rolled into cigarettes\r\nand smoked, without so much as saying, By your leave. Had he known it\r\nwas impolite, he would have implored pardon, with many sweet-sounding\r\nwords. Mexican women smoke constantly, as men do and he does not\r\nknow better. He can live and does live on a dollar a week; and, with\r\n_tortillas_, onions, red pepper, and once in a great while a mutton\r\nstew, thrives and drives the ambulance. They say that there is Indian\r\nblood in him; that he is cold as death and treacherous as a tiger-cat;\r\nbut I do not believe it.\r\n\r\nIn this high, dry country, corresponding with Western Asia, the\r\ntendency of the human body is to Arab leanness, and Juan Fresco, who\r\ngrew to man’s estate under this fierce Syrian sun, sitting against the\r\nmud wall of a Syrian hut, has a soft Syrian face. No positive beauty\r\n(I have never seen out-door people except Arabs who have), but comely\r\nfeatures, unchanging, melancholy eyes, and a gentle, passive voice,\r\nvery winsome.\r\n\r\nThe festal day found Juan Fresco highly embellished with a yellow sash\r\ntied tightly around his waist, securing a long knife (_navaja_) in its\r\nfolds. Every Spaniard can use the knife with skill, and in his hands it\r\nbecomes a dreadful weapon. He can cast it with exact aim and unerring\r\ncertainty into a post or into the heart of an enemy at a considerable\r\ndistance away; and wherever there is Spanish blood the _navaja_ is the\r\nfavorite weapon, not always concealed about his person. Our muleteer\r\ntook his pleasure sadly as any Englishmen; but his sadness is only for\r\nstrangers. He is leader of the band which goes from house to house\r\nplaying under the windows--the sweet Spanish invitation to the ball;\r\ngayly thrums the guitar at the light fandango; and can dance till\r\nmorning as well as hold his own in any affray that may grow out of the\r\nwild license of the _baile_.\r\n\r\nOccasionally he leaped from his seat for a pocketful of stones,\r\ngathering them as the wagon moved on, and throwing them at the heads\r\nof the mules; at the same time muttering, on the ledger lines below,\r\nsacred words mixed with names of saints. The Mexican insists a mule\r\ncannot be made to understand without such urging; and they have a\r\nproverb: “An ass’s ears are made long in order to catch oaths.”\r\n\r\n[N. B.--There is reason to believe that a like superstition attaches to\r\nthe Army of the United States.]\r\n\r\nLeaving the venerable city of the Pueblos, we crossed the Santa Fé\r\nRiver, which in Indiana would be called a spring branch. I have often\r\ngone over it dry shod. But the poverty of the Spanish language allows\r\nonly one word for running water--_Rio_, translated river. The Santa Fé\r\nMountains round about us are a part of the great Rocky Mountain system,\r\nconnecting on the north with the Spanish Peaks and Raton Mountains,\r\nincluding many whose summits are silvered with perpetual snow. A\r\nseries of high, picturesque chains, in the morning-glow robed with a\r\ntransparent purple haze, of such exquisite tint one can hardly realize\r\nthose airy pyramids in a fair border-land between us and heaven are,\r\nindeed, upheavals of earth, veined with quartz and based on coarse red\r\ngranite.\r\n\r\nWords cannot picture aught so fair. The faintest violet, the softest\r\nheliotrope are coarse and hard beside the dreamy, poetic color, which\r\nappeals to the eye as dim æolian soundings touch the ear, charming the\r\nfancy with vague ideas of a viewless beauty within the floating veil.\r\n\r\nI cannot make you understand. Come and see the transfiguration which\r\nmakes rock-ribbed hills appear like tents of light, lovely enough for\r\nangels to rest in on their upward flight.\r\n\r\nThe plain was smooth as a prairie, and our road free of stone. The\r\nreader must not imagine it lay among Alpine scenery, with huge peaks\r\ntowering to the sky, forbidding our advance, yielding at last to reveal\r\nsmiling valleys and hidden hamlets, nestling close to the hillsides in\r\nnarrow glens. Here all is on the same magnificent scale. The plains\r\nare broad as the summits are high; the refined atmosphere so intensely\r\nclear the light is like a reflection from snow. No such extensive\r\nviews are in Europe or any country where the air holds moisture, and\r\nsometimes the landscapes seem absolutely limitless.\r\n\r\nThe Sierras are short, uneven spurs from the main line. They have\r\ndisturbed the overlying strata in the shape of _mesas_ (tables) of\r\nsolid rock, which are a distinguishing feature of Rocky Mountain\r\nscenery, giving it a grotesque, fantastic beauty. The process of\r\nerosion has formed in colossal size copies of the grandest structures\r\nof man’s art, and towering columns, temples with sharp pinnacles,\r\nscattered pillars rise abruptly from the centre of plains desolate and\r\nforsaken as the wilderness of Engedi--strange and solemn sights. In the\r\nPainted Desert are snow-white _mesas_, the _craie blanche_ composition\r\nof the chalk cliffs on the south coast of England, which dazzle the\r\neye, reflecting the sunlight like palaces of alabaster or of ice. The\r\nstone corridors of Karnak and Philae are the work of pigmies compared\r\nwith this noble architecture, wrought by slow processes in secret\r\nplaces,\r\n\r\n  “Made by Nature for herself.”\r\n\r\nSometimes the _mesa_ shapes into a rose-red wall, with fluted columns\r\nthat uphold the sky. Again it is a group of gray pyramids, a thousand\r\nor twelve hundred feet high; or an isolated, broken dome, worn smooth\r\nby the weather, picturesque in the extreme.\r\n\r\nNothing affords such changes of coloring as the variegated marls, lying\r\nin regular bands of red, orange, green, blue, of rainbow hue, striped\r\nand interstratified with belts of purple, bluish white, and mottled\r\nveins of exceeding richness.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, the traveler occasionally finds himself riding above\r\nthese singular formations, and looking _down_ on the “Painted Rocks.”\r\n\r\nThe sheer sides of a _mesa_ of gray limestone, mixed with blue clay\r\nand capped with a rim of pillared basalt, are singularly like fabrics\r\nof hewn stone. I have seen low walls of even height reaching long\r\ndistances, precisely like field-walls laid by skillful masons. These,\r\nin the neighborhood of stately _façades_, with the fair finish at the\r\ntop, explain how an explorer, afraid to make near approach, should go\r\naway and give accounts of vast cities, with gallant banners on the\r\nwalls enclosed in heavy outworks.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] Prescott’s _History of the Conquest of Mexico_, Vol. I.\r\n\r\n[15] Father Sahagun thus describes these precious stones: “_Las\r\nchalchuites son verdes y no transparentes mezcladas de blanco, usanlas,\r\nmucho las principales trayendolas las muñecas atadas en hilo, y aquello\r\nes señal de que es persona noble el que las trae._”--_Hist. de Nueva\r\nEspaña_, Lib. ii. chap. 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. TO THE TURQUOIS MINES. (_Continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\nTraveling westward, there came to our view the first Placer Mountain;\r\nbehind it the melon-shaped Sandia, 13,000 feet in air; and far\r\nsouthward the detached range of the Manzana Mountains. A plateau, the\r\nhighest of equal area on the globe, varied with sterile _vegas_ and\r\ndreary sierras, which reminded the early adventurers of their own Old\r\nCastile, and so like it one can imagine it had once been the home of\r\nwandering tribes, which have long since taken up their spears, struck\r\ntheir tents, and sought new camps in the furthest East.\r\n\r\nThe grama grass is low and dry, like wiry moss, and in the distance\r\ntakes a wan, ashen hue, more ghastly than white. The cactus is the only\r\nshrub in sight. A gaunt, starved thing, the leper of the vegetable\r\nworld, forbidding our approach.\r\n\r\nThe lively prairie dog (who is no dog, but a marmot) saluted as\r\nwe passed. Having early learned the fifth beatitude, I suppress a\r\ndescription of him. Nor shall we ask how he exists without water,\r\nor seek to know if there is a snake at the bottom of his den, and a\r\nstrange bird dwelling there in peace and safety.\r\n\r\nIt was June; but not the leafy month of June. The only timber--dwarf\r\ncedar--which can grow in this barren soil was cut away years ago; and\r\nabsence of trees includes absence of birds. The friendly trill and\r\nflutter heard about nests in shady places are sadly missed. Now and\r\nthen a black wing flapped overhead, and a crow flew down in the road.\r\nLiving equally well on seed, roots, flesh, he thrives alike in all\r\nplaces. And, except this one sign of life, we may journey in some\r\ndirections a whole day and see neither man nor beast, bird nor insect.\r\nWe missed the woodland scents, too; the forest fragrance of mint,\r\nthyme, pennyroyal, and the beeches, whose shadows are the curtains of\r\nthe morning, holding its freshness against the power of the sun till\r\nhigh noon. The eye soon wearies of the leaden hues, and longs for the\r\ndark leafage which is the glory of the Mississippi Valley. The blank,\r\nscorched plain, lying stark and still in the fierce, white light,\r\nbrought a sense of loneliness and depression impossible to shake off.\r\nThere was no rest for the sight or the soul.\r\n\r\nBut what is this apparition starting from a distant clump of\r\ngreasewood--a grisly animal, apparently neither brute nor human?\r\nRapidly coming toward us, we recognize a creature of the _genus homo_.\r\n“In the desert no one meets a friend,” says the Oriental proverb; and\r\nthere was a general stir for arms among the defenders, and mute shaking\r\nof the head, not intended to be seen, when nothing more serviceable\r\nthan a cactus cane was found in the ambulance.\r\n\r\nEvery reader knows the border is the chosen field of the dime-novel\r\nhero; a safe refuge for cut-throats and desperadoes of the lowest\r\ngrades, who live by robbery and plunder, and that it is wise for the\r\ntourist to put on his pistol with his watch, or, in the expressive\r\nslang of the frontier, he may be blighted by lead fever before sundown.\r\n\r\nOutlaws from Mexico and Texas haunt the mountain springs and prowl\r\nabout the cañons of the territories; and, in dread of them, hunters go\r\nin parties, and look well to their arms when they enter narrow defiles\r\nor a dark, lonesome gulch.\r\n\r\nThese vagabonds subsist on the fat of the land, where the country is\r\nmost sparsely settled, and are the only buyers who have credit and are\r\nnot crowded for payment by the Israelites who control the dry goods\r\nbusiness of the territory. The ranchero never refuses them milk, eggs,\r\nor mutton; and the dark-eyed Mexican girl serves them with diligence,\r\nunder promise of payment when they come again. Given a voice in the\r\nmatter, this is not such a character as we like to encounter on an\r\nempty plain, even in broad daylight; and, as he neared us, the ladies\r\ninvoluntarily drew close together and scanned him thoroughly.\r\n\r\nA powerful fellow, of giant frame and dangerous muscle, and, though\r\nunarmed, a foe to dread in any fight. He wore a shoddy coat, probably\r\nbought on compulsory credit of the Wandering Jew of Tularosa; buckskin\r\npants, with fringed side-stripes of Indian work, tucked inside of\r\nheavy cavalry boots, ponderous brass spurs jingling as he walked; a\r\nred cotton handkerchief knotted around his throat. An immense slouched\r\n_sombrero_--in the style of the Mexican _caballero_--drab, with a\r\nrosette and cord of red and tinsel, covered his forehead and shaded\r\neyes that were restless and penetrating like a blackbird’s. A shaggy,\r\nunshorn mane, reddened with dust and sunburn, fell over the buffalo\r\nneck and shoulders; matted beard, a very jungle, reached almost to the\r\ncartridge-belt, and, blown aside by the wind, revealed the outline of\r\nrevolvers in his breast-pockets. He carried a Winchester rifle easily\r\nas a gentleman carries his cane; a leather belt, buckled around his\r\nwaist, was filled with cartridges, and bore a murderous-looking knife\r\nin its sheath.\r\n\r\nWhen this shape, of aspect threatening and sinister, came within\r\nfriendly hail, we bowed with much suavity.\r\n\r\n“Texas Jack! _Buenos dias!_” said Juan Fresco, who well became his\r\nname; and serene as summer, he shifted the reins and laid his hand on\r\nthe _navaja_.\r\n\r\nThe frontiersman touched his hat-brim with his big forefinger, sunburnt\r\nto a vermilion red, quietly passed on toward the Galisteo, and we saw\r\nhim no more. When fairly out of sight of the outlaw, we felt brave as\r\nlions.\r\n\r\n“A prospector,” said one, mildly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and never without a prospect,” said the antiquarian, bringing out\r\nan old witticism.\r\n\r\n“A black sheep without any white spots,” added another. “They always\r\nspring up on the frontier.”\r\n\r\nAnd, very hilarious under the sense of relief, we courageously debated\r\nwhat we would have done had the robber attempted robbery and ordered\r\nus to hold up our hands. The men of the pen would have been mere boys\r\nin the grip of this son of the border; and we cheered ourselves with\r\ntelling tales of how “just such men” had gone out without pistols to\r\nseek their fortunes, and had never been heard of afterward.\r\n\r\nThe weakest of weeklies is dull and insipid compared with the daily\r\nexperiences recounted in New Mexico; and restless souls who hate\r\ntrammels, who love danger for its own sake, and have looked death in\r\nthe face till they cease to fear it, find a special charm in the wild\r\n“game flavor” of the frontier.\r\n\r\nThe borderer who crossed our path was the sort of soldier who in March,\r\n1862, under the rebel General Sibley, came up from Texas, forded the\r\nRio Grande at a point below Fort Craig, fought the Union troops under\r\nGen. Canby at Valverde, and again at Cañon Glorietta, fifteen miles\r\nfrom Santa Fé. In that narrow pass, where flanking was out of the\r\nquestion, a severe fight between infantry and artillery occurred, in\r\nwhich the rebels were victorious, and Sibley entered the capital city\r\nwithout meeting further resistance.\r\n\r\nHis Texan Rangers, like Texas Jack, were half savage; a desperate\r\nset, having no higher motive than plunder and adventure. Each one\r\nwas mounted on a mustang horse, and carried a rifle, a tomahawk, a\r\nbowie-knife, a pair of Colt’s revolvers, and a lasso for catching and\r\nthrowing the horses of a flying enemy. Not valuing their own lives at a\r\npin’s fee, they gave no quarter and expected none.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven o’clock the breeze dropped and the sun came up with a dry,\r\nsultry scorch, like flame. Our spirits flagged, the stories ended,\r\nlaughter and song died away; nor could we rouse to the least interest\r\nin a herdsman’s ranche--a mud-built hive, swarming with Mexican drones.\r\n\r\n“What a weary land!” said Thalia.\r\n\r\n“All lands are weary for women,” said her elder sister; and for a time\r\nnothing was heard but the harsh grinding of wheels in the gravelly sand.\r\n\r\nIn such emptiness it was a stirring event to be overtaken by a Pueblo\r\nIndian, who passed us with a swinging stride, rarely seen off the\r\nboards of a country theatre. This\r\n\r\n  “Wild warrior of the Turquois Hills”\r\n\r\nis tame enough now. Always a tiller of the soil, he is the original,\r\nin fact, the aboriginal granger. A picturesque figure, in a handsome\r\nstriped blanket, with red girth around his waist and a crown of\r\ngreen leaves, like the classic fillet, shading his forehead. We were\r\nfortunate, too, in seeing a half-grown boy chase jack-rabbits with\r\na curved stick, hurling it with whirring sound, in the style of the\r\nboomerang, till lately thought exclusively Australian. The stripling\r\nappeared like the bird-hunter of the Nile, carved in _basso relievo_\r\non the oldest tomb at Thebes. Weapon and attitude of the Egyptian are\r\nprecisely the same as those of the boyish red hunter of North America.\r\n\r\nThe more we learn of Eve’s family, the surer the proofs of a common\r\nparentage. Guided by the same instinct, the tools of various\r\nnations, unknown to each other, are the same and the measure of\r\ntheir advancement; showing how little depends on accident, and how\r\nclosely they are connected with the organism, and, therefore, with the\r\nnecessities of man. So striking is the parallel between aborigines in\r\nevery continent that with difficulty do we divest ourselves of the idea\r\nthat there must have been some direct intercommunication.\r\n\r\nA band of tender green, restful to the sight, follows the course of a\r\npoor, tired, sluggish stream, sixteen miles from Santa Fé; and a mile\r\nor two down its soundless current we described a group of cotton-wood\r\ntrees--an oasis, indeed--shading a low adobe house. The green leaves\r\nin restless flutter and the brook gave the spot an appearance of home\r\nnot often found in the square of brown mud wall which makes the Mexican\r\ndomicile.\r\n\r\nAlong the margin of the nameless stream is a border of alkali,\r\nsprinkled in patches like salt over the ground. Of course, we were\r\nstruck with thirst at sight of running water; but prudently contented\r\nourselves with that in our canteens, rather than risk drinking alkali,\r\nwhich abounds in New Mexico, so strong in some streams that fish cannot\r\nlive in them. In many places the ranchero digs, to find only a mocking\r\nfluid, deadly alike to man, beast, and vegetation. And we comprehend\r\nthe Arabian saying: “The water provider is always blest, being daily\r\nremembered in the prayers of the faithful.”\r\n\r\nOur road was an easy descent all the way, the Cerillos being nearly\r\n3,000 feet lower than Santa Fé. The founder of the antique city (Don\r\nAntonio de Espego) described this country with Spanish exuberance, in\r\na letter to Philip Second: “The earth is filled with gold, silver, and\r\nturquoises.” And the gallant adventurer threw such glowing light upon\r\nit, the king at once sent a thousand men to colonize and possess the\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nAs we quietly journeyed along, I pondered on the very moderate basis\r\nthe heroic Cavaliers, those old Spanish filibusters, had for the\r\nbrilliant reports sent back to Spain. Leaving the ambulance within a\r\nmile of the mines, we toiled wearily along the mountains, well named\r\nthe Rocky. Their surface is strewn with fragments, broken as if chipped\r\nwith hammers--a ragged pavement, which bruised our feet, tore our\r\nshoes, and wore out our patience; and when at last we reached the first\r\nmine, we thought it but a continuation of _Los Cerillos_. The most\r\nancient is much the largest, and to this we directed our steps. Under\r\nthe dizzy crags which overhang it is a sheltered recess, blackened\r\nwith smoke and bedded with ashes made by camp-fires of Indians, who\r\nstill frequent the spot, in search of the precious _chalchuite_. With\r\ndifficulty we reached this cave, and, leaning over the edge, looked\r\ndown and saw, not a narrow, black shaft, but half a mountain cut away.\r\nUndoubtedly, the mineral lay here which, through countless generations,\r\nfurnished the Indian kings with their most valued ornaments. The\r\nyawning pit is two hundred feet deep and more than three hundred in\r\ndiameter. Probably the work of aborigines before De Soto’s requiem\r\nmingled with the voice of the rushing waters of his burial place; when\r\nColumbus had seen the New World only in that vision of the night,\r\nwhere the unknown voice whispered: “God will cause thy name to be\r\nwonderfully resounded through the earth, and will give thee the keys\r\nof the gates of the Ocean, which are closed with strong chains.” On\r\nthe walls of the great excavation Nature has gently, patiently done\r\nwhat she could to smooth the rugged crags, and has thrown out of their\r\nfissures a scant growth of shrubs, and trailed a scarlet blossom here\r\nand there on a thread-like stem. At the bottom, on stones crumbling\r\nwith age, stained and weather-worn, are dwarf pines, the growth of the\r\ncenturies. In this close amphitheatre there is no breeze to stir their\r\ntops, and their motionless foliage, with its somber shadows, adds to\r\nthe ever-present mountain-gloom.\r\n\r\nThousands of tons of rock have been crushed from the solid mass, and\r\nthrown up in such a high heap it seems another mountain, overgrown\r\nwith old pines and dry gray mosses. On a few fragments we noticed the\r\nturquois stain--“indication” of valuable mineral. When we consider\r\nthat all this digging, hewing, and hacking were done by hand-labor\r\nalone, without knowledge of domestic animals, iron, or gunpowder, the\r\n_débris_ carried away in sacks of skins, the enormity of the work is\r\nthe more impressive. The tradition is that the _chalchuite_ mines,\r\nthrough immemorial ages known to the primitive race, were possessed\r\nby the Spaniards in the sixteenth century. Indian slaves then worked\r\nthem, under the lash of the conqueror, until 1680, when, by accident, a\r\nportion of the rock from which we had our first view fell, and killed\r\nthirty Pueblos. The Spaniards immediately made a requisition on the\r\ntown of San Marcos for more natives to take their places; when, with\r\na general uprising, they drove the hated oppressor from the country\r\nas far south as El Paso del Norte. I give the tale for what it is\r\nworth. Mining atmospheres are the favorite haunts of fable, and a\r\nspice of truth is enough to flavor whole volumes of stories, charming\r\nbut delusive. An airy legend hovers about Santa Fé that two stones\r\nfrom “_La Canada de las Minas_”--“Glen of Mines”--are still among the\r\ncrown jewels of Arragon. But _chalchuites_ were valueless after being\r\nonce submitted to the jewelers of Spain; and the sparkling story, like\r\nmany another told by the camp-fire, loses its original brightness when\r\nremoved to the searching light of the student’s lamp.\r\n\r\nCareful analysis shows the constituents of the _chalchuites_ are nearly\r\nthe same as those of the Persian turquoises, and their formation the\r\nresult of infiltration. Sometimes they are washed up by heavy rains;\r\nbut usually are discovered by digging in the sandstone or are broken\r\nout from the body of the rock.\r\n\r\nNot being disposed to dig, we retraced our path, and climbed around to\r\nthe top of the shelving crag above us, and looked over the plateau.\r\nEastwardly it stretches toward Santa Fé, beyond which the stony\r\nmountains lift their high heads. On the southwest it opens toward\r\nthe Rio Grande in a measureless vista, where earth and sky appear to\r\nmeet. A plain, oppressive in its vastness, lying in the midst of a\r\nstone wilderness, its sameness relieved by the solitary peaks, Sandia\r\nand Albuquerque. In every direction stand mountains grim and fixed as\r\nwalls of adamant, apparently immovable as the throne of God. Low in the\r\nhorizon one feathery cloud hung moveless in a sapphire sky. The world\r\nseemed stricken dead. No verdure to cool the parched grass; no water,\r\n“the eye of the earth” glancing up toward heaven; no waving branches,\r\nbeckoning like friendly hands to cool shade and shelter: no wagon-road\r\nor foot-path to mark the track of men; not a sound to break a\r\nstillness which is not the hush of profound peace, but the everlasting\r\nsilence of death.\r\n\r\nSave the one shining spot of gauzy vapor, the blue above was without\r\na blur. The sun was at meridian, and in its hard glitter the scorched\r\nsummits looked like they were at white heat. The sea is lonely; but\r\nit has shifting color, sound, and motion. The silence of the land is\r\ndeeper. If there had been the note of a bird, the hum of bees, even\r\na grasshopper’s chirp, it had been a relief; but in the far-reaching\r\ndesolation I alone drew breath. All else was still as the breast when\r\nthe spirit has fled.\r\n\r\nThe influence was benumbing to the senses, and as I stood in infinite\r\nsolitude, a stone among stones, there came over me the feeling that\r\nthis melancholy waste is the skeleton of our Mother Earth; that the\r\ndust of which all flesh is made has been blown away, scattered to the\r\nfour winds of heaven, leaving these gray old bones forlorn and unburied\r\nthrough the long, slow centuries, till the coming of the Great Day for\r\nwhich all other days were made.\r\n\r\nThe voices below were too remote for my hearing, and (how absurd it now\r\nappears) it was “company” to spy a speckled chameleon, sunning himself\r\non a rock; and, as he quickly slipped between its cracks and vanished,\r\nI was left the more alone. Listening to silence, as it were, there\r\nswept across my memory the words of the hymn familiar in childhood as\r\nthe dear face which bent above my cradle:\r\n\r\n  “O’er all these wide-extended plains\r\n   Shines one eternal day.”\r\n\r\nIf the singer had ever faced the blinding glare of high noon on the\r\nwide-extended plains of the Rocky Mountains, he would have tuned his\r\nharp anew, and hymned the rivers of waters in a dry place, the shadow\r\nof a great rock in a weary land.\r\n\r\nI soon sought that refuge from the desert scorch, and, snatching at\r\nshrubs to keep from slipping, scrambled down the mountain by a dizzy,\r\nwinding way, the loosened stones rolling after me to the bottom of the\r\nmine. How pleasant the smoke of the camp-fire! Its leaping flame and\r\ncrackle were a welcome back to life again. And never till then did I\r\nknow how much sweeter than harp or horn the sound of human voices can\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nLong before I joined my companions I had heard shouts of exultation,\r\nand, wondering what prospector had “struck it,” I learned that a piece\r\nof _chalchuite_ had been brought out of the lining of a seam where it\r\nhad lain under the roots of a stunted shrub, in appearance not unlike\r\nspicewood. It was near an inch in length, by half an inch in thickness;\r\na large and lovely specimen, the color sea-green, delicately shaded\r\ninto blue--the latter the result of decomposition, so the scientist\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThe owner of this “regular bonanza” was our driver. He made no effort\r\nto conceal his delight; and with reason, for it was a rare piece of\r\nmineral, and he a lucky miner to obtain it with so little trouble, or\r\neven to get it at all. Such a stone the gentle and gracious Montezuma\r\nmight have worn in his signet-ring or set in the clasp of his green\r\nmantle of feather-work. Such a gift would have made still brighter\r\nthe bright eyes of his daughter, the laughing Princess Nenetzin, the\r\nspoiled darling, whose death was the crowning horror of the _Noche\r\nTriste_.\r\n\r\nI had sniffed coffee from afar, and now we were ready to pass the cup\r\nthat not inebriates, sung by the temperate Cowper. Our cloth was laid\r\non a table-rock, the feast was spread, we ate, drank, and were merry.\r\nThe dumb spell of the desert snapt, only the peace of the perpetual\r\nhills remained. Resting in the fragrant shade of the pines, we talked\r\nof Montezuma, the saddest, proudest chief of Indian history, whose name\r\nis still a majestic memory among the degraded, broken-hearted Pueblos.\r\n\r\nBeautiful beliefs they cherish regarding him--the peculiar friend of\r\nthe red race, shadowy above all things, yet real above all things, who\r\ndwelt among them as a god, yet a familiar friend. He was the brother\r\nand equal of the Unseen One whose name it is death to utter; and the\r\nchiefs still watch for him at sunrise beside the sacred fire in the\r\n_estufa_, claiming his promise to come again from his throne in the\r\nsun, and bring back the faded glories of his fallen people. All their\r\ntraditions point to the second advent of their beloved prophet, priest,\r\nand king, who disappeared from the earth when it was young, and who\r\nwill not fail, in the fullness of time, to redeem the promise made to\r\nhis red children.\r\n\r\nThe ground was strewn with fragments of broken pottery, the unfailing\r\nsign of the ancient Pueblo, the rightful owner of this soil. They\r\nwere colored maroon red, light clay, and dark brown, with markings\r\nof black. At sight of them the antiquarian fell to wandering among\r\ntombs, discoursing on fallen kingdoms, extinct races, wrecks of empire,\r\nand columns voiceless as the gray stones of Pæstum. He was learned\r\nand eloquent; but none of these things move me. Our little scraps\r\nwere but the elder and better counterparts of the poor potteries\r\nthe Pueblos make at this day; and merely prove, what I believe has\r\nnever been disputed, that North America has been inhabited from a\r\nremote period. I know there are enthusiasts who insist there was a\r\nprehistoric race, displaced by what we call aborigines, which had a\r\ncivilization comparing favorably with those of the Old World. What\r\nthat civilization was, let the stone hatchet, and the dingy pottery\r\nwith its graceless tracings testify, when laid beside relics from\r\nEturia the Beautiful. The Western fragments are in beggarly contrast\r\nwith the exquisite vases and jewel-work which are the model and despair\r\nof the modern artist.\r\n\r\nSeveral inferior bits of _chalchuite_ were dug out of the ancient\r\nwastage; but the color was faint, as if they had not lain long enough\r\nfor a thorough dyeing. We added to our collection an arrowhead of\r\njasper and one of obsidian, nicely flaked and pointed; and gave a\r\ndollar for the largest Indian hatchet I have ever seen, brought up by\r\nthe enterprising Juan Fresco from an abandoned silver mine hard by. It\r\nwas roughened and time-worn, and had lain there how long--ah! _Quien\r\nsabe?_\r\n\r\nIt may interest some believer in the perishing theory of “Ages” to\r\nknow the Stone Age is not ended in New Mexico. Within the present\r\ngeneration, it is said, remote tribes have used as a weapon, offensive\r\nand defensive, the stone hatchet, tied by a thong of deer-skin to a\r\nwooden handle. As Sir John Herschel said of something else, this is one\r\nof those things which, according to received theories, ought not to\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\nWe lingered under the solemn pines, groping with shadows, visible and\r\nunseen, loth to leave. The hoary hills, so lone and untrodden, began\r\nto be possessed of strange enchantment. The place was ours by right of\r\ndiscovery. We were a band of explorers, the first to break a silence\r\nlasting since the morning stars sang at creation’s dawn. Perhaps the\r\nwitchery was a variation of the prevalent miner’s fever, for the day\r\nwas waning when we reluctantly gave over our search for precious\r\nmineral.\r\n\r\nIn the shining of the loveliest afterglow this side of Heaven, we\r\nsought the wagon, standing in the level expanse, like a ship at anchor.\r\nA freshening breeze blew cheerily, and, turning back as we drove away,\r\nwe watched the swift-coming Night gather the mountains tenderly, one\r\nby one, into her bosom, and touch their scarred, stern faces with\r\nineffable beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. TO THE TURQUOIS MINES, (_Continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth of the Placer Ridges and divided from them by the intervening\r\nvalley of the Galisteo, are bold bluffs of trap, the cut edges of a\r\nplateau forming a _mesa_, from which rise the volcanic cones of Los\r\nCerillos. From these hills rushed the fiery lava-flow widespread over\r\nthe country, giving it a worn-out look, desert-like and depressing\r\nto the last degree. Geologists assert that, at a very recent period\r\nin the world’s changes, fire, ice, and water have, with tremendous\r\nsubterranean forces, left here marks of a storm more terrible than our\r\nconceptions of the Deluge. The hot springs, now slowly dying out, are\r\nthe last of the series of events once performed on a scale which almost\r\nbaffles human conception. The faint departing remnants of once terrific\r\nforces point to something which must be described by a broader word\r\nthan earthquake--a fiery convulsion, that altered the whole face of the\r\ncountry, if we may judge by the marks the storm has left.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid a rocky unheaval, thrown out by the expiring energies\r\nof the volcanic epoch, not yet closed, we started back to Santa Fé by\r\na circuitous route, and soon came on signs of a camp--heaps of white\r\nashes, circled by burnt and blackened ends of piñon chips. The _vega_\r\nis sere and parched as the plains of Arabia, and in dreamy mood we\r\ncould easily fancy the last tent of the Moslem had just been struck,\r\nthe heavy standard folded by slim figures in sweeping burnous; and we\r\nglanced along the horizon for a gleam of slender spears, and the long\r\ncaravan, made spectral by distance, slowly vanishing into the mystic\r\nsilence of the desert.\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily we looked for valuables dropped by Haroun and Mohammed,\r\nas they untethered the camels and packed the hampers; scattered spices;\r\na jeweled cup of gold, with the lump of ambergris at the bottom; a\r\nwhite turban; a shawl of price.\r\n\r\nNo such thing.\r\n\r\nThere lay on the ground, instead, a battered sardine-box, a sliver\r\nof wagon-tongue, the broken end of a saw (pocketed by Juan Fresco),\r\nfour greasy cards (also appropriated by Cool John), two used-up\r\npaper collars, and an empty black bottle. Strong testimonials to the\r\nhigh superiority of our arts, and the refinements of our boasted\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nA little way from the road, fastened to a scrubby piñon tree, was a\r\nfluttering white signal; and, thinking it might be a sign of distress,\r\nwe stopped the willing mules, and all got out to see what was the\r\nmatter. With the help of a match, we made out a rudely penciled hand\r\non canvas of flour-bag, pointing in the direction of Los Cerillos, and\r\nbelow it read the bold legend,--\r\n\r\n  “SWEET HOME SALOON.”\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, we hailed Sweet Home itself. A roofless pen of pine\r\nboughs, fencing in narrow shelves of black bottles, and a camp-stool--a\r\ndark puzzle made of mule-bones and cowhide, pronounced a relic of\r\nthe palæozoic age by the geologist. The establishment was guarded\r\nby a wolfish dog, which the bravest of us did not care to examine;\r\nso we hurried back to the ambulance, regardless of prickly pear,\r\nand in the valley’s edge passed the white tents of the vanguard\r\nof civilization--an army of laborers, working day and night on\r\nthe railroad track. They will not march till they have broken the\r\nfascinating spell, the poetic glamor which the romantic Espego threw\r\nover Nueva Espagna three hundred years ago, and which has rested on\r\nit like an alluring mystery ever since. If you would dream dreams\r\nand see visions, now is the time to come. If you would taste the\r\nwild charm, hasten to catch it before the wear of every-day travel\r\ntramples out the primitive customs. It is still to a good degree a\r\ncountry apart from the rest of the United States; mountain-locked and\r\nlittle known, severed, as it has been, from the great highways of\r\ncommerce. Its history is a romance and a tragedy, and, as in every\r\ncountry imperfectly explored, it holds more or less of the mysterious.\r\nHere are extensive ruins; unparalleled natural phenomena; mountains,\r\n“flaunting their crowns of snow everlastingly in the face of the sun,”\r\nthat bear in their bosom undeveloped mines, dazzling the imagination;\r\ncañons with perpendicular sides a mile in height; savages merciless and\r\nbloodthirsty, who in undying hate still dispute the progress of foreign\r\ncivilization. But the civilizer is coming; is here. The waste lands of\r\nthe wandering tribes will be divided and sold by the acre, instead of\r\nthe league. The dozing Mexican will be jostled on the elbow, and will\r\nwake from his long trance to find himself in the way.\r\n\r\nA procession of phantoms is flying along “_El Camino del ferro\r\ncarril_”; whispering voices are drowned in the hiss of steam; and the\r\nmidnight hush of the black cañon is stirred by the whirr of beautiful\r\nwings, unheard save by ears attuned to finest harmonies. By the time\r\nthis letter reaches the eyes so dear to the writer, there will be no\r\nhaunted solitudes along Los Cerillos. The pick and shovels of Mike\r\nBrady and the O’Flannegans will have put to flight the finer fancies of\r\nmusing antiquary and dreaming pilgrim. You know certain boundaries mark\r\nthe limit of every created thing, be it real or imaginary.\r\n\r\nFairies never trip it on pavements. They are too delicate for such\r\nfooting. Ghosts haunt only houses where men have lived and died; and\r\nthe epic of history cannot abide the screech of the locomotive nor\r\nits penetrating headlight. It requires broken, disconnected threads,\r\ndoubtful testimony, dim lights--above all, the misty lines of distance.\r\nThe locomotive brings the ends of the earth together, and dashes into\r\nnothingness delicate tissues woven in darkness, like certain delicate\r\nlaces, whose threads break in the weaving by day.\r\n\r\nAnd here is something brought by the locomotive.\r\n\r\nIn the luminous haze of the paling twilight appeared a peddler, lying\r\nbeside his pack, sheltered by a rock, under which he had crept, which\r\nlooked as though it might fall any moment and crush him to atoms. On\r\nnearer view, we discovered, instead of peddler and pack, the pioneer\r\norgan grinder, the first to set foot in New Mexico. His shoes were\r\nragged and travel-worn. He wore a cast-off uniform of army blue, and\r\na red handkerchief knotted round his throat. Sun-scorched gray hair\r\nstraggled round the edge of his black skull-cap, and mingled with the\r\ndust of the ground. Overcome by heat and fatigue, he was dead asleep,\r\none hand resting on the rusty green curtain which draped the organ,\r\nthe other holding the neck of a little brown dog, about the size of a\r\npinch of snuff, curled up in his bosom. In the emptiness of the desert\r\nevery peaceful thing is welcome. We stopped, as a matter of course.\r\n\r\n“A bad place for a tramp, unless he can eat rock and drink mirage,”\r\nsaid our polyglott antiquary, as he jumped from the ambulance. He shook\r\nthe sleeper gently, and addressed him in Italian. The man slowly rose\r\nto his feet. “Ah! excellenza,” said he, in the spoken music of Southern\r\nItaly, “your voice is like the sound of fountains in the ear of the\r\nthirsty. Tell me, is there no water in this land?”\r\n\r\n“None within six miles; but we have a canteen left, which you may\r\nhave,” and the kindly antiquary produced the dirty frontier flask,\r\nsewed up in flannel, to keep its contents cool--which it never does.\r\n\r\nThe musician unscrewed the lid, and took a long draught.\r\n\r\n“It is better than wine,” he said, “for Victor can drink it too,” and\r\nhe poured the precious liquid in a tin cup. The little brute, who was\r\npretty much all tail, gave a friendly bark, and wagged himself almost\r\nto pieces as he slaked his thirst.\r\n\r\n“Where are you going?” we asked.\r\n\r\n“To Albuquerque, to Bernalillo, to Las Lunas”--and he named the various\r\ntowns and stations on the route to Old Mexico.\r\n\r\n“The country is overrun by Apaches--Indians who will torture you and\r\nthen kill you.”\r\n\r\n“The banditti will not hurt,” said the old man, simply, “when I give\r\nthem this.”\r\n\r\nHe lifted the box to its one leg, raised the curtain, turned the crank;\r\na warning click, and lo! “Hear me, Norma.” How strangely the familiar\r\nair sounded across that plain, so wide, so dim, so still! Through a\r\nfloating mist, not of the earth or of the sky, I saw, not the wanderer\r\nand his wretched instrument, but a radiant vision of glittering lights,\r\nthe brilliant crowd in the horseshoe curve, hanging breathless on the\r\nvoice of the divine singer, now leading the starry choir of Heaven.\r\n\r\nSurely, there is not another place in the world where a party of\r\nsensible people would fool away an hour on an organ-grinder. Every\r\nwell-regulated mind (and I address no other) will perceive the\r\nabsurdity. But it was so long since we had heard one, he was such a\r\ndelightful reminder of bright days and brighter nights, that over and\r\nover again we made the drowsy player drone his dull tunes. They brought\r\nus serene and golden Italy, the racing shadows and glancing sunbeams of\r\nthe far Campania; and, best of all, the love-songs of home--that sweet\r\nspot, toward which I look as the first woman, exiled forever, must have\r\nlooked toward the barred gates of lost Paradise.\r\n\r\nWhen the wheezy machine rested, we gave the player a small (very small)\r\nfortune in loose change and the remnants of our lunch. He had only\r\na cracker and two onions in his wallet, and the wayfarer would have\r\nknelt for gratitude, had we allowed it, while he rained blessings on\r\nour heads, in the name of the Queen of Heaven, the saints, and all the\r\nangels.\r\n\r\n“Where do you camp?” asked the antiquary, when the benediction slacked.\r\n\r\n“Wherever the night finds me. I have a blanket, Victor is company, and\r\nthe sky is my tent.”\r\n\r\nThere was infinite pathos in the words and his glance up to the arch\r\noverhead. The flash of hero’s armor in the changeful curtains of\r\nthe glorious tent warned us to go on; but we were slow to leave the\r\nstranger, and would have taken him with us, but the ambulance was\r\nalready over-loaded.\r\n\r\nHe stood bareheaded long as we were in sight, lazily grinding “The\r\nLast Rose of Summer,” as though he was falling asleep. Faint and clear\r\nthe music drifted after us, by distance mellowed into sweetness. Miles\r\naway, now lost in the valley, now low on the hills, floated\r\n\r\n  “Tufts of tune like thistle-down,”\r\n\r\nwafted along by the soft night-breeze. When the last wandering note\r\ndied away we took up the refrain “Oh! who would inhabit this cold world\r\nalone?” and, looking at the sentinel stars, thought pityingly of the\r\nexile, alone in his tent--a mighty pavilion of royal purple, which\r\ndeepening shadows widened into a solitude vast as eternity, mysterious\r\nas death.\r\n\r\nThe singing was very soft, for Thalia was crying, as we discovered by\r\ntiny sniffs muffled behind her hankerchief, and you know how contagious\r\nhome-sickness is, and the sweeping gloom was oppressive even with the\r\nbest company. The cheerful day, with all its trailing splendors, was\r\ndead; the fine gold of sunset became dross. A pale, white shining\r\nin the east announced the rising moon, and in its mystic glow the\r\nmountains put on spectral shapes and journeyed with us. A solemn\r\nstillness filled the night and rested on the party which had set out\r\nso gayly in the morning. One by one the voices hushed, and silence\r\nfollowed, so intense it was almost painful.\r\n\r\nWe will anticipate, as our friends the novelists say, and follow\r\nthe march of the minstrel--one of the last of the gentle race of\r\ntroubadours. We heard of his safe arrival at Albuquerque and at\r\nBernalillo. Two days’ journey southward, the mail-boy reported having\r\nseen him, moving in a dazed, bewildered way, mourning for the little\r\ndoggie, which was missing. “There are no sausage factories here,” said\r\nour informant, with a smile of ghastly significance. “But a big Mexican\r\ndog could swallow that pup like a pill.”\r\n\r\nA lively letter from a friend in Silver City recorded his passage\r\nthrough the lower country. The Pueblo Indians gave him of their poor\r\nsubstance, and made him at home in their mud hovels, regarding him as\r\na great medicine-man, with a magic box. In their childish curiosity,\r\nthey wanted to chop open the cage and see the singing-birds inside. At\r\na little village, whose name I do not now recall, the whole population\r\nflocked round the itinerant. He was a choice item for the local editor\r\nof the _Pharos of the Occident_, a miner living on imagination, who\r\nfancied himself a brilliant writer and financier, and in a lurid\r\neditorial he hailed the musician as the forerunner of Thomas and\r\nMapleson, and hinted it was high time to form a stock company for the\r\npurpose of building an adobe opera-house. Everywhere the player was\r\nwell received, till he reached Socorro. On the edge of the Jornado,\r\nfrom immemorial ages overrun by the Apache, the Western Bedouin, every\r\ntrace of him was lost.\r\n\r\nThe tameless warriors of Victorio’s band are deaf to “Hear me, Norma,”\r\nand I greatly fear the gray scalp of the minstrel is a trophy in the\r\nbelt of the red chief, and that his poor old bones lie unburied in\r\nthe treeless, waterless, wind-swept desert, truly named, by the first\r\nSpaniard who dared its perils, _Jornada del Muerto_--Journey of Death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. TO THE TURQUOIS MINES, (_Continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\nAt evening the gentle shepherd of New Mexico leads his flock from\r\nhigh pastures, where the precipitation of moisture is greatest and,\r\ntherefore, grass is freshest, to the fold, or corral, in the valley.\r\nIt is precisely the pattern of fold abounding in Palestine and still\r\nto be seen on the outskirts of Alexandria--an enclosure made by\r\ncrooked stakes driven in the ground, poorly held together by strips of\r\nrawhide. No two are of the same length. All were twisted and gnarled\r\nin the growing, and lean out of the perpendicular. A shabby fence,\r\nuglier than everything except a mud fence, which the reader knows\r\nis the superlative ugliness. By the light of the moon we noted the\r\nfashion of the shepherd’s Cain-and-Abel suit of goatskin; and, instead\r\nof the classic crook, wreathed with garlands gathered in flowery\r\nmeadows, the Rocky Mountain Endymion guarded his flock with a shotgun\r\nand bowie-knife, less fearful of the wolf than of his own thieving\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nWe observe another Asian custom here, that of sleeping on the roofs in\r\nsummer. The heavenly nights invite one out, and the flat housetop is a\r\nmuch pleasanter place to make one’s bed than the cellar-like interior,\r\nwith its earthly scents. The sluggard Mexican, who has killed the long\r\nhours of the common enemy by dozing in the sun, rouses toward sunset\r\nand spreads out the _colchon_, or wool mattress, if they are very poor,\r\nor a bed of skins. The stairway is a rickety ladder, leaning against\r\nthe outer wall of the mud house, and the rapidity and ease with which\r\nthe natives go up and down is surprising. I have seen women carry jars\r\nof water on their head, not spilling a drop, as they ascend the ladder,\r\ntouching it only with their feet. The old people--mummies of the\r\ntime of Cheops--go to bed at sunset; a little later the children and\r\nchickens hop up the loose rounds; then the lord of the estate, and his\r\ndusky spouse, with her cat; and lastly the ratty dogs, moving nimbly,\r\nas the trained ones of the circus. Haul up the ladder, and the castle\r\nis secure. There is no fear of rain. There is no dew, no fog or mist,\r\nto blur the clear shining of the stars above. The low wind is the very\r\nbreath of heaven; the bright night is filled with sleep.\r\n\r\nSo slept the Saviour of the world on the housetop of Lazarus, at\r\nBethany, whither he had walked in the cool of the day. Looking from\r\nthat lowly bed toward the many mansions of his Father’s house, well\r\nmight the homeless guest utter the pathetic cry: “The foxes have holes\r\nand the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man hath not where\r\nto lay his head.”\r\n\r\nNear the City of the Pueblos, within sight of the graceful spire of\r\nthe Sisters’ Chapel, was a coyote tearing a stray lamb to pieces. We\r\nhad met the ninety-and-nine an hour before, returning to the fold from\r\nthe river. The wild, tameless creature there was in perfect keeping\r\nwith the continued newness of a country where white men have lived\r\nnearly three centuries. He started, looked fearlessly out of the\r\nsage-bush, and the clear moonlight outlined the true wolf’s head, with\r\nits fox-like muzzle and sharp, forward-pointed ears. He glared at us\r\na moment, and then quietly and leisurely stalked away, amid a general\r\nlament that we had neither gun nor pistol at hand. The beast was of the\r\n“Æsop’s Fable” breed--a large, handsome fellow, whose pictorial pelt\r\nwould have made an elegant foot-rug.\r\n\r\nLet me not close without idling what became of the “regular bonanza.”\r\nThe day after our return to Santa Fé, the many-named Mexican called,\r\nbringing his fine _chalchuite_. He explained, with impressive gesture\r\nand rhetorical flourish, he was too poor to own so rich a jewel,\r\nfit for the king’s son, and would sell it, if _la Senora_ would pay\r\nhim--naming the price. At first I was appalled at the magnitude of the\r\nsum; but the stone of inimitable hue, lying in the lean, brown hand,\r\nhad a sort of magnetism. The familiar tint was charming, matching as\r\nit did a tiny ring long worn for remembrance, and with much cracked\r\nSpanish and broken English, a bargain was made, and we parted, with\r\nmany a cordial _adios_. No, not even in the close confidence of print\r\nwill I tell you, beloved, the price of the princely jewel. The secret\r\nwill go with me to the grave. Enough that it was exhaustive. I am\r\nblushing over it yet.\r\n\r\nThe following week I heard a low whisper that Juan Fresco did not\r\nfind the turquois at _Los Cerillos_; but got it in a trade with a\r\nwild savage, ignorant of its worth. A Navajo, allowed to leave the\r\nReservation, under protection of a pass, and pay a stealthy visit to\r\nhis own hunting-grounds, had let it go for four yards of red flannel.\r\nCool John had slyly arranged the whole affair, and whisked the stone\r\nout of his sleeve in the very nick of time. Fortune turned his head,\r\nas she has many a stronger one. He retired from the box, and set up a\r\nsaloon, the “San Francisco,” under a bower of cedar boughs, in the near\r\nmining camp. Being of a convivial turn, in spite of mournful eyes and\r\nvoice, at last accounts, Juan Fresco was his own best customer at the\r\nbar.\r\n\r\nHowever, I had my costly prize, and in the seclusion of my own room\r\ngloated over it, and fearful of burglars, hid it at night under the\r\nedge of the carpet behind the bureau. After much deliberation regarding\r\nthe shape in which it would best appear, I sent the _chalchuite_ to\r\nthe leading jeweler of New York. Too precious for the mail, it went\r\nexpress, and I carefully held a receipt for its full value. In good\r\ntime the little lavender-box returned by mail. I untied the string with\r\nnervous haste and lo! my pattern locket lapped in red cotton, and the\r\n“regular bonanza.”\r\n\r\nA brief note explained Messrs. B. & B’s “regret to state the sample of\r\nturquois will not endure polish or cutting. The color is a mere surface\r\nstain on gneiss, and easily scales off, exposing the brown stone, as\r\nyou may readily discover by trying it with your scissors-point. We\r\nhave received several such specimens from New Mexico. They have no\r\ncommercial value. This has none whatever, except to its owner.”\r\n\r\nThen I felt like the tender poet who sends off a song that is his\r\nheart’s delight, and receives next week a very precious letter, in\r\nfamiliar handwriting, accompanied by a printed circular, bearing the\r\nawful words, “Declined, with thanks.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYesterday I examined a collection of relics--not exquisitely beautiful,\r\nbut exquisitely old--from various points along the valleys of the San\r\nPedro, the Gila, and the Rio Grande. They were mainly broken potteries,\r\na few sacred whispering-stones from old _estufas_, rude arms of\r\n_iztli_, and the familiar flint arrows, such as have been discovered\r\nin every portion of the globe where there are graves of men. Among\r\nmany trinkets offered, I chose a little looking-glass of _iztli_, and\r\nan amulet of _chalchuite_ from the ruins of a prehistoric city near\r\nEl Paso. It was close to the Texas line, and within the limit of the\r\nmound-builders’ region. I selected these trifles because they were\r\nfeminine belongings, and brought me nearer than the pipes and hatchets\r\ncould bring me to my dead and gone sisters. The mirror, about half the\r\nsize of your hand, is made of _iztli_, or obsidian, an exceedingly\r\nhard, vitreous substance, plentiful in volcanic countries, of smoky\r\ntint, and capable of high polish. The art of working this intractable\r\nmaterial is practically lost in our times, but when wrought by the\r\nIndigene was useful as iron or tempered steel.[16]\r\n\r\nThe amulet and twenty beads of _chalchuite_ were hidden in a black\r\nglazed jar, of the shape made by natives to-day, buried in a cave\r\nmany feet below the surface of the ground. It was accidentally\r\nopened, in 1878, by a party of miners digging for silver. Probably\r\na treasure-house, abandoned at the last moment, when the besieged\r\ninhabitants fled before a victorious army. Stone hammers were found\r\nnear the cave, arrow-heads, hatchets, serrated swords of _iztli_, like\r\nthe Aztecan, and half a human skull, evidently broken by a blow of the\r\nhatchet or tomahawk.\r\n\r\nThe amulet is perhaps half an inch long, one-eighth of an inch\r\nthick--an irregular square, rudely carved and smoothed, probably by\r\nrubbing with another stone. The veining on one side gives the semblance\r\nof a star. A hard tool and patient hand must have been required to\r\ndrill a hole through this stubborn stone. The string which threaded it\r\nhas gone to dust; the hand which carved it and the race of which it\r\nis a faint trace are vanished into the voiceless past. Long lines of\r\nprostrate walls, miles of _acequias_, or irrigating ditches, broken\r\npotteries, profusely scattered, indicate a dense population once\r\nheld the valley near El Paso, and lived in cities containing twenty\r\nthousand or thirty thousand souls. There is no reason to believe the\r\nmodern inhabitants of this country belong to a proud line, shorn of its\r\nancient splendors. They have no sort of history, and among a people\r\nwithout written language, poetry, or music, tradition soon becomes\r\nconfused. All their remains and three hundred years of continuous\r\nhistory show they have steadily declined in power and numbers; but\r\nthey are and have always been miserably poor. Their fabrics, arms,\r\narchitecture are of the coarsest, most primitive description.\r\n\r\nThe vessels of silver and of gold described by early explorers to\r\na waiting and expectant world have not been found in this or any\r\nother spot in New Mexico. They existed only in the fevered fancies\r\nof adventurers, blinded by their own imaginings, drunk with their\r\nown conceits. If metals we count valuable were concealed in the\r\nancient treasure-house, they are lost in the deep grave with the dead\r\ncenturies. Only these trifling memorials have escaped the common doom.\r\n\r\nMy amulet is a sorry love-token; yet, for the sake of the soft meaning\r\nit once bore, I touch the trinket lightly. Rude in outline, utterly\r\nlacking in grace and luster, it represents a Western idyl.\r\n\r\nYoung were the lovers, I know (for love is ever young), and to eyes\r\nbeloved each was beautiful and true. Perhaps she stood like Ruth among\r\nthe corn, as the warm blood flushed his face, when he bound it with his\r\nlove as a crown unto her, fastening it with vows, and promises, and\r\nnever-ending kisses. Or did he set it as a seal upon her arm, making\r\nits pulses beat fast to a new music, under the secret magic of its\r\ncircle? Or was it hung on her neck, above the heart which fluttered\r\nlike a caught bird at its touch, in the hour which comes but once in\r\na lifetime? Ah, well you know, gentle reader, how she cherished the\r\nkeepsake, and pondered it over when his face was not there, little\r\ndreaming how one of a race unheard of should, centuries afterward,\r\ndream over it too, and call back her spirit from out the unrecorded\r\npast, her gracious presence and tender words.\r\n\r\nAll, all gone now. My young mound-builders--if mound-builders they\r\nwere--sleep with the primeval giants. And, while a thousand wonderments\r\nhover about the poor keepsake, this only we do know: that they walked\r\nblindly along the path we call life; slowly, and with many a failure,\r\nworked out their destiny. They loved, sinned and suffered, died, and\r\nwere forgotten. The surface of the country is altered since that old\r\nlove-making. Strong cities are leveled with the plains, tribes are\r\nscattered, languages lost, whole races are extinct; but humanity\r\nremains the same--the one thing that will outlast the world. These\r\ndead-and-gone tribes were not foreign to us. They were of our own\r\nblood, our elder brethren; and as their names and deeds are blotted\r\nout, leaving not a memory, so we are moving forward in the resistless\r\nmarch, holding in our hands messages appealing to futurity--messages\r\naddressed to darkness, dropped into oblivion.\r\n\r\nThe relics from the Rio Grande were buried down deep. Perhaps my young\r\nlovers whispered the sweet words which made Eden Paradise, before\r\nthe witching eyes of Marie Stuart turned the hearts of men; before\r\nCleopatra shone; before Lucretia spun. The _chalchuite_ might lie in\r\nthis rare, dry air till the crack of doom and suffer no change, as our\r\nold earth swings through the constellations, year by year. Possibly,\r\nits wearer was contemporary with the man of Natchez, whose bones were\r\nexhumed not long ago, under the Mississippi bluffs, in strata said to\r\nprove him not less than one hundred thousand years old.\r\n\r\nIf the story were told, we might not care to know what manner of man\r\nthe bygone mound-builder was. His history must have been one of wars,\r\nand the struggles of the chiefs were trivial and petty to that of\r\nmighty Hector and Agamemnon, if we accept the testimony of the remains\r\nwhich still exist. Let us believe we lost no grand epic in the Iliad of\r\nthe lost race.\r\n\r\nThe great historian wisely says: “The annals of mankind have never\r\nbeen written, can never be written, nor would it be within the limits\r\nof human capacity to read them, if they were written. We have a leaf\r\nor two torn from the great book of human fate, as it flutters in the\r\nstorm-winds ever sweeping across the earth; but we have no other light\r\nto guide us across the track which all must tread, save the long\r\nglimmering of yesterdays, which grows so swiftly fainter and fainter,\r\nas the present fades off into the past.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[16] It is said by Pliny to have been discovered first in Ethiopia,\r\nby a man named Obsidius. Hence the name. Gems and whole statues were\r\nmade of it. He also speaks of four elephants of obsidian dedicated by\r\nAugustus in the Temple of Concord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. AMONG THE ARCHIVES.--THINGS NEW AND OLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth of El Palacio, is a waste spot of earth, covering perhaps half\r\nan acre. It contains neither grass, weeds, nor moss, not even a\r\nstraggling sage-bush or forlorn cactus; nothing but bare desert sand\r\nand a solitary cotton-wood tree, whose luxuriant leafage gives no sign\r\nof its struggle for life in a region waterless ten months of the year.\r\nHigh adobe walls bound the sterile enclosure on two sides; the third\r\nis occupied by government buildings; and the fourth is partly wall and\r\npartly abandoned offices, always locked and unused since the brave days\r\nwhen the Spaniards lorded it like princes in “The Palace.”\r\n\r\nEver a lover of lonesome places, I had often wistfully eyed\r\nthese mysterious apartments; and one day, being sadly in want of\r\nentertainment, hunted up the keys and sallied across the back yard,\r\ndetermined to explore the secret places. The first door I tried to\r\nopen was made of heavy double plank, studded with broad-headed nails.\r\nI fitted a key into the rough, old-fashioned lock, and, pushing with\r\nall my strength, it slowly swung on rusty hinges, into a room, perhaps\r\nseventeen by twenty feet in size, barely high enough for a man to stand\r\nupright in. As I stepped on the loose pine boards of the floor, a swarm\r\nof mice scampered to their burrows in the walls, and the deathlike\r\nsmell of mildew and decay smote the afflicted sense. Well for the\r\nchronicles is it there are no rats in the territory. Involuntarily\r\nI paused at the entrance, to let the ghosts fly out; and several\r\nminutes passed before my eyes, accustomed to the darkness of this\r\ntreasure-house, could see the shame of its neglect.\r\n\r\nI had entered the historic room of New Mexico! Tumbled into barrels and\r\nboxes, tossed on the floor in moist piles, lay the written records of\r\nevents stretching over a period of more than three hundred years, the\r\narchives of a Province known as Nueva Espagña, large as France. In an\r\natmosphere less dry than this they would have rotted ages ago. Nothing\r\nbut the extreme purity of the air saved them from destruction.\r\n\r\nIt was mid-winter, and melted snow slowly trickled through the\r\nprimitive roofing of mud and gravel. The sun shone brightly, and,\r\nthough days had passed since the last white spot disappeared from the\r\nsurface of the earth, still a hideous ooze filtered through the ashes\r\nand clay overhead, and dripped in inky streams down the pine rafters\r\nand walls. I am told the house was anciently used as a stable. If the\r\nfirst Spanish commandants and governor-generals kept their horses in\r\nthis windowless cave, sorry am I for the gallant steeds they professed\r\nto love next to their knightly honor and the ladies.\r\n\r\nThe names of some of the _Conquistadores_ have faded from history, and\r\nothers live only in tradition. Nearly all the earlier important records\r\nhave been destroyed. They accumulated rapidly in immense masses, and\r\nthe heavy lumber was shifted from place to place by officials, to\r\nmake room for things more valuable. Careless hands and the slow wear\r\nof time were not as effectual in blotting them out as a certain chief\r\nexecutive--a lineal descendant of Genseric, appointed by President of\r\nthe United States--who made his administration memorable by building\r\na bonfire of parchments and papers, filled with priceless material,\r\nnever to be replaced. He also sold a quantity as waste paper. By happy\r\naccident, a portion of this merchandise was afterward recovered, though\r\none might think it as well employed in wrapping tea and sugar as going\r\nto decay in this neglected den. We grow indignant over the spirit which\r\ncould not spare one reader of the picture-writing of the Aztecs or the\r\n_quippus_ of Peru. What shall we say of the man in authority who, in\r\nthe best age of culture and research, abuses a trust like this, who\r\ndeliberately fired whole wagon-loads of manuscripts of the deepest\r\ninterest to the archæologist, the historian, and student.\r\n\r\nHe had not even the excuse of the first Archbishop of Mexico, who burnt\r\na mountain of manuscripts in the market-place, stigmatizing them as\r\nmagic scrolls; and was more guilty than Cardinal Ximines, who in the\r\ntrial by fire alone could exercise the sorcery concealed in the Arabic\r\nmanuscripts of Granada.\r\n\r\nThe delusions of fifteen hundred years are not easily put to flight,\r\nand there might be a drop of charity for the bigotry and intolerance\r\nof the Spaniard; but the destroyer of history in New Mexico has no\r\ndefense. I suppress his name. An archæologist from New England is now\r\nbusy among a heap of the sold documents, piled away in the back room of\r\nan old shop by a citizen of Santa Fé, who forsaw that they might one\r\nday be of interest, possibly of value.\r\n\r\nIt was my pleasant work to help in overhauling the state papers, and\r\nthe quiet hours of careful work were well rewarded. All sorts of papers\r\nwere tossed together in the cavernous hole. I dug out quantities of\r\nprinted matter of recent date, mixed with the old and weather-stained\r\nofficial documents, letters, copies of reports and dispatches,\r\nmarking political changes from 1580, when Santa Fé was founded by\r\nDon Antonio de Espego, to the year 1879. The province at first was\r\nruled by military governors, appointed by the viceroys of Mexico, and\r\ncommunication with them and with Spain was so rare they reigned as\r\ndespots, in haughty pride of place, and bitterly abused their power\r\nto kill, enslave, plunder, and subdue the heathen claimed for an\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\nThe first MS. opened bore the date 1620. It was illuminated with heavy\r\nseals and signed with strange, puzzling _rubricas_; but the signature\r\nwas completely effaced. It was part of a frozen chunk, tied with hempen\r\ncord, and peeled off a block wet through and through. The excellence of\r\nthe parchment-like paper kept it from dissolving into a lump of sticky\r\npulp.\r\n\r\nSome papers were soaked so it was necessary to spread them on boards,\r\nto be dried in the sun, before being deposited in a place of safety.\r\nRich treasure for the mining of the future historian. The eternal west\r\nwind fluttered mockingly among crumpled leaves torn from the book of\r\nhuman fate, and a sudden gust whirled a yellow scrap high up in the\r\nbranches of the cotton-wood tree. With the help of a Mexican boy, I\r\nrescued from ruin what proved a portion of the journal of Otervin,\r\nmilitary commandant of Nueva Espagña, who undertook to reduce the\r\nPueblos to subjection in 1681, and found them too many for him.\r\n\r\nMixed with high heaps of worthless trash were worn and water-stained\r\nfragments, precious as the last leaves of the Sybil. These, pieced\r\ntogether, were smoothed with care and laid by for after reference.\r\nPoor, perishing records of ambitions baffled and hopes unfulfilled;\r\nand, dreaming over the names of men who sought immortality on earth and\r\nnow sleep forgotten, I deeply felt their teaching--the law that any\r\nlasting condition is impossible in the hurrying march we call life,\r\nwhere nothing is constant but change, nothing certain but death.\r\n\r\nThrough the lazy Mexican afternoons I groped along the musty annals\r\nwith steady purpose, and in the shadowy history wandered back two\r\ncenturies. Among the MSS, I lived in the days when William of Orange\r\nfought the grand battle which decided the fate of the Stuarts and\r\nestablished English dominion over the seas; when the sun of Poland was\r\nsinking in endless night with the dying Sobieski, our patriot hero of\r\nearly romance, whose name, consecrated by poetry and heroism, dwells\r\nin memory with Emmet and Kossuth; when Madame de Maintenon, at the\r\ncourt of the king, who was worshipped as a demigod, was writing long\r\nletters of the fatigues of court, and how she worried from morning till\r\nmidnight, trying to reconcile the irreconcilable, and amuse the old\r\ntyrant, who was past being amused. Spain had been shaken by desperate\r\nwars, and out of armies nursed in victories came a host of adventurers\r\nto the New World, where glory and fortune were reported as waiting for\r\nevery newcomer. They were not colonists, emigrants, as with us, who\r\nhad everything to gain and nothing to lose; but men of the sword, used\r\nto command, who loved no music so well as trumpet and drum, the rattle\r\nand clang of arms. Reckless gamblers as Spaniards have been in all ages\r\neverywhere, they were ready to stake vast possessions on a venture\r\nin mines reported richer than ancient Ophir, and to risk assured\r\nfame for possible conquest, among nations whose walled cities were\r\ndescribed as equal to the best strongholds of Islam. The rich mediæval\r\nglow enveloping some of the reports charms the literary forager, not\r\noverfond of statistics, who loves no figures so well as figures of\r\nspeech. Men in their summer prime organized roving expeditions in quest\r\nof fortune, gallant freebooters, made ferocious by greed of gold, who\r\nstarted gayly, as to a regatta, for the unexplored province of Nueva\r\nEspagña.\r\n\r\nThey found the Promised Land one of which the greater part must\r\nforever remain an uninhabitable magnificence. Yet everything reminded\r\nthem of old Spain, especially of the Castiles. The chain of snowy\r\npeaks, accessible only to the untamable Apache, projected against the\r\nspeckless blue the blade of white teeth which suggested the name of\r\nSierra Nevada. The dry, scorched table-lands, league after league,\r\nstretching away under the blazing sun a shadeless desert, were like the\r\n_mesas_ in the dreariest portions of the kingdom of Philip--and the\r\nmud hovels of adobe, with open apertures for windows, were a perpetual\r\nreminder of the homeless habitations of the Castilian peasantry.\r\n\r\nThe few rich valleys (_pasturas_) capable of cultivation by irrigation\r\nwere not unlike the _vegas_ of the East, and little streams of melted\r\nsnow-water, filtered down from the “iced mountain-top,” cold as snow,\r\nclear as glass, still bear the lovely names of the rills sparkling\r\nalong the Alpujarras.\r\n\r\nThe old hidalgos looked for better things than half-naked savages, mud\r\nhuts, and stunted cornfields. Sterile and forbidding as the country\r\nappeared, they believed an inheritance was reserved for them behind\r\nthe gloomy mountain walls, beyond the awful cañon, where the black,\r\nrushing river is shut in by sheer precipices fifteen hundred feet high.\r\nSustained by a faculty of self-persuasion equaled by no other people on\r\nthe face of the earth, they pushed on and on through the very heart of\r\nthe wilderness, nearly to the present site of Omaha. This was more than\r\nthree hundred years ago; yet are the novel-writers complaining that we\r\nhave no antiquity, no mystery, no dim lights and deep shadows, where\r\nthe imagination of the story-teller may flower and bear fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. AMONG THE ARCHIVES.--A LOVE LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day, while mousing or, as President Lincoln used to say, browsing\r\namong the manuscripts, and musing about the dead and gone heroes, and\r\nhow times have altered since they rode out like Paladins of romance to\r\ntempt Fortune in her high places, I came on a letter which differed\r\nfrom the commonplace documents littered about, and was not emblazoned\r\nwith the splash of any great seal. It was very yellow and musty,\r\nstained in one corner by a blue book thrown on it in the time of\r\nPresident Johnson. It required the daintiest handling. Carefully I\r\nunfolded the sheet, almost thick as vellum and in danger of dropping\r\nto tatters, and marked a spot once sealed with wax, flaked off long\r\nago. The address was Antonio Eusebio de Cubero, Secretary of Gen. Don\r\nDiego de Vargas, Governor of Nueva Mejico. I opened the quaint missive,\r\nand lo! a love-letter, dated Seville, November, 1692. It began with\r\nstately, sweet salute: “To my own true love and faithful knight, from\r\nhis Rosita de Castile.” Like the Dantean lovers,\r\n\r\n  “I turned no further leaf.”\r\n\r\nNearly two centuries the antique billet had lain entombed in this\r\nearthy sepulchre; now would I bring it to the light again, and,\r\ntenderly folding the sheet, I bore it to the quiet of my own room, for\r\nreading at leisure.\r\n\r\nThis is the way it runs, written in diminutive hand, indistinct at\r\nthe beginning, now almost illegible. With tender words, not always\r\nin correctest spelling, the little Rose of Castile writes to Eusebio\r\nAntonio, that her father and big brother wage war in Algeria. She had\r\njust learned to sing, with her mandolin, a madrigal, which she quotes\r\nat length and will not bear translation. I cannot catch the subtle\r\nessence, the exquisite Spanish-Arab perfume and prison it in harsh\r\nEnglish. I know nothing in our language so nearly approaching the\r\ndainty love-ditty as the song of Burns, which will live till the last\r\nlover dies:\r\n\r\n  “Had we never loved so kindly,\r\n   Had we never loved so blindly,\r\n   Never met and never parted,\r\n   We had ne’er been broken-hearted.”\r\n\r\nShe told how, when the young moon was shining, and the fat, cross\r\nduenna was fast asleep, she had crept from her side and out of reach of\r\nher snoring, to wander along the Guadalquivir where the citron shade\r\nis deepest and the silver lilies shadow singing waters. She was tired\r\nof dances and of flattery, and that odious Manuelita, and, lighted only\r\nby the moon and the glow-worm, the maiden lingered by the fountain till\r\nthe bell in the tower rang two. “There, by the bed of sweet basil--dost\r\nremember Eusebio caro?”\r\n\r\nAnd what for, lady fair? _Ay de mi!_ Is there a reader so dull as not\r\nto know, without telling, ’twas to dream, and to dream, and to dream?\r\n\r\nEasy to picture her in graceful youth and all beautiful. The delicate\r\nMurillo head; the Andalusian eyes glancing this way and that from the\r\narched window Moresque; shyly she flitted out the barred gate among the\r\nmyrtles, stepping so lightly she scarcely startled the dove who stirred\r\nin her nest; the flower-like face draped by the veiling, envious\r\n_rebosa_, held close by the rose-leaf hand; the one bright circlet\r\nshining on the taper finger--can you not see her stealing along through\r\nthe golden orange orchard, the almond’s snow-white glitter? There, with\r\ninfinite love and longing, with lips waiting to be kissed, she listened\r\nto the nightingale’s song to the rose, starting at the silken rustle\r\nof her dress; and as the strokes of the bell shook the giant pillars\r\nof the cathedral, fleeing like a guilty thing back to the snoring, fat\r\naunt. Only she lingered a moment to look up at the indigo sky and the\r\nslim Giralda tower, there by the bed of sweet basil--“dost remember,\r\nEusebio caro?”\r\n\r\nSuch was the soft Rosita de Castile, and she asks the old question:\r\nWhen dost thou dream of me, dearest? It is a sort of treachery to\r\npublish the deep secret, and I beg pardon of the shade of the gentle\r\nlady, if it lingers round the hard clay of which these walls are\r\nmade. O tender love! O fond young heart, that stopped beating nearly\r\ntwo hundred years ago! I fear Don Antonio Eusebio was hardly so true\r\nas thou wast. Knights-errant, tilting through the New World, had\r\nno such quest as the blameless Sir Galahad, though they pushed the\r\n“_pundonor_” to the very verge of nonsense. Cortez set an example which\r\nhis successors were quick to follow. Under the garb of gallantry, they\r\nwedded _paramour_, and with high Castilian pride proclaimed their honor\r\nbright when they were ready to fight dragons and die in steel harness\r\nfull knightly.\r\n\r\nYou remember, reader dear, Millais’s “Huguenot Lovers”? Of course,\r\nyou must, for you have often seen it, and even the poor prints retain\r\nsome hint of the lovely original. In all her long galleries Art has no\r\nfairer creation. It is lovelier even than Ary Scheffer’s “Marguerite,”\r\nthan the fallen “Francesca di Rimini.” The loving arms clinging to\r\nthe handsome youth; the wistful, upturned face, so anxious, pale\r\nand tearful, on the eve of parting, which her fears make sad as St.\r\nBartholomew’s--such charm was in the face of my Rosita de Castile; mine\r\nby right of adoption, though she died more than a century before I was\r\nborn.\r\n\r\nHow he looked we know by the portraits of Velasquez. Tall and stately\r\nwas he, lithe and sinewy as one skilled in arms, manly sports, and fond\r\nof hounds and hunting; a long lean hand, with blazing jewels--one a\r\nprecious fire-opal, the Girasol of Zimapan; olive skin and heavy brows;\r\neyes like sharp stilettos; peaked beard, curled mustachios, trimmed\r\nand perfumed; black dress-coat, silken hose, silver shoe-buckles,\r\nspotless neck-ruff; chains and ribbons of honor; golden cross richly\r\nbroidered on his mantle; jingling spurs, the mark of knighthood--this\r\nwas Don Antonio Eusebio de Cubero, who thought to swell his fortune\r\nand fill the measure of his fame under the royal banner upheld by\r\nGovernor-General Vargas.\r\n\r\nNor must we forget to name the good long rapier, worn yet in old Spain,\r\nwhere the sword forever stays the scepter. Add to this pictorial dress\r\nthe graces which wait on youth--refined courtesy and lofty presence,\r\ncome of the habit of command--and you have the secretary of the hero\r\nwho went, saw, and conquered Santa Fé for the crown of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe beloved Eusebio Antonio kept no copy of his vows and promises;\r\nbut I warrant, when there were none but the angels to hear, they were\r\ngiven--made binding and strong. In fair Seville the young lovers stole\r\nfrom the lights and the dancing, down by the bed of sweet basil to seal\r\ntheir contract with solemn oaths.\r\n\r\n  “Mixed with kisses, sweeter, sweeter\r\n   Than anything on earth.”\r\n\r\nThe dear Eusebio was lured away from Rosita’s bower to that New World\r\nwhich is the old. Across the sea had floated, faint and far, like dying\r\nechoes coming near, stories of a land of wild men and beasts, strange\r\nbirds, and hissing serpents; of mountains of rock inscribed with mystic\r\nhieroglyphs, and terraced pyramids, upholding undying fires--temples\r\nthe incense of whose altars ascended forever into a sky of speckless\r\nsapphire. These were the regions of finest furs, of gold-dust and\r\nivory, of silver, pearls, and precious stones, all to be had for the\r\ngathering. Such tales were as singing sirens, as airy hands beckoning\r\nin the shadowy distances of dim and unknown shores.\r\n\r\nWhat wonder the young men were fired with the idea of enriching\r\nimpoverished estates by the plunder of opulent cities, and old men\r\napproved their resolution to grasp some portion of this wealth, to\r\nmarch with triumphant banners through the length and breadth of the\r\nland, all the while striking stout blows for Holy Cross?\r\n\r\nIn that age of few books, when writing was a clerkly accomplishment,\r\nthere had come down from the fathers many traditions of the hero who\r\nhad wrested the scepter from the hand of Atahualpa on the heights of\r\nthe Andes. The discoverer of the Mississippi was a century asleep under\r\nits rushing waters. They had heard the name and fame of the peerless\r\nEnglishman--seaman, soldier, courtier, poet, historian--who sought\r\na city of gold on the banks of the Orinoco. Nor could they believe\r\nthat genius and valor died when the aged paralytic, beggared and\r\nheart-broken, laid his head on the block, saying: “It matters little\r\nhow the head lieth, so that the heart be right,” the noblest head that\r\never rolled in English dust.\r\n\r\nThe supernatural swayed men’s minds in those days, and myriads of\r\nimaginary foes were to be fought, besides the beasts in their dens and\r\nthe naked, painted savage. No doubt that Antonio Eusebio de Cubero felt\r\nequal to every danger he must face--the perilous voyage, and the many\r\nmiseries which Rosita’s fears magnified out of all bounds.\r\n\r\nThe parting for years so weary shook the heart of the little Rose.\r\nBetter than I can tell, my reader knows it. The lingering clasp of\r\nhands, the yearning gaze, the tears, the vows, the prayers; the slow\r\nship (there was no steamer then), with gay pennons and fluttering\r\nsignals, sailing straight into the sunset, into eternity, away, away\r\nout of the world; a fading sail on the flushed water, a speck on the\r\nhorizon’s edge; he is gone, taking with him her happiness, her smiles,\r\nher passionate young heart.\r\n\r\nBut they would return, those _Caballeros_ on the deck of the\r\n“Columella,” heroes every one, bringing the wealth of Pizarro and the\r\nglory of Cortez. The thought was cheer and comfort to Rosita in the\r\nlong, slow waiting--one of the hardest things to be learned in the\r\nlesson of loving. Men have a thousand objects to live for--the whole\r\nworld is theirs, and in their changeful, many-colored life love is only\r\none slender, shining thread; women have nothing but their hearts. He\r\nwent out to a field of limitless possibilities, filled with the charm\r\nof novelty, variety, adventure; she to her maiden bower, her lute,\r\nher embroidery, to dream over the love-words till his very name would\r\nthrill and send the blood dancing through her veins; to wait through\r\nthe dull sameness of empty days, dropping one by one into weary, silent\r\nnights; to watch the last light against the towers, the last sparkles\r\non the sea, making it a sea of glass mingled with fire, and entreat\r\nthe Mother of Sorrows with piteous prayers for the wanderer in the\r\nvague, far-off country beyond them; to sicken for gracious messages and\r\nletters that do not come, and yet be loyal in the belief they have been\r\nwritten, they are somewhere--this is the sweet patience born of woman,\r\nthe brave, persistent faith, almost a religion.\r\n\r\nIt is the one who sails away who forgets; the one who stays at home who\r\nremembers. He was a false teacher who said Paradise is in the shadow of\r\nthe crossing of cimeters. You and I know, dear reader, and our little\r\nRose of Seville knew, it is in the shadow of the one we love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. AMONG THE ARCHIVES. (_Continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the journal of Capitan-General Don Domingo Jeronso Petriz de\r\nCruzate (what a Spanish ring there is in that name!), who was governor\r\nand military commandant of Nueva Mejico from 1684 to 1689, we can form\r\nsome idea of the state of affairs in the province. But a few detached\r\npages of this important document survive. They appear the clearest\r\nwhere all are confused.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards had been driven from the country as far south as the\r\nTexan line. Cruzate’s little army failed in the reconquest of the\r\nliberty-loving Pueblos, and the service was finally entrusted to\r\nGeneral Vargas, or, as it was anciently written, Bargas, to whom the\r\nfaithful knight and true love was secretary.\r\n\r\nThe chronology of this period is some times in a hopeless tangle;\r\nbut the march of Governor-General Don Diego de Vargas is pretty well\r\nconnected. He lives in history as one of the most bigoted and brutal\r\nof the Conquistadores. As has been written of the Duke of Alva: “His\r\nvices were colossal, and he had no virtues.” From shreds and patches\r\nof mouldy MSS. his march is traced with tolerable clearness, and the\r\nconduct of the foreigners was so nearly alike that their stories are\r\nmuch the same.\r\n\r\nBy and with consent of the royal audience, he left home and pleasures\r\nin the City of Mexico for El Paso del Norte, to organize one hundred\r\nfriendly Indians and less than two hundred mounted men. Among the\r\nlatter was the secretary, Antonio Eusebio de Cubero, who on fiesta\r\ndays wore a light glove on his casque, a love-knot on his spear.\r\n\r\nThe country swarmed with a numerous and enraged enemy, and every\r\nleague of ground was contested. Vargas seemed awake to the perils of\r\nthe situation, and to have a wholesome fear of public opinion besides,\r\nfor on the night before marching he wrote to Count Galvas, Viceroy of\r\nMexico: “I have determined to risk life and all in the attempt, and am\r\nprepared rather to be considered rash to being looked upon as a man\r\nof too much caution, thereby exposing my reputation to remarks.” He\r\nwas successful from the very outset. The reader will remember that the\r\nPueblos lived in community houses, built in a hollow square. A whole\r\ntribe sometimes inhabited one house, and one after another they were\r\nreduced to submission.\r\n\r\nThe invading army found game in abundance; but the blessing of the\r\nearly and the latter rain is not for New Mexico, and the scarcity\r\nof water made great suffering. “In roasting-ear time” the bold\r\nland-robbers feasted in the cornfields; “hares like those of the\r\nCastiles” furnished nourishing food; and in all their journeying\r\nsimple natives gave the fair visitants their choicest stores, for\r\npaltry trinkets of glass, pewter, and tinsel. The blaze of their\r\ncamp-fires attracted large numbers of rattlesnakes--“the serpent with\r\ntiger-colored skin and castanets in its tail;” the mountain cat’s green\r\neyes glared at them from the black rim of the illuminated circle; and\r\nlovely gazelles shyly approached the springs, where they had hitherto\r\ndrank undisturbed, to sniff the tainted air and gaze at the strangers.\r\n\r\nThere survives one description of a large torpid lizard the explorers\r\nencountered, striped with red, white and black bars--a hideous\r\ncreature; and a horned snake, kept in spirits, to be sent the viceroy.\r\nHere, too, we hear first of the wonderful traveling stones, that within\r\nthe distance of a few feet of each other seek a common centre, roll\r\ntogether, and lie close like eggs in a nest. They were in the bottom\r\nof shallow basins in the levels, and their magnetism was a source of\r\nwondering awe to the superstitious soldiery. The reporter, a naturalist\r\nof some sort, whose name is lost, begs a moderate subsidy, that he\r\nmay employ natives to help capture the venomous beasts and assist in\r\nmaking collections. The barbarians refused to work, even with wages,\r\nand thus writes Vargas: “I have been obliged to raze whole villages to\r\nthe ground, in order to punish their obstinacy.” Possibly here we have\r\nthe secret of the uninscribed ruins now slowly crumbling down in the\r\nvalleys by the narrowing waters of the Pecos and the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nThe chief burden is the Indian. The chronicles are heavily laden with\r\ndetails of grievances the conquerors were obliged to bear from him. How\r\nhe refused to accept slavery as his best estate; and, worse than that,\r\nhow he rebelled against the power which would force him to worship the\r\nunknown, unseen God, whose sign was the red cross, whose ambassadors’\r\nmarch was tracked by the smoke of cities sacked and burnt, lands made\r\ndesolate, the widow’s cry, the orphan’s wail.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards were disciples of the school of Narvaez, who on his\r\ndeath-bed, being urged by his confessor to forgive his enemies: said\r\n“Bless your heart, Father, I have none. I have killed them all.” In\r\nthose good old times--for as the poet sings,\r\n\r\n  “All times when old are good”--\r\n\r\nthe religion of the governor must be the religion of the governed.\r\nThe Pueblos were and still are sun worshipers; and every day their\r\ndeity--the peculiar friend of the red race--rose with unveiled face,\r\nrejoicing the eyes and cheering the hearts of his children. Why should\r\nthey believe in One whose followers taught that sulphurous flames\r\nwere in waiting for all who had not money enough to pay for certain\r\nmystic rites held over the dead body? Whenever there was chance of\r\nescape, the Indians fled before the mailed and mounted warriors fast as\r\ntheir own mountain antelopes, and the Pueblos were rapidly brought to\r\nsubmission. To perfect the surrender of soul and body, after a city was\r\ntaken, Father Francisco Corvera baptized by thousands at a time. He was\r\nattended by several Franciscan priests, charged with the reconversion\r\nof those fallen from the true faith. They were forced to assemble\r\nbefore a large cross in the plaza. There the red sinners were absolved\r\nfrom their sins, and, on pain of death, forbidden their idolatrous\r\ndances, especially the _cachina_, the delight of the aboriginal heart,\r\nand, as the old MS. words it, “were to be obedient to the divine and\r\nhuman majesty.”\r\n\r\nVery devout was this Vargas. After the reduction of Jemez, he reported\r\nto the Viceroy of Mexico, Count Galvas: “This action having been fought\r\nthe day before Santiago Day, I believe that glorious apostle and patron\r\nsaint interceded in our behalf, and which was the cause of our signal\r\nsuccess.”\r\n\r\nHere are some of the mild requirements laid on the baptized heathen by\r\nhis order:\r\n\r\n“They must keep crosses over their doors; treat ministers with love\r\nand reverence; and, whenever they meet them, kiss the hem of their\r\nhabit, with submission and veneration. They must have their bows in\r\norder and ten arrows, to offend and defend; and none shall dare use the\r\narms of the Spaniards, for the reason they are prohibited by the royal\r\nordinances.”\r\n\r\nFighting his way northward, near Zuni, he leveled a large pueblo, “the\r\nsize of a long horse-race;” but how long the horse-race was in that\r\ntime your correspondent has no means of knowing. By his own autograph\r\non the everlasting hills we know when and in what spirit the haughty\r\nhidalgo passed that point for the recapture of La Villa Real de Santa\r\nFé, then in the hands of its rightful owners.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and ninety miles southwest of Santa Fé, ten miles from\r\nthe Arizona line, fifty miles west of the dividing ridge of the\r\ncontinent--called, in consequence, Sierra Madre--is antique Zuni, a\r\ncity of memory. It is one of the seven vanishing cities sought by\r\nCoronado in 1540, and by wandering knights from Spain and Portugal in\r\nthe time of Philip Second. Capital of the fabled kingdom of Cibola, it\r\nis the most ancient and most interesting, because the least changed, of\r\nall the pueblos of New Mexico.\r\n\r\nWhen Governor-General Vargas and his gallant little army reached this\r\npueblo, they halted for rest and recruiting, before pressing on to the\r\nCity of Holy Faith. The General was accompanied by his secretary, the\r\nbeloved Antonio Eusebio, and they must have looked with the deepest\r\nconcern at the stout walls of the strange fortress. I have not been\r\nable to learn whether he attacked it or not. Even a successful and\r\nintrepid leader, with the help of the red allies, used to savage\r\nwarfare, would deliberate well before besieging that city set on a\r\nhill, which must be carried by assault, in the face of arrows, slings,\r\nlances, huge stones rolled from above, and burning balls of cotton\r\ndipped in oil. The modern Zuni, a compact town of fifteen hundred\r\nsouls, stands in the centre of the valley of the Colorado Chichito\r\n(Little Red River); but ancient Zuni, now in ruins, was several miles\r\naway, on the top of a _mesa_, or precipice, one thousand feet high,\r\nalmost inaccessible from the valley. It was built in five stories, with\r\nthick walls of stone laid in mud mortar, terraced from without and\r\nfortified by towers. A formidable citadel.\r\n\r\nThe camp of the victorious army was probably in the present\r\ncamping-ground, a choice spot, where grass grows with tint of richest\r\ngreen, lovely to the eye as fresh lilies--a garden beauty, skirting\r\nthe spring of cool, sweet water, about fifteen miles from old Zuni.\r\nTo reach it from Santa Fé, the traveler of to-day crosses a country\r\nvery beautiful and fertile, where rapid change of geological structure\r\nmakes varying change of scenery. Maize grows in the valley without\r\nirrigation--not an _acequia_ in sight; and peaches, planted by the\r\nJesuit Fathers, are deliciously sweet. After straining over sand and\r\nrock, in the hot, white sun-glare, with the fever-thirst which comes\r\nfrom drinking alkali water, it must have been a deep pleasure for the\r\nsoldiery to leave the trackless plain, and lie in the cool, rich grass,\r\nrestful alike to jaded steed and war-worn rider; to feast their eyes\r\non the delicate enamel of green--the setting of this Diamond of the\r\nDesert; and watch, as we have, the birds of strange note and plumage\r\ncoming and going, with merry twitter, flirt and flutter, to bathe and\r\ndrink in the sparkling fountain.\r\n\r\nEnchanting effects of light and color vary the passing hours.\r\nA rose-blush of exquisite haze greets the rising sun; and the\r\nmirage--most marvelous of Nature’s mysteries--often swims in mid-air\r\nin early morning, when the first warm flush has faded. The perfect\r\nblue, curtaining the valley, is jeweled with opal and turquoise. That\r\nethereal brilliance allows no “middle tones.” The sun sets as on the\r\nNile, and when the flaring disc sinks low suddenly the hidden splendor\r\nis unveiled--“a vision sent from afar, that mortals may feebly learn\r\nhow beautiful is Heaven.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. AMONG THE ARCHIVES. (_Continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Zuni dispatches were sent back to Count Galvas by a line of swift\r\nrunners reaching to Mexico. Perhaps a letter to Seville from the\r\nfaithful knight, who now had time for sweet thoughts of love, without\r\nwhich this were the wilderness without the manna. I hope the reader\r\ndoes not forget my young hero; for I love him dearly, and mean to stand\r\nup for him to the last, through evil as well as through good report.\r\nSkillful furbishers did what they could to restore the original luster\r\nto dulled and dinted armor, and in the idlesse of camp the secretary\r\nmust often have looked up at two enormous pillars of sandstone towering\r\nhigh on the sides of the _mesa_, appearing chiseled into human figures\r\nof colossal size, fixed, immortal as the statues of Aboo Simbel. At\r\nevening, while my Rosita walked through the drowsy Spanish city,\r\n\r\n  “Guarded by the old duenna,\r\n   Fierce and sharp as a hyena,\r\n   With her goggles and her fan\r\n   Waving on each wicked man,”\r\n\r\nand Antonia Eusebio was smoothing his draggled plumes, he probably\r\nheard from friendly Indians the wild legend still told there by the red\r\nlight of the camp-fires. The tradition runs that Zuni is the only city\r\non the earth which bore the weight of the Flood. Ages ago, an eternity\r\nbefore white men came, rain fell in streams from the sky; adobe houses\r\nmelted away, and the whole world and everything in it was fast sinking\r\nfrom sight. The neighboring tribes escaped from the rushing waters\r\nto the top of this _mesa_; but the waves rose so fast nearly all\r\nperished before reaching the summit of the cliff. In the midst of their\r\ndistress a black night (_noche triste_) fell on the land. Their God had\r\nforgotten them, the sun turned his face away from his children, and\r\n“darkness was the universe.” Still the waters rose higher and higher,\r\nincessant, undiminished; still the people in blind panic pressed to the\r\ntopmost foothold, threatened with the fast-rising overflow. Above the\r\nblack abyss no light of sun or star, sign of promise, dove or olive.\r\nIn desperate extremity, they sought to avert the curse by sacrifice.\r\nNo time was there for song or prayer, altar-fire or incantation. They\r\nsnatched the children of the _cacique_ (a daughter lovely as light, a\r\nsmile of the Great Spirit, and a son beautiful as morning), adorned\r\nthem with a few gay feathers, and hurled them from the steep into\r\nthe boiling abyss--an offering to an offended Deity. The waters were\r\nsurging within a few feet of the top of the _mesa_. There the proud\r\nwaves were stayed. The victims were changed to the stone columns, a\r\nsign from Heaven marking the mountain of refuge where the propitiatory\r\noffering was accepted, and everlastingly commemorating the Deluge.\r\n\r\nThe _mesa_ is a mile across; an irregular figure, defined by abrupt\r\nbluffs, almost perpendicular. On it are the remains of two pueblos,\r\nwhose outlines are clearly traceable--the dimensions of rooms and inner\r\nwalls. Like all ancient towns, they were fortified with an outer wall\r\nin the shape of the letter V, to resist invasions of warlike tribes,\r\nand watch-towers were placed at regular intervals. Crumbling walls,\r\nmade of little blocks of stone laid in mud-mortar, are scattered over\r\nthe ground in heaps from two to ten feet high. Here the fox and coyote\r\nprowl by night, and the antiquarian haunts it by day. After careful\r\ninvestigation, with Indian guides, they report the standing walls\r\nrest on ruins of still greater age. The primitive masonry must have\r\nbeen about six feet thick. In the more recent buildings the walls are\r\nnot over eighteen inches thick. The small sandstone blocks are laid\r\nwith neatness and regularity. Broken pottery is strewn about, and\r\narrow-heads of obsidian, flint, and jasper.\r\n\r\nAfter the Deluge, when the waters abated off the face of the earth,\r\nthe tribes abandoned the hill city, and lived in the pleasant valley\r\ntill the Spanish invasion, when they again fled to the top of the\r\n_mesa_. They turned at every place possible and fortified strongly\r\nthe two approaches by which the outworks could be assaulted, and held\r\nout against the foe a long time. At last the heights were scaled. The\r\nmail-clad warriors, with their swords of matchless temper, triumphed\r\nover the rude arms of the feeble natives. From the highest watch-tower\r\nthe banner of the Cross was unfurled against the brilliant sky,\r\nunflecked by cloud or shadow; and sun-lighted spears glittered in the\r\nnarrow streets of the devoted, the Holy City.\r\n\r\nImprinted in the solid rock, as in clay, is shown and may be seen this\r\nday the foot-print of the first white man who reached the summit. When\r\nyou visit Zuni, the old guide, if you happen to get the right one, will\r\nrepeat this story, for a slight consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Zunis are the Yankees of the Pueblos--self-supporting, keen at a\r\nbargain, thrifty, orderly, clean; that is, clean _for Indians_. I\r\npresume every head in the Holy City could furnish numberless offerings\r\nsuch as Diogenes (oldest of tramps) cracked on the pure altar of the\r\nchaste Diana.\r\n\r\nWhat Cholula was to the Aztec, Zuni is to the Pueblos; sacred as the\r\nCity of David to the sons of Israel. Touching the religion of this\r\npeople opens a subject so broad and so charming I am tempted to give\r\nit more than a passing glance, but space forbids. They are pantheists\r\nin the fullest sense of the word, and, though missions have been\r\nestablished among them three hundred years, they, like all aborigines,\r\nset their face as a flint against change, and still keep to the ancient\r\nbeliefs and customs. They worship the Supreme One, whose name it is\r\ndeath to utter; Montezuma, his brother and equal; and the Sun to whom\r\nthey pray and smoke, because his eye is always open and his ear attends\r\nthe prayers of the red men. The Moon is the Sun’s wife, and eclipses\r\nare family quarrels, that will result in disaster to the world if they\r\nare not soon reconciled. The stars are their children; the largest is\r\nthe oldest.\r\n\r\nBesides these superior deities, there is the great snake, to which they\r\nlook for life, by command of Montezuma.\r\n\r\nLike our sea-serpent on the Atlantic Coast, he glideth at his own sweet\r\nwill, is seen at unexpected places, as suits his pleasure, is longer\r\nthan the tallest pine, and “thick as many men put together.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Zuñi Basketry, and Toy Cradles.]\r\n\r\nIt has been well said the barbarian is the most religious of mortals.\r\nHis dependence on the elements for food and comfort makes the primitive\r\nman regard Nature with eager interest. Powerless against her forces,\r\nif there be something mysterious, threatening, the untutored soul\r\nsupplicates it in prayer, with the inborn faith down deep in every\r\nbreast that behind the visible lies close the Invisible, the Creator,\r\nwho rules the world he made.\r\n\r\nThey adore the rainbow, bright headband of the sky, rivers,\r\nmountains, stones, trees, bears, and other animals. Their fables\r\nappear meaningless to us; but we must not despise them, for many of\r\nour beliefs are equally so to them. The aboriginal brain can never\r\ncomprehend why white men worship a sheet of bunting--white, red,\r\nspangled blue, with the eagle totem--suffer for it, fight for it in\r\narmies numberless as the sands of the desert, and die for it without\r\nmurmur.\r\n\r\nThe myths of the furthest West are wonderfully like the myths of the\r\nfurthest East. Studying them, one cannot fail in the conviction that\r\nhumanity, in all the ages and races, is the same, formed on one model,\r\nunfolding under the influence of the same inspiration; that, left to\r\ntheir own will, men do like things under like conditions, and that\r\ncertain religious ideas are born in every heart, sage or savage, making\r\nworship a human necessity. Here, as in ancient Thessaly, the powers of\r\nHeaven have haunts in the echoing mountain-sides, by pebbly springs, in\r\nthe gloomy shades of the whispering pines, and under the rushing river\r\nand cataract.\r\n\r\nIn New Mexico, where the food supply depends so largely on the winds\r\nand the uncertain rainfall, the savage is most anxious to conciliate\r\nthe gods who preside over these forces. There are altars for their\r\nworship, mystic stones among the gnarled cedars of the Zuni _mesa_,\r\nand a spring of sweet water, sacred to the rain god, rimmed with\r\npebbles precious as the oracular jewels on the breast of the Jewish\r\nhigh priest. No animal is allowed to drink of the holy waters, and they\r\nare purified every year, with vessels dedicated to the service--most\r\nancient jars, handed down through the generations since the evening and\r\nthe morning were the first day. No Zuni drinks from the consecrated\r\n_ollas_, for the spirit of the spring is always watching, and will\r\navenge the indignity with instant death. Once a year, in August, the\r\n_cacique_, with his chief counselors, visits the spring, and washes its\r\nwalls, with the elaborately-tinted vases, which were hallowed by the\r\nfirst high priest. The jars are ranged in order on the rim of the well.\r\nThe frog, the rattlesnake, the tortoise are painted on them, animals\r\nsacred to the presiding deity. Woe to the offender who shall profane\r\nthem by a touch! A fate awaits him like that of Uzza, when he put\r\nforth his hand to hold the ark in the threshing-floor of Chidon. The\r\nlightning of the dread god of storms will strike the sinner dead.\r\n\r\nSomewhere near is a mysterious divine bird, kept in a secret shrine. As\r\nHerodotus says of the Phœnix: “I have never seen it myself, except in a\r\npicture.”\r\n\r\nLike the old Greek, the Pueblo looks up and sees the dead among the\r\nstars. When the Aurora flashes a strange, flickering light along\r\nthe northern sky, it is the mustering of the spirits of the mighty\r\nwarriors, whirling their spears and marching with proud steps, as\r\nthe shade of Agamemnon strode across the fields of Asphodel. The\r\nearthquake’s rumble is the groaning and turning in sleep of a big old\r\ngiant, with voice of thunder, eyes of fire, and breath of flame. He was\r\nso immense that he sprawled across the whole plain, and so powerful the\r\nimmortal gods, finding they could not kill him, tore up a high mountain\r\nand laid it on him, to keep him quiet. What is this but Enceladus?\r\n\r\n  “Under Mount Etna he lies.\r\n    It is slumber, it is not death;\r\n  For he struggles at times to arise,\r\n    And above him the lurid skies\r\n  Are hot with his fiery breath.\r\n\r\n  “The crags are piled on his breast,\r\n    The earth is heaped on his head;\r\n  But the groans of his wild unrest,\r\n    Though smothered and half-suppressed,\r\n  Are heard, and he is not dead.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Zuñi Water Vases.]\r\n\r\nThe best hope and strongest faith of the Pueblos are in the second\r\ncoming of the great King, who is to raise the dead, judge the world,\r\nand reign in peace and righteousness. Struggling with shadows and weird\r\nimaginings, working out their destiny with many a bitter failure, in\r\nanguish of heart they instinctively reach through the darkness for the\r\nalmighty hand of the unseen helper. The sons of Montezuma, as they\r\nlove to call themselves, believe the fullness of time is come, and the\r\nreturn of their Messiah at hand. He will leave his bright sun-house, to\r\nright the wrongs and heal the woes of the race so mercilessly stricken\r\ndown by the Spaniards. Then there will be no more death, neither\r\nsorrow, nor crying; neither shall there be any more pain. Their ideas\r\nare vague and dim. Legends treacherous as memory, and growing fainter\r\nfrom generation to generation, for their wise men are without open\r\nvision, and their sagamores have neither written prophecy nor guiding\r\nstars.\r\n\r\nThe view from the top of the _mesa_ is unspeakably beautiful. Twined\r\namong multitudes of peaks, like tangled ribbons, are streakings\r\nof azure and purple, beneath which, as we know by experience, are\r\noutspread valleys, broad, treeless, scorched with a tropic heat, which\r\nat noonday seems like quivering flame. The pre-historic ruins cover\r\nabout thirty acres, and are scattered in confusion on the level plateau\r\nunder the wind-whipped cedars. Here, until within a few years, was kept\r\nthe consecrated fire burning for centuries--the Montezuma fire; but\r\ntime fails to tell it all. Another day we will come again, and hear\r\nthe fanciful traditions, the misty old superstitions which hover about\r\nthe neglected shrines. They are given with an opulence of fancy which\r\nthrows mists before your eyes. In the hush of solitude, the effect of\r\nthe place is mysterious, and reflection drops easily into belief. Few\r\nworshipers now sacrifice in the primeval temples, where of old they\r\nmust have flocked by hundreds, cherishing the promise of the second\r\ncoming of Montezuma from the pleasant land where the sun rises. The\r\nchiefs crouch with faces toward the east as the morning star goes\r\nsoftly out, and the gray dawn melts into the light of day, yearning as\r\nhuman hearts have yearned in all ages, seeking a sign from Heaven. The\r\nlegend runs that he who shall first behold the King in his beauty shall\r\nreceive some great favor at his hand. Sometimes they wait in silence;\r\nagain they chant a hymn to their god, watching till he shakes his\r\n“plumes of fire” above the mountain-tops and shoots his radiant spears\r\nacross the roseate sky. But the oracles are dumb. Well are they keeping\r\nthe mighty secret!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. AMONG THE ARCHIVES. (_Continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\nA few miles from Zuni, as we move eastward, there gradually comes to\r\nview a bold, high, sandstone rock, a quadrangular wall, white, veined\r\nwith yellow, named Inscription Rock. It is nearly a mile in length and\r\nmore than two hundred feet in height. Approaching it, tower and turret,\r\narchitrave and pillar rise slowly into view. We see a mighty structure\r\nNature has wrought in noble architecture, and that no extravagant\r\ncoloring gave it the old Spanish name _El Moro_--The Castle. The\r\nsurface of the mountain-wall on the north and south faces is written\r\nover with names otherwise lost to history, records that light the dark\r\nway like shining torches. Some are deeply and beautifully cut into the\r\nplane surface and reach back more than three hundred years. The older\r\ninscriptions are Spanish, carefully graven upon the vertical faces,\r\nabout the height of a man’s head from the ground. Usually a date, a\r\nbrief memorandum of the purpose and line of march of the Castilian\r\nsoldiery, the names of travellers exploring the country, or Franciscan\r\nfriars going into the wilderness in search of the lost tribes of Israel.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the towering steep is a gushing spring of sparkling\r\nwater, and fresh grass, such as is not often seen except in narrow\r\nvalleys among the arid plains of the territories. After rest, food,\r\nsiesta, the traveler, looking up to the immense table of stone before\r\nhim, naturally adds his own name to the constantly-increasing list\r\non the written mountain, which has now grown into a confused mass of\r\nhieroglyphs--Indian signs, the favorite being the track of a moccasin,\r\nindicative of marching; decayed and decaying inscriptions, and names\r\nof old adventurers. Let us loiter awhile and read, for it is not often\r\nsuch a register is laid open to any tourist.\r\n\r\nClose to the left corner, almost hidden by brushwood, is the oldest\r\ndate, engraved in the rock nearly a century before the landing of the\r\nPilgrim Fathers--Don José de Basconzales, 1526. This is the sole record\r\nof his expedition, at once his history and his cenotaph. He went with\r\nan exploring party from the City of Mexico, and never returned; nor\r\nwere they heard of after leaving Zuni. Whether they perished in secret\r\ndefiles, cut off by the skulking Apache, who dogged every step of the\r\ninvader, or gave out through fatigue and thirst in the deep cañons and\r\nsterile _vegas_, belongs to the voiceless past. In some unnamed spot\r\nhe sleeps with the silent majority--a mighty company.\r\n\r\nIn the moist air of England these letters would be mossed over and\r\nwholly illegible; but the dry, dewless air of New Mexico holds decay\r\nin check, and in this regard almost equals the atmosphere of Egypt.\r\nAmong recent inscriptions appear the autographs of the United States\r\nexplorers--Whipple, Simpson, and others; and still nearer our day the\r\nsigns manual of the Smiths, Joneses, Browns, and the rest. The sixth\r\nname on the list is the one whose fortunes we are trying to trace out\r\nand follow, less for the sake of his king and country than because he\r\nwas attended by the true love and faithful knight of the little Rose of\r\nCastile.\r\n\r\nIt runs: Here passed Don Diego de Bargas, to conquer Santa Fé for the\r\nroyal crown, New Mexico, at his own cost, in the year 1692.\r\n\r\nMany secrets we cannot guess are hidden in the silence there, with the\r\nsands of ages drifted above them; but it is plain to see Vargas was\r\nin high feather when he made his proud record on the wall of El Moro.\r\nObserve the pert little crow, “at his own cost.”\r\n\r\nLuckily, there is still extant a number of documents bearing on his\r\nadministration among the state papers at Santa Fé, or we might think\r\nthe princely fellow, going out conquering and to conquer, scattered\r\ncommissions and victories with a free hand.\r\n\r\nHow La Villa Real de Santa Fé was lost and won is an old tale and\r\noften told, and details of battles, at least of Indian fighting, are\r\nnot interesting. Enough that, after the summer camp at or near Old\r\nZuni, Vargas with his army pressed on to the siege of the Capital. The\r\nslayers were a few hundreds of white men, with red allies; the slain\r\nwere of a number that has never been reckoned.\r\n\r\nFather Francisco Corvera administered absolution to the entire command\r\nbefore battle, and, as the foreign army was preparing for a general\r\nonslaught, the Pueblos stole out in the night, leaving the city in\r\npossession of the fair race which left nothing but desolation in its\r\ntrack.\r\n\r\nThe brutal instincts of this Vargas (whom I hate, and the judicious\r\nreader must hate too) hardened and intensified with increasing power\r\nand advancing years. One of the worst of his bad race, he labored\r\nunceasingly for the conversion of the aborigines. His position allowed\r\nimmeasurable sweep for cruelty which we may be sure he enjoyed to the\r\nutmost, and the cross became the object of bitter hatred to the heathen\r\nhe claimed for an inheritance. He it was who wrote to the viceroy of\r\nMexico, applying for more troops to carry on the crusade: “You might\r\nas well try to convert Jews without the Inquisition as Indians without\r\nsoldiers.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his religious zeal and boast recorded on Inscription\r\nRock at Zuni, Vargas missed the high place at which he aimed, not,\r\nlike Columbus and Cortez, because he deserved too greatly, but because\r\nthe regiment in garrison and the corporation of Santa Fé, in 1695,\r\npresented charges to the viceroy, Count Galvas, against him for\r\npeculation. He was accused of using public money for private purposes;\r\nof drawing on the public treasury for purchase of corn, mules, etc.\r\nfor settlers, and of selling them and pocketing the proceeds. “Also of\r\nhaving drawn drafts and received moneys for expenses never incurred.”\r\n\r\nHe was removed from office 1697, and with him, doubtless, the faithful\r\nknight and true love, Don Antonio Eusebio de Cubero, who we will\r\nbelieve had the soul of a true knight, and no part or lot in these\r\nignoble transactions.\r\n\r\nWhatever he was, Rosita saw him with eyes anointed; from the beginning\r\na hero predestined to triumph on every field he might enter. I do\r\nbelieve that, in the rough campaigning through the land of sand and\r\nthorn, he kept her lovely face--the Millais face--in his heart of\r\nhearts. That he never vowed a vow nor kissed a kiss that was not hers,\r\nand, loyal to his own Rose of Castile, as he was to his king, he\r\nmarched in the triumph through the streets of Seville. There minstrels\r\nand troubadours hymned high praises (_romances_ they were called), and\r\nbright lady-loves waved silken scarfs to the _conquistadores_, home\r\nfrom the far New World. They were men in the bloom of youth, the very\r\nflower of the Peninsula, and Antonio Eusebio de Cubero was proudest and\r\nnoblest where all were proud and many noble.\r\n\r\nFrom the arched window, set in quaint fretwork and arabesques, Rosita\r\nlooked out and the banner over her was love. Perhaps the Millais\r\nface--that eager, anxious, haunting face--flushed a little at sight of\r\nthe grand parade in the pomp and circumstance the old Spaniard loved so\r\nwell. The soft, dark eyes were not bewildered by the rich confusion of\r\ncolor, the far-floating flags, the dazzle of steel and of silver. Swift\r\nglances singled out one beneath the wavy folds of the royal standard,\r\nbrave as he was beautiful, whose prancing steed, flashing arms, crest,\r\nand plume were familiar, whose sash her own soft hands embroidered.\r\n\r\nLet us picture reunion after years of separation, joy after anguish,\r\nthe rapture of rescue from peril, and so leave them, walking with happy\r\nfeet by the bed of sweet basil, as the first lovers walked in the cool\r\nof the day under the palms of Paradise.\r\n\r\nWhile I write, the letter of the dear, dead woman lies on the table\r\nbefore me; the fading sign from a rose-leaf hand that has been part\r\nof the dust of old Spain so many and many a year. Frail thing, most\r\nperishable, outlasting kings, thrones, the wrecks of states, the decay\r\nof ages! Closing day finds me dreaming over it in the waning light.\r\nI look to the purpling hills. As the sun sinks, they change to fairy\r\ntents, under a line of exquisite color, pink, orange, pale sea green,\r\nthe changeful fringe on the banner of night, ending far up the zenith\r\nin a field of spotless azure. In the farness of the distance the cold,\r\nwhite peaks of the Stony mountains warm for one supreme moment in the\r\nsolemn beauty of the after-glow, their summits clear-cut against the\r\nrainless blue.\r\n\r\nRapidly the shadows deepen. Violet changes to leaden hues, rose dims to\r\npearl gray, the flushed white foreheads pale, the fires of sunset burn\r\nout, and the short twilight, ending in gloom, is the day’s burial.\r\n\r\nHuman phantoms flit across the dusky spaces. King and priest, savage\r\nand Christian, knight and lady, shadows all, passing within the mighty\r\nshadow. Under the low window I hear the tramp of feet pacing to and fro\r\nlike the ebb and flow of the tide. The hurrying feet are ghost-like,\r\ntoo, chasing the flying specters’ gold and fame. History is but\r\nrepeating itself. The restless, dissatisfied souls of the New World\r\nare the same brotherhood as those of the Castiles; the same as when\r\nSolomon sent ships from Tarshish to bring back gold of Ophir; the same\r\njealous souls as when the king was wroth because the people shouted,\r\nSaul has slain his thousands and David his ten thousands. Now, as then,\r\nmorning and evening bring their old beauty, the cooling balm of the\r\nbreeze follows the burning day. The west wind cools no fever of heart\r\nor brain; still are men searching for signs of gold and fighting the\r\nold battle against oblivion, and still do loving women sit by solitary\r\nfires and wait for them to come. These things have not changed; they\r\nwill never change. Humanity remains the same.\r\n\r\nThe foreign charm which was the dower of the historic city is dying\r\nfast, but not quite dead. The spell, long lingering, is slow to pass\r\naway, though student and antiquary are blowing the dust from the books\r\nof Chronicles and letting the white light of day into obscured and\r\ndarkened chambers.\r\n\r\nIn this dimness once glowed the poetic coloring of romance and\r\nchivalry, in which the valorous Espego and his knights founded the City\r\nof Holy Faith. If the ghosts of the venturesome heroes revisit the\r\nfield of their victories, they may yet be reminded of soft Andalusia.\r\nThere is a hint of Castilian grace in the vanishing _sombrero_, in\r\nthe folds of the ever-falling but never-fallen _rebosa_, a touch of\r\npassing sweetness in the prolonged _adios_. Blent with the familiar\r\nbenediction, now in my ear, “_Vago usted con Dios que usted lo pase\r\nbien_” (“May you depart with God and continue well”), the hovering\r\nshades might hear the dreamy plash of bright fountains and the light\r\nlove song under the barred windows of fair Cordova.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. THE JORNADA DEL MUERTO.\r\n\r\n\r\nNear the southern boundary of New Mexico the Spanish explorers were\r\nopposed by a barrier of all on earth most to be dreaded--a shadeless,\r\nwaterless plateau, nearly one hundred miles long, from five to thirty\r\nmiles wide, resembling the steppes of Northern Asia. Geologists tell us\r\nthis is the oldest country on the earth, except, perhaps, the backbone\r\nof Central Africa; at least the one which has longest exhibited its\r\npresent conditions, the one longest exposed to the influence of agents\r\nnow in action, and, hence, bearing the most deeply-marked records of\r\ntheir power.\r\n\r\nThe portion I speak of appears to have served its time, worn out, been\r\ndispeopled and forgotten. The grass is low and mossy, with a perishing\r\nlook--the shrubs, soap-weed, and bony cactus writhing like some grisly\r\nskeleton; the very stones are like the scoria of a furnace. You vainly\r\nlook for the flight of a bird, such as cheered the eyes of Thalaba in\r\nthe desert; no bee nor fly hums the empty air; and, save the lizard\r\n(the genius of desolation) and horned frog, there is no breath of\r\nliving thing.\r\n\r\nCertain tribes of Arabia have no name for the sea, and, when they first\r\ncame to its shore, they asked, with a sad wonder: “What is this strange\r\ndesert of water, more beautiful than any land?” Standing on the edge of\r\nthe measureless waste, which is trackless as water, the first explorers\r\nmight ask: “What is this strange ocean of sand, with its stillness more\r\nawful than any sea?”\r\n\r\nIn places the dead level of the plain sweeps with the exactness of a\r\nsheet of water, encircling as with a shore-line mountain-walls which\r\non the west shut off the Rio Grande, and frequently insulating whole\r\npeaks and ridges. Friendly showers fall there two months in the year,\r\nand, instead of storms of rain, in spring it is burned by those of dust\r\nand sand. They are caused by winds coming mainly from the northwest,\r\ncarrying before them, like mist, clouds of pulverized sand and dust,\r\nand piling them in drifts when checked in their course. You can watch\r\ntheir progress as they approach, beginning in a thin haze along\r\nthe horizon, for hours beforehand; and when they reach you the dust\r\npenetrates everything. You eat it, you drink it, you breathe it, you\r\nwear it like a coating, and the last handkerchief at the bottom of the\r\nbox in your trunk is gritty and smells of alkali. The sand-storms, as\r\nthey are called, usually last one, sometimes three days. Occasionally\r\nthey appear a procession of whirlwind columns, such as are seen in\r\nautumn leaves, slowly moving across the desert in spectral dimness.\r\nRejoice and be thankful if the tempest passes without striking. It will\r\nbeat the mules without mercy and lash your face like a whip, if it\r\nreaches you.\r\n\r\nStories are told how, after a day of intense heat and lifeless silence,\r\na dark cloud rapidly lowers from the sky of molten brass, and a sudden\r\nwind whirls the sand in mounds, and so shifts it from place to place.\r\nHorses and mules fall flat, with their noses to the ground; men lie\r\ndown under blankets, from which the sand must be shaken occasionally,\r\nto escape being literally buried alive. Storms of such violence are\r\nrare, but every old frontiersman can tell you of more than one. The\r\nearly Spaniards called the desert hot wind _solana_, in memory of\r\nMancha and Andalusia. It heats the blood terribly, produces the utmost\r\ndiscomfort and nervous irritation. Hence the Castilian proverb: “Ask no\r\nfavor while the solana blows.”\r\n\r\nA variation of the simoom of the Orient, it cracks the skin, creates\r\nconsuming thirst, and has been known to produce death.\r\n\r\nThe reader need hardly be reminded that the destruction of\r\nSennacherib’s host is supposed to have been caused by the simoom.\r\nUndoubtedly, Byron had it in mind when he wrote the Hebrew melody,\r\nwhich has the majestic thunder-roll of organ music,\r\n\r\n  “The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold.”\r\n\r\nOnce feel the parching, torrid heat; once face that suffocating\r\ndesert-wind, and you readily comprehend death was instantaneous. There\r\nwas no waste of miraculous force in the power which destroyed all the\r\nmighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains, in the camp of the\r\nking of Assyria\r\n\r\n  “For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast,\r\n   And _breathed_ in the face of the foe as he passed;\r\n   And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,\r\n   And their hearts but once heaved and forever grew still.”\r\n\r\nThe spot I am trying to describe is the battle-ground of the elements.\r\nIn winter it is made fearful by raging storms of wind and snow. There\r\nmen and animals have been frozen to death, their bodies left the lawful\r\nprey of the mountain wolf. From the primeval years the Apache has\r\nharried the hungry waste, hunting for scalps; and, besides the savagest\r\nof savages, it is now the favorite skulking-place of outlaws, an asylum\r\nfor fugitives escaping justice in old Mexico and Texas.\r\n\r\nIn our times many a party cut off and many a traveler murdered makes\r\ngood the name it bears, given by the first white men who dared its\r\nperils: _Jornada del Muerto_--“Journey of Death.”\r\n\r\nReports of sun-scorch and lava beds, sand, sirocco, maddening thirst,\r\nand cheating mirage did not daunt the bold land-robbers from Spain.\r\nThey were pledged to wrest their secrets from the mountains, and bring\r\nthem to lay at the feet of their imperial master. Disciplined in the\r\nhardships of foreign wars, they lived for glory and worshiped Fortune.\r\nThey had seen service in almost every clime. Some had tilted with the\r\nMoor; some had fought the infidel on the blue Danube, and hunted the\r\nCarib in Hispaniola; and later came captains whose waving plumes had\r\nbeen the colors to rally on when the royal standards were fallen. The\r\nmysterious country, mountain-locked and guarded by savage sentinels,\r\nwho seemed to require neither rest, food, nor sleep, and were so fleet\r\nof foot they could outmarch the best cavalry horses, was a high stake,\r\ninvolving heavy risks and not to be lightly won. From accounts of\r\nJesuit missionaries, who went with the cross, ready to die for their\r\nfaith, the heroes of the seventeenth century learned that Nature in\r\nNueva Espagña was not always in stormy mood. The fiery solana spent\r\nits strength in three days, and the lull following it was like clear\r\nshining after rain. If the snow of winter was deep, it was not lasting\r\n(only a Christmas storm); and friendly natives taught them that the\r\nstony Sierras could be brought to yield gold, silver, copper--all the\r\nprecious metals.\r\n\r\nAlong their sides were sparkling springs, and at their feet green\r\nvalleys, where Summer nestled long and lovingly--_pasturas_ in which\r\nan abiding June encamped and ruled the year. They were tufted with the\r\nshort, delicate buffalo grass, lovely with its strange clusters of\r\npistillate flowers and bunches of rosy stamens, and so strongly and\r\nclosely matted it could well bear the tread of the monstrous Cibola\r\n(buffalo). Over all, like the purple mountain veils, threaded with\r\nfire, hung a delicious mystery.\r\n\r\nThe old-time heroes were deeply superstitious and well versed in\r\nlegendary lore. As they penetrated the _Jornada_, spectral illusions\r\nhaunted them. Demons lurked in the tall soap-weed, and glared over\r\ntheir tops, grimacing threateningly.\r\n\r\nWhen, weakened by long fastings, the sky spun round, goblins, “with\r\nleathery wings like bats,” filled the air, and foul fiends, which\r\ncould be exorcised only by prayer, made every step a terror. Fearless\r\nleaders, who regarded enterprise honorable in proportion to its peril,\r\nand had looked death in the face as if they loved it, quailed before\r\nthe undiscovered country, the pathless _Jornada_.\r\n\r\nIn bivouac at sunset, there was much crossing of forehead and breast,\r\nmurmur of aves and amens; not whispered, but outspoken, as became the\r\n“Swords of the Church.”\r\n\r\nThey set up their swords in the sand, knelt before the blessed sign\r\non their hilts, and fervently prayed the Holy Mother’s protection. So\r\ncomforted, they slept, perchance to dream of cool fountains in far\r\n_plazas_; of glassy ponds, with white-breasted swans asleep among the\r\nreeds and rushes on the margin; of rushing books, shaded by dripping\r\nwillows; and the low undertone of the halcyon sea, whose soft-beating\r\nsurf breaks on the shores of old Spain.\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to read of their superstitious dread of horned frogs,\r\nwhich hopped out of the way, then “turned and faced them with basilisk\r\neyes.” The sameness of the scenes was sickening; the glare of the\r\nfierce sunshine blinded them; and, with cracked lips and burning eyes\r\nthey hailed the mirage with shouts, and, horse and rider seeing eye\r\nto eye, they dashed away for the mocking lake, to curse the cheat and\r\nthirst the more.\r\n\r\nTraversing the desert is not now what it was in the age of fable.\r\nThe delusions of the past vanished with the darkness to which they\r\nbelonged. We are living in better times. Summer, winter, moonbeam\r\nor starbeam will never shine on goblins more. The “leathery wings”\r\nhave floated away from cactus thicket and mezquit jungle; ghost,\r\nfairy, demon, genii all have fled into the listening silence. They\r\nwere phantoms following the century of credulity, whose foremost man,\r\nclear-eyed and conscientious, aimed his inkstand at the Devil, and\r\nwhose veteran campaigner from the siege of Granada went wandering up\r\nand down the everglades of Florida, seeking an enchanted fountain--an\r\never-flowing spring, of which one draught would restore to his war-worn\r\nbody the freshness of youth, and add to his term of life years enough\r\nto discover and conquer a third world.\r\n\r\nThe _Jornada_ still has its alarms; but men of the nineteenth century\r\nsee no angry eyes in the red glow of sunset; overhead hovers no evil\r\nspirit of earth or air, under cover of night’s blue and starry banner.\r\n\r\nThe centre of the ninety-mile desert is now broken by a watering-place,\r\nthe cheering oasis which relieves the long strain on body and soul. In\r\n1871 Major John Martin dug one hundred and sixty feet, and struck a\r\nsweet, abundant fountain, deliciously cool, soft, with a slight taste\r\nof sulphur. Its depth is forty feet, and the heaviest draughts have\r\nnever lessened the supply. It is pumped by a windmill, which the wind\r\nsometimes makes his own; and the gurgle and plash as the stream falls\r\ninto the huge tanks, is a sound in the ear of the traveller sweet as\r\nhis first hearing of the nightingale. Before the well was made water\r\nwas hauled in barrels to the station from the Rio Grande, fifteen miles\r\naway. The nearest fuel at that point is eighteen miles distant.\r\n\r\nAt Fort Craig, the southern terminus of the solitary place, the modern\r\ntourist fills his water-kegs and canteens, tightens his cartridge-belt,\r\nand looks carefully to the condition of his animals. The loss of a\r\nbreast-strap or horse-shoe would be a hindrance not easily overcome,\r\nand supplies of every kind must be carried. The road is excellent, and,\r\nif there is no accident, the well may be reached in one day’s journey.\r\nEven in its best aspect it is entered the first time with forebodings,\r\na vague dread, like pushing out into an unknown sea. The sun-glare\r\nis so hard to bear that night is often the accepted time for the\r\nmournful crossing. As the sun declines, the lonesome dark falls like\r\na drop-curtain. The stars flash out; the sky above, intensely clear,\r\nis a steel-blue shield, set thick with diamonds. A tropic brilliance\r\nfills it with a glow like the mild twilight of other latitudes, and\r\nthe moon’s splendor makes beautiful even the seared and jagged cliffs\r\nof the Sierra de los Organos. Three thousand feet above the level of\r\nthe river are their shafts, pale gray in the silvery light; masses of\r\ngranite up-heaved in some mighty convulsion, long stilled, standing\r\nagainst the rainless blue like tombstones over a buried world.\r\n\r\nIf there is talk in the ambulance, it is in subdued tones. The\r\nassumption of cheerfulness by humming snatches of old songs is a dreary\r\nimpertinence. Hour after hour we travel in silence, unbroken but by\r\nthe grind of wheels plowing through the sandy soil. In answer to your\r\nutmost listening, you may catch the yelp of the red fox, or from the\r\nfar-off mountain the coyote’s shrill cry. Sometimes the driver drops to\r\nsleep, and the wagon stops. Lift the canvas curtain, and look out. The\r\nsoft wind blows in even cadence and swell, but meets only the hushed\r\nnight and its burning lights. The Milky Way is a solid white gleam,\r\nwhere the invisible gods are walking. The missing stars are here. How\r\nlow they swing in their serene and silent spaces. Beneath the solemn\r\ngrandeur of the heavens, the work of Him in whom is no haste, no rest,\r\nno weariness, no failure, we bow in awe. What a little speck is our\r\nwagon-train; what an atom is self, the object round which our weak\r\nthoughts revolve.\r\n\r\nThe mountain-rim is restful to the sight. There are the gushing\r\nsprings, cool as snow; and the shady pines, whose never ceasing song\r\nwe cannot hear. How still it is! No ripple of water, no stir of leaf\r\nor bough, grass or blossom, or any green thing. Ominous crosses by the\r\nwayside mark the graves of travellers, scalped, tortured, and mangled.\r\nThe weight of the tragedy is on us. We feel a near kinship to the\r\nsleepers below, and would not tremble to see them rise and shake their\r\ngory locks at us. The vacant space lies stark and unmoved, as it lay\r\ncenturies ago, when the first gold-hunters, in fear and yet in triumph,\r\nbraved its unknown depths. The prostrate plain, the rigid outlines of\r\nthe naked landscape, the intolerable dumb lifelessness are indeed _del\r\nMuerto_.\r\n\r\nAnd here I pause to describe the weapons used by wild tribes of Indians\r\nwho infest the _Jornada_. On my wall, beside a victorious banner furled\r\nand bruised arms hung up for monuments, are the full equipments of an\r\nApache chief, killed near Fort Stanton, New Mexico. The shield, made of\r\nthick, tanned buffalo hide, is stiff and hard, and resounds under your\r\nknuckles like a drum. In being made it was stretched over a light frame\r\nof basket-work and dried. It is twenty inches across, and as round as\r\nthe shield of the elder Ossian.\r\n\r\nAn outer cover of dressed deer-skin envelops the buffalo hide, drawn\r\nsmooth and gathered round the edge on the under side with a leather\r\nthread. Traced in blue-black ink on it are round figures, which may\r\nrepresent the sun or a spring, and zigzags, which by straining one’s\r\nfancy may be imagined to represent mountains.\r\n\r\nAt the upper rim of the shield are the decorations; three pea-fowl\r\nfeathers, probably amulets, and a medicine-bag of black muslin\r\ncontaining a dry powder which the warrior rubs on his heart before\r\ngoing into battle, “to make it big and brave.”\r\n\r\nA scrap of iridescent shell is fastened to the centre, and there on\r\noccasion, and around the edge, dangle bloody tufts, the reeking scalps\r\nof the enemy. It was carried on the left arm by two straps slipped over\r\nthe hand, and was kept in motion while in action, by which means the\r\nhostile arrows glanced off.\r\n\r\nBut it was not proof against the mightier arms of the white race, and\r\ntwo bullet-holes through the shield show how the red chief came to his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe spear is an ugly weapon six feet long, about as thick as a\r\nbroom-handle, and made of an extremely light wood, to me unknown,\r\npainted red in one band three inches wide near the head. The point is a\r\npiece of iron, probably an old Mexican bayonet, twenty-two inches long,\r\nsocketed into the pole, and further strengthened in its place by a cord\r\nof deer-skin wrapped tightly round it many times.\r\n\r\nBefore Indians knew the use of iron, the spear, or lance, as it is\r\nusually called, was pointed with obsidian, or some other flinty\r\nsubstance, hammered and ground to a sharp edge. Sometimes the heel of\r\nthe shaft is balanced with eagle feathers, while others are caught\r\nalong the shaft, giving steadiness to the flight and gratifying the\r\ntaste of the owner.\r\n\r\nThe quiver is twenty-seven inches long, is made of white cow-skin\r\ntanned with the hair on, sewed with a thread of deer-skin, and is large\r\nenough to contain a sheaf of two dozen arrows. A fringe of the same\r\nmaterial dangles at each end of the quiver and adorns the waist-belt.\r\nWhen it was in use a band of cow-skin, four inches wide, held it across\r\nthe shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe arrows are shafts two feet long, made of a species of yucca,\r\ntipped with hoop-iron and old knife-blades, which are roughly ground on\r\neach side, sharply pointed and edged, probably by rubbing with stone.\r\nThey are winged with three feathers of the wild turkey, stripped from\r\nthe quill and tied round the shaft at equal distances with very fine\r\ntendons, like the E violin string. The iron points are all that betray\r\nintercourse with white men, and were probably stolen from the refuse of\r\nsome camp.\r\n\r\nAn Apache boy, of ten or twelve years of age, will strike a cent\r\nthree times out of five at a distance of fifteen yards. Practice of\r\nbow-shooting begins as soon as these boys are old enough to hold the\r\nweapon, and ends only with death.\r\n\r\nAt fifty yards the well-pointed iron arrow is dangerous and sure, and\r\nthe strong-armed Indian easily drives it through a two-inch plank. He\r\ncan fire it more rapidly than an ordinary revolver, and even though he\r\npossesses “a heap firing-gun,” as he calls a repeating rifle, he is\r\nnever without the silent, unerring and deadly iron-headed arrow.\r\n\r\nIt is far superior to the gun for night-surprises and taking off\r\nsentinels, and on the hunt half-a-dozen animals may be killed before\r\nthe rest of the herd are alarmed. It is to be relied on when ammunition\r\nfails, and so light as to be worn without the least encumbrance.\r\n\r\nThe wary Indian is careful of his arrows, although he has many, wasting\r\nnone in random shots, and keeping his quiver well filled. Sometimes a\r\nthousand arrows are buried in the grave of a chief, a sign that his\r\ndeath will be avenged by his tribe.\r\n\r\nA narrow band of red on the feathered end of the shaft is the only\r\nattempt at ornamentation.\r\n\r\nA fringed leather arm-guard, or bracelet, is worn round the left wrist,\r\nto defend it from the blow of the bow-string. Sometimes it is made of\r\ngray eagle feathers and the vari-colored tips of humming-birds’ wings.\r\n\r\nIn shooting-matches the contest is carried on by men and boys; betting\r\nis high and exciting, and sometimes entire fortunes such as a pair of\r\nmoccasins, a pink calico shirt and blanket, are staked upon the hazard.\r\nThe whole tribe, men, women and children, turn out as spectators. A bad\r\nshot is received with yells of derision, though failures by experts\r\nare rare. If the slender white wand aimed at is not touched, the shaft\r\ngenerally lodges in the circle of loose earth thrown up about the\r\ntarget to catch the arrows and prevent their blunting.\r\n\r\nSaid an old frontiersman to me, “I have never yet seen the Indian bow I\r\ncould not break across my knee.” I doubt if he could crack the one now\r\nbefore me. Many a hand has tried to string it and failed, completely\r\nas the suitors in the classic story. It is of Osage orange forty-two\r\ninches long, bent in the graceful curvature poetry assigns to the bow\r\nof the god of love.\r\n\r\nFormerly to this ornament the wild tribes added a mighty war-club of\r\nmezquit wood, flat and crescent-shaped, with a round ball at the end.\r\n\r\nIn all the Indian weapons there is no sense of grace in outline, except\r\nthe curved bow, no elegance in the winging, no brilliance in the rough\r\nstains of poor color. They simply mean business; the effect of the\r\ngroup now before me is savage in the extreme.\r\n\r\nArm the warrior with them, mount him on a half-wild mustang which he\r\nguides with the knee, and he is a king of men. Place on his neck as\r\na crowning garniture the ornament taken from the body of the fallen\r\nchief, and round his neck put a piece of doubled horsehide, with two\r\nrattle-snakes’ tails, each containing eleven rattles dangling from it.\r\nImagine the brutish face painted in hideous stripes, vermilion and\r\nblue; the buffalo-robe blanket, the wild hair flying, the long lance\r\nwhirling, brandished in air, and add, if you can, the war-whoop, a\r\nyell--\r\n\r\n  --“As if the fiends from heaven that fell\r\n  Had pealed the banner cry of hell.”\r\n\r\nThen you will have a picture of an Apache Indian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. SOMETHING ABOUT THE APACHE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chase is the natural outlet for much savagery; but the wild tribes\r\nof North America are more hardly driven now than ever before, owing to\r\nthe rapid disappearance of game, especially the buffalo. Time was when\r\nthe _cibola_, as they called him, fed, warmed, and clothed the nomads.\r\nIndians are now moved about as far west as they can go, and the buffalo\r\ngoes with them, but is disappearing much more rapidly than the Red Man\r\nis.\r\n\r\nThe narrowing limits of his range make many a chase barren as that of\r\nthe English party in the Catskills, gayly hunting the great American\r\nbison in the Summer of 1876.\r\n\r\nHe once ranged as far east as the Atlantic seaboard in Virginia and\r\nthe Carolinas. From Catesby we learn that, about the year 1712, herds\r\nof buffalo were seen within thirty miles of Charleston, South Carolina.\r\nThe decrease of their main reliance for food and clothing alarmed the\r\ntribes years ago; and in the last generation they brought forward the\r\nfact in their pow-wows with commissioners: “The _cibola_ is dying,\r\nand the red brother must keep peace with the pale face, and eat his\r\nspotted buffalo.” (Indian for domestic cattle.) Such was the peaceful\r\nand alluring speech of the war chief of the Apaches; but the promise\r\nof peace was never kept. To steal and murder, and, under the show of\r\nfriendship beat out the brains of unsuspecting men; to carry off to\r\ncaptivity worse than death the women and larger children, was merely a\r\nquestion of _opportunity_.\r\n\r\nThe “spotted buffalo of the white brother” is hardier than the\r\nancient and lawful game which ranged in such vast herds along the\r\nArkansas, Republican and Platte Rivers, and the future geographers\r\nwill not regale ingenuous American youth with that blood-curdling,\r\nhair-whitening picture of the shaggy and ferocious beasts rushing to\r\nsuicide over an awful precipice overhanging a bottomless abyss. The\r\nbison will rather take his place in natural history with the extinct\r\ndodo and the out-going cassowary.\r\n\r\nThe tanned skin of the buffalo is the best material for the manufacture\r\nof “tepes,” and the “_bois de bache_” is as good fuel as the Indian\r\ndesires. It has been erroneously stated that only the white man kills\r\nand wastes buffalo. They are, or have been frequently killed by war\r\nparties, who take what may be needed as food; but the rest of the\r\ncarcass falls to the portion of wolves and ravens, never far off. Young\r\nbuffaloes fall a prey to the hungry gray wolf and coyotes, and a sick\r\nor wounded buffalo has a long train attendant of wolves, thirsting for\r\nhis blood.\r\n\r\nCoronado, the old Spanish explorer who crossed the Gila in 1540, wrote\r\na curious and accurate description of the _cibola_, of which I copy\r\na portion: “These oxen are the bigness and color of our bulls; but\r\ntheir horns are not so great. They have a great bunch upon their fore\r\nshoulders, and more hair upon their fore part than on their hinder\r\npart; it is like wool. They have, as it were, a horse’s mane upon their\r\nback-bone, and much hair and very long from the knee downward. They\r\nhave great tufts of hair hanging down their foreheads, and it seemeth\r\nthey have beards, because of the great store of hair hanging down at\r\ntheir chins and throats. The males have very long tails, and a great\r\nknob or flock at the end; so that, in some respects, they resemble\r\nthe lion, and, in some, the camel. Their masters have no other riches\r\nor substance; of them they eat, they drink, they apparel, they shoe\r\nthemselves; and of their hides make many things, as houses and ropes;\r\nof their bones they make bodkins; of their sinews and hair, thread;\r\nof their horns, maws and bladders, vessels; and of their calf skins,\r\nbuckets, wherein they draw and keep water.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Navajo Indian with Silver Ornaments.]\r\n\r\nThe whole living of the roving tribes is thus cut off with the buffalo.\r\nThe Apache love of meat is not fastidious, and they are fond of mule\r\nand horse flesh. Deer, antelope--whatever the game may be--every\r\nportion, except the bones, is consumed, the entrails being an especial\r\ndelicacy. They partially cook it, generally eating it extremely rare;\r\nthat is, about half raw. Fertile valleys in the territories bear a\r\nsmall proportion to the extent of arid deserts, lava beds, and plains\r\nof sand. Isolated peaks contain wood and springs, thus affording\r\nprotection for the sure-footed savage, who can outmarch our best\r\ncavalry horses. The scant grass is soon exhausted, so he must move from\r\nplace to place, or starve, and thus necessity is added to inclination;\r\nand they roam over immense tracts of country, seeking what they may\r\ndevour.\r\n\r\nThey have smoke signals by day and fire beacons at night, and systems\r\nof telegraphy understood only by themselves. The displacement and\r\noverturning of a few stones on a trail, or a bent or broken twig, is a\r\nnote of warning like the bugle call to disciplined troops. They cross\r\nthe _Jornada del Muerto_, “journey of death,” as the ninety mile desert\r\nwas called by the Spaniard, with an ease and fleetness no white man\r\ncan imitate, and, swooping down from refuges in the natural fortresses\r\nof the mountains, pounce upon the travelers. The many crosses dotting\r\nthe roadsides of Southern Arizona and New Mexico mark the graves of\r\nmurdered men; indeed, the country seems one vast graveyard, if we\r\nmay judge by the frequency of these rude memorials. Trained by their\r\nmothers to theft and murder from childhood, they are inured to all\r\nextremes of heat and cold, hunger and thirst. They are cunning as\r\nthe red fox and insatiate as tigers, so ingenious in preparing for\r\nsurprises that they will envelop themselves in a gray blanket, sprinkle\r\nit carefully with earth, to resemble a granite bowlder and be passed\r\nwithin a few feet without suspicion. Again, they will cover themselves\r\nwith fresh grass, and, lying motionless, seem a natural portion of the\r\nfield, or hid among the yuccas, they imitate the appearance of the\r\ntree, so as to pass for one of the plants.\r\n\r\nThree-fourths of the Apache country consists of barren volcanic rocks\r\nand sterile ridges, where no plow can be driven and no water found,\r\nand campaigning in their country is exposure to severe privations and\r\ndangers, aside from the attacks of the natives. There is no hope of\r\nglory to cheer the soldier who upholds our flag in that dreary field;\r\nthere is no stimulus but duty. If he succeeds, the feeblest echo\r\nreaches the ears of friends in the states; scant mention is made in\r\nthe papers; there is small honor in killing an Indian, still less in\r\nfalling before one. And the work is endless, fruitless. It is to be\r\nrecommenced every Spring, and as regularly stopped in the Fall by the\r\nsnows of Autumn. A passing interest is roused; but it is brief, because\r\nthe atrocities are so frequent and monotonous; always the same tale\r\nof insult, torture, death; and every year the same inquiry is made at\r\nWashington, and runs along the frontier, What can be done with the\r\nApaches?\r\n\r\nThey should be exterminated, you say.\r\n\r\nYes, dear reader; but, unfortunately for our gallant army,\r\nextermination is a game two can play at.\r\n\r\nVery few know, or care to know, that in the Apache War, ending October,\r\n1880, more than four hundred white persons were scalped and tortured to\r\ndeath with devilish ingenuity. The war began on account of the removal\r\nof about four hundred Indians from their reservation at Ojo Caliente\r\n(warm springs), New Mexico. This is the ideal of a happy hunting\r\nground. Standing on the parade ground at Fort Craig, you look toward\r\nthe Black Range mountains, clad in pine groves, abounding in game and\r\nthe precious stones so rare in New Mexico and Arizona. Morning and\r\nevening wrap them in aerial tints of surpassing loveliness; and one can\r\nwell imagine such a spot would be very dear to any one calling it home,\r\nbe his color what it may. When the news came, the Indians received the\r\nannouncement with deep grief and bitter curses. The reason assigned by\r\nour Government for the removal from this spot to the arid, volcanic\r\n_mesa_ of Arizona was that two agencies might be consolidated, and the\r\nexpense of maintaining them lessened. They went unwillingly, because\r\nthis beautiful country was the land of their fathers, and because\r\nthey could not live peaceably with the Indians of the San Carlos\r\nreservation, and only at the bayonet’s point would they march. Their\r\nwar chief was Victorio, successor to the renowned Magnus Colorado,\r\nwho was the most influential and successful statesman and warrior the\r\nApaches have had for a century. They left Ojo Caliente, with its green\r\nfields and glorious mountains, in the Spring of 1877. In September,\r\nof the same year, Victorio and his people stole away from San Carlos,\r\nsaying they would rather die than live there. They were pursued by our\r\ncavalry, overtaken, and several of them killed; many women and children\r\nwere taken prisoners. The rest under Victorio, escaped, went to Fort\r\nWingate, and surrendered. They were sent back to Ojo Caliente, and held\r\nas prisoners of war until the order came from Washington for them to\r\nreturn to Arizona. Then they stole the cavalry horses and started on\r\nthe war-path.\r\n\r\nThe war was a series of ambuscades and retreats, lasting a year and a\r\nhalf. The details of Indian fighting are much the same everywhere; but\r\nApaches surpass in cunning, strategy, secrecy, all the sons of men.\r\nThey are an enemy not to be despised, and as friends are _never_ to\r\nbe trusted. Their signal system is so perfect that by it they act in\r\nperfect concert, and bands of fives, tens, and twenties, separated from\r\neach other by twenty, thirty, even forty miles, manage to maintain\r\na perfect police intelligence over the vast region once their own\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nVictorio had one son named for the man who, beyond all men of the\r\ncivilized and even savage world, has had the confidence of his kind,\r\nWashington; the one white man Indians admit to a place in their land\r\nof happy spirits. He was shot near Fort Cummings, and his death was\r\na heavy blow to the chief, whose fame and blanket he was to inherit,\r\nwhose pride was centered in his son. In the Fall of 1879, Washington’s\r\nbody lay unburied in the deep defile where he fell; the long hair\r\nmatted and dried with blood, the flesh shrunken and skin tanned like\r\nold leather. In the dry, dewless air of New Mexico, bodies are not\r\nsubject to decay as in the East, and will shrivel like a mummy by\r\nexposure to sun and wind. Long before this time the flesh of the\r\nchief’s son has probably been gnawed clean from the bones by the\r\nravening mountain wolf.\r\n\r\nWashington had but one wife, contrary to the usual custom of his tribe,\r\nand at twenty, wooed and won the “Princess,” as we used to call her,\r\nbecause she was of the royal family of the illustrious Magnus Colorado.\r\nShe was a comely damsel, very young, who assumed some dignity and state\r\nbecause of her high blood, and she never forgot the ancient splendors\r\nof her line.\r\n\r\nVictorio and his band were surrounded and killed in the Castillos\r\nMountains of Mexico, by troops under General Terassas (Mexican), and\r\nthe war ended with a grand parade in the city of Chihuahua. Cathedral\r\nbells rang, bands played, and the victorious column marched the street\r\namid rousing cheers. Following General Terassas and his command came\r\nprisoners, women and children on mules and ponies; they were to be\r\ngiven away and find homes among their conquerors. Behind them were\r\nseventy-eight Mexicans, carrying poles twenty feet high, on which were\r\nscalps dangling like waving plumes. The whole head of hair was torn off\r\ninstead of one tuft, and the slayer of Victorio, a Farhumara Indian\r\nbore aloft with pride a pole on which hung the gray scalp of the dead\r\nchief. At sight of it the cheers of the Mexicans were redoubled, and I\r\ncould but think so barbaric a procession is rarely seen in one of the\r\noldest and wealthiest cities of the North American Continent. There\r\nwas great cause for rejoicing; the bravest and wiliest of the Apaches\r\nwas dead, and he had no son to succeed him, for with Victorio’s death\r\nthe cause was lost. His wife cut off her hair, as the old Greek wives\r\nused to, and buried it, an offering to the spirit of the fallen chief\r\nto whom she was devoted, yet said to be less slavish than most Indian\r\nwives.\r\n\r\nVictorio’s band were all stout fighters and _devilish_ when under the\r\ninfluence of whiskey or _tiswin_, an intoxicating drink made from corn.\r\nOne of them, Rafael, split his child’s head open with an ax, when\r\ndrunk; another time stabbed his wife so that she died. He was then\r\novercome by penitence, sacrificed all of his beads and most of his\r\nclothes to the dear departed, cut his and children’s hair short, and\r\nsheared the horses’ manes and tails. These manifestations of anguish\r\nover, he went up into a high hill, and howled with uplifted hands.\r\nThat shape, outlined against the intense azure of the sky, was a most\r\nridiculous sight. The funeral dirge was a long, slow, horrible wail.\r\nThere is no Apache law to touch such a criminal; and this case is less\r\ndistressing than one other which came under my notice in New Mexico.\r\nAn old Indian bought a young girl of her mother, paying her price in\r\nponies and blankets--much against her will--she, like a sensible girl,\r\npreferring a younger man. She ran away, and hid in dark cañons and\r\npine woods, but the bridegroom tracked her and beat her on her head\r\nwith his gun for running off; and, worst of all, her mother thought\r\nthe son-in-law was exactly right in the matter. Finally, when her\r\nskull was nearly broken, her spirit was entirely gone, and she yielded\r\nto the inevitable, as so many women of the higher grade have done,\r\nand silently took up the heavy burden of life allotted the wife of\r\nthe most barbarous of barbarians. Women are of so little account with\r\nthese people that few of their daughters are given a name, and even\r\ntheir mothers often mourn at their birth, regarding them merely as an\r\nincumbrance on the tribe. They are pretty as children, but the exposure\r\nand hard work of their lot change them to wrinkled, muscular hags at\r\nthirty, and when they die the Apache chief merely says: “It was only a\r\nwoman; no loss.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. OLD MINERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOblivion scattereth her poppies even in guarded chambers where the Muse\r\nof History holds sleepless watch, and the broken, disconnected annals\r\nof New Mexico in the seventeenth century are like dreamy legends or\r\nmisty fables of the heroic ages.\r\n\r\nThe avaricious and despotic governors of the province made no secret\r\nof their odious laws, and appalling atrocities are put on record in\r\nbusiness manner, without concealment or attempt at palliation. Many\r\ndetails are trivial and there are long catalogues readable by no man\r\nbut Dr. Dryasdust. Running through dispatches is an appeal for money,\r\npetitions for appropriation the keynote of official song, from the\r\nEmpress of India down to the lowest official of the youngest republic.\r\nHow could the commandants open mines, develop the resources of Nueva\r\nMejico, even with slave labor, without money or its equivalent? Beside\r\nthis familiar wail are found meager and detached accounts of long\r\nmarches among the peace-loving Pueblos, who hailed the fair strangers\r\nas gods, and their horses as beautiful, immortal animals, tamed for the\r\nservice of their celestial visitants. These\r\n\r\n  ----“most Gothic gentlemen of Spain”\r\n\r\nwere no believers in the rolling-stone theory. We think of them as\r\nfilled with restless energy; but in a half sheet of ancient MS. I\r\nfind this item, made probably by a peevish Churchman, soured because\r\nhe missed promotion: “Our captains were great enemies to all kinds of\r\nlabor. They taught that gold was good for sore eyes and disease of the\r\nheart. Their desire for it was such they would enter into the infernal\r\nregions and cross the three rivers of hell to obtain it.” One Captain\r\nSalazar, in the Valley of the Del Norte, caught a _cacique_ [chief]\r\nand chained him, to make him tell where certain treasure was hidden.\r\nAfter holding the savage in confinement several months, the Christian\r\nput him to torture; but without avail. “We then let him go,” said the\r\nhistorian, dryly; “for the miserable heathen could not tell what he did\r\nnot know.”\r\n\r\nThe blood of the Christian of that age ran riot with the lust of gold\r\nand power; the two passions swaying men of mature years, tempered in\r\nyouth by the soft influence of love. It is easy to understand that the\r\nPueblo Indians, who were making some approaches to civilization in the\r\nmidst of savagery, then wore a yoke to which the iron collar of thrall\r\nworn by Gurth, the swineherd, was light as a lady’s necklace.\r\n\r\nHistory holds no deeper tragedy than the record of foreign invasion\r\nin North America. The man on horseback assumed that slavery was\r\nnecessary, therefore right, therefore just; and by the grace of God\r\n(which meant the iron hand in the glove of steel) he rewarded captains\r\nand corporals with lands wide as whole counties, as yet unmapped and\r\nunsubdued. His first object was to pile high and yet higher the riches\r\nwhich maintained the splendor of his house. The old Castilian had the\r\npsychic identities of the modern one--pride, vanity, intolerance,\r\negotism, hatred of labor, and fondness for bloody sports. In the\r\nirresponsible positions held by the local tyrants in Nueva Espagna\r\nthere was boundless sweep for gratification of these traits. Whatever\r\nwas not Romish or Spanish they regarded with haughty scorn. Adventurers\r\nthose colonists were, but adventurers of no common order. The spirit\r\nof Crusades was yet alive, and each man felt himself a champion of\r\nthe Cross, and with his sword of matchless temper vowed to strike a\r\nblow for Holy Church. Conversion was ever a prime object with the\r\n_Conquistador_. The saintly Isabella had it always at heart, and one of\r\nthe latest acts of her reign was to commend to the fathers the souls\r\nof her unbelieving subjects across the sea. The fanatic zeal of the\r\n_padres_ reached through every grade, and the _hidalgos_ gloried in the\r\ntitle “Swords of the Church.” The temples of sin, as the little mud\r\n_estufas_, or chapels, of the Indians were called, must be leveled,\r\nfalse gods and altar-fires overthrown, and the heathen brought to the\r\ntrue faith, under their converting steel. The earliest revolt of the\r\nPueblos, after the first conquest, grew out of the whipping of forty\r\nnatives, because they refused to accept the new religion and bow to the\r\nhated cross of the unseen God of the stranger.\r\n\r\nThe early colonists were all miners; but, owing to the care taken\r\nin concealments of them by the natives, little is left to indicate\r\noperations, except miles of earth cut into running galleries and\r\ndriven tunnels. Slavery everywhere, when applied to field labor, is\r\ndestructive to human life. What must it have been when directed to\r\nmining, under taskmasters who did not value one life at a pin’s fee?\r\n\r\nEven with the aid of science, machinery, and the many humanities of\r\nthe nineteenth century, it is still the most melancholy of trades. The\r\ntask of him who “hangs in midway air” to gather samphire is not half so\r\ndreadful as work done in danger from every element.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of a large prison among the placers of the Mimbres Mountains,\r\nabandoned mines reopened, and traditions of Indians clearly show that\r\nthe conquered races were treated as though they did not belong to the\r\nhuman family. There is infinite pathos in the banishment of the untamed\r\nIndian from the free Sierras and the glad sunshine to gloomy caverns,\r\nwhere thousands were actually buried alive. They were driven to toil\r\nunder the lash and at the bayonets’ point; in peril from falling walls,\r\ndeadly gas, sudden floods, and the work was done by manual labor alone.\r\nThey broke the rocks with miserable tools and insufficient light, and\r\nmixed the ores slowly and painfully with naked feet. Quartz was ground\r\nin rude _arrastres_, or mills to which men and women were yoked like\r\ncattle. Every ounce of precious metal was literally the price of blood.\r\n\r\nSo changeless are the Spaniard and the Indian that the description of\r\na miner near Chihuahua, written last year, will do tolerably well for\r\nthe Pueblo of the seventeenth century. Then, as now, the Spaniard was\r\nthe overseer. The peon is the slave of to-day. As a rule, Mexicans,\r\nhowever intelligent and educated, have no genius for machinery. They\r\nblow, crush, and drill as their fathers did before them, and for\r\ntransportation of ore they prefer a train of mules to a train of cars.\r\nThe miner in the sepulchral shades of San Domingo has never heard\r\nof crushing-mills or cars. A yard-square piece of untanned hide,\r\nstretched on two sticks, is his wheelbarrow. The drill, the pick, the\r\ncrowbar are his only tools. Out of the black door of the mine he steps\r\nquickly, lightly, though weighted by a sack containing a hundred and\r\nfifty pounds of ore. A broad band of rawhide attaches the burden to\r\nhis forehead. He is naked as when he came into the world. His neck and\r\nlimbs are like a prize-fighter’s. The perspiration streams from his\r\nsooty face and body, and his breast heaves spasmodically. There are\r\nno air-shafts, and for two hours he has been down in the hydrogen of\r\nthe mine. The path he has travelled, in ascending, winds hither and\r\nthither; now up, then down; now in a chamber of whose extent he has\r\nno conception; now through a gallery narrow as the cavity of a sugar\r\nhogshead--so narrow that, to bear his cargo through, he must double and\r\ncrawl like a panther; now along a slippery ledge, where the slightest\r\nerror in the placement of a hand or foot is instant death, because on\r\none side is an abyss which for the matter of vision might as well be\r\nfathomless. Now it turns a sharp corner; now it traverses rough masses\r\nof rocks, which are not all _débris_ from blasting, for some of them\r\nhave tumbled from the roof, and may be followed by “companion pieces”\r\nat any moment. Woe to him whom they catch! Thus for more than half an\r\nhour the poor wretch has come. To such a feat, performed regularly six\r\ntimes a day, what is crossing the rapids of Niagara on a wire? What\r\nwonder that the breast heaves and the sweat pours? Have you not heard a\r\nman escaped from drowning tell of the agony thrilling him the instant\r\nthe life-saving air rushed into the cells of his collapsed lungs?\r\nSomething like that this poor miner and his comrades say they suffer\r\nevery time they pass the door of the mine, suddenly into the rarefied\r\natmosphere of the upper world. Horrible life! And how wretchedly\r\nrewarded! Between mining and morals there is no connection, still the\r\nquestion comes: Was it for this God gave him a soul?\r\n\r\nThe man’s first act, on stepping into daylight, is to snatch the little\r\ntallow-dip from its perch on his head and blow it out. It cost him a\r\n_claco_ only; but it was such a friend down in Tartarus! Without it,\r\ncould he have ever risen to the light? As its glimmer came dancing up\r\nthe rugged way, how the darkness parted before him and the awaiting\r\ngulfs revealed themselves! He proceeds next to the door of the roofless\r\nhouse. A man meets him, helps him unload, takes the sack to a rough\r\ncontrivance and weighs it, giving a ticket of credit. Not a word is\r\nspoken. They are like gliding ghosts. Resuming the emptied sack, the\r\nnaked wretch turns, walks quickly to the entrance of the mine, lights\r\nthe friendly taper, looks once\r\n\r\n   ----“to sun, and stream, and plain,\r\n  As what he ne’er might see again,”\r\n\r\nre-enters the rocky jaws, and wades back through the inner darkness.\r\nYet he is not alone. He is a type. He has comrades whom he will meet on\r\nthe way; comrades in the extremest pit, wherein the sounds of rueful\r\nlabor are blended with mournful talk.\r\n\r\nThe friction of the coming and going of miners has polished the\r\nslippery floor to glassy smoothness. With the help of guides, we\r\ndescended the black pit, and deep in the heart of the mountain sought\r\nthe men at work. The wretched candle each one carried served not so\r\nmuch to illuminate our way as it appeared to burn a little hole in\r\nthe darkness. Perspiration fairly rained from us; but we came to see,\r\nand pushed on in the black solitude, till strength and courage almost\r\nfailed. At last we observed, far off to our right, a light dimly\r\nreddening the rocky wall. Miners at work! Good! Just what we came\r\nfor. Slowly, carefully, painfully we drew near the beacon. There was\r\nno sound of voices, no ring of hammers, nor echo of blows. A solitary\r\nworkman was playing the mystic art. He had not heard our approach, and\r\nwe stopped to observe him before speaking. A little basket at his left\r\ncontained a few tallow dips and some _tortillas_. Close by, in position\r\nto illuminate brightly about two feet of the wall directly in front of\r\nhim, was his lighted candle. A pile of fine crushed ore, the result of\r\nhis labor, covered the floor to his right, and on it lay an iron bar\r\nand a pick. Above him extended a vault in the darkness without limit.\r\nHe had come there about the break of day in the upper world. He came\r\nalone, and alone he had remained. Not a word had he heard, not one\r\nspoken. The candles not merely lightened his labor: but, since each one\r\nwould burn about so long--a certain number exhausting by noon, another\r\nbringing the night--they also kept his time. The solitude was awful! In\r\nthe uncertain light the naked, crouching body seemed that of an animal.\r\nWe spoke to him. The voice was kindly, yet it sounded in his ears, so\r\nlong attuned to silence, like a pistol-shot. He started up in attitude\r\nof defense. He may be squatted at the base of the same wall to-day.\r\nPity for him, wherever he is! Pity for all of his craft!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. THE NEW MINERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe modern Mexican is true to the traditions of old Spain--jealous of\r\nforeigners, opposed to change, ever copying the past.\r\n\r\nThere is a legend across the waters that one morning, not a great\r\nwhile ago, the glorious angel who keeps the keys of the viewless gate\r\ngave Adam permission to come back and look after his farm. Watched by\r\nGabriel, chief of the guard angelic, the spirit (oldest of all created,\r\nyet forever young) dropped through the silent starry spaces, among\r\nrushing planets and blazing suns, numbered only in Heaven, poised above\r\nthe Alps, and looked over Germany. The men were smoking meerschaums,\r\ndrinking beer, and talking metaphysics. Disgusted, he fled in swift\r\nflight toward France. There he saw nothing but polite frivolities. The\r\nsoul of our common ancestor was saddened. France was even worse than\r\nGermany. He did not linger. Taking wing while morn still purpled the\r\neast, he crossed the mountains into Spain, and, resting incumbent on\r\nair, surveyed the kingdom. One glance across it sufficed. The spirit\r\nfolded his radiant wings. “Ah!” he cried, enraptured. “Home again!\r\nHere all is just as I left it.” This old story well illustrates the\r\ninfluence of Iberian aversion to change, which has been felt wherever\r\nSpain has had a lasting foothold in the New World. The antiquated\r\nmining implements of the by-gone generations of New Mexico are\r\nthe queerest things in the world to the Leadviller, used to the\r\nponderous quartz mills, driven by invisible power, moving like a free\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nWhen the mines in the Placer Mountains, thirty miles southwest of\r\nthe City of Holy Faith, were in operation, they were worked by the\r\nold-fashioned Spanish _arrastre_, the rudest, most wasteful of mining\r\nmachines. It consists in nothing more than two large flat stones,\r\nattached to a horizontal beam and drawn around by a mule (in the days\r\nof slavery by men and women), upon a bed of flat stones. The process\r\nof grinding the ore was slow, the amalgamation imperfect, and not more\r\nthan one-third of the gold could be separated from the quartz.\r\n\r\nThere is good reason for believing that mines near Santa Fé were worked\r\nin this way before Hudson entered the river which bears his name. They\r\nwere probably _en bonanza_ in the years when the great Queen, steering\r\nthe English ship through stormy seas, paused amid the breakers to\r\nlisten to the wooing of Robert Dudley.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniard in that day mined with stone hammers, and it is surprising\r\nto us they could sink deep shafts with such wretched appliances.\r\nThey were ignorant of carbonates of silver, and took nothing but the\r\nargentiferous galena from the vein, throwing away nine-tenths of the\r\nbest-paying mineral. There is little statistical knowledge of the\r\nworking of any one mine in this territory, but old Church records are\r\nsaid to show that the ten per cent. in tithes collected for it amounted\r\nto about ten millions. This was realized from mines adjacent to Santa\r\nFé. In each of the ravines running into the Cañada de las Minas (Glen\r\nof Mines) more or less of “float” is found. This is silver-bearing\r\ngalena ore, washed from lodes crossing the ravines, and is certain\r\nindication of silver leads in close vicinity.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, when Gen. Kearney took possession of Santa Fé nearly all the\r\nminers left the placers, never to return. Many reasons are given for\r\ntheir hasty flight, one of which is that, being Mexicans, they feared\r\nimpressment into the American service, and escaped while they could.\r\nIt is believed that mining operations in the height of prosperity then\r\nsuddenly stopped, as the abandoned and decaying town of Francisco near\r\nby shows; and but little has since been done to revive the business\r\nuntil within the last few years.\r\n\r\nLos Cerillos Mines, now being rapidly opened up, are in a chain of\r\nlow conical mountains north of the Galisteo, twenty miles from the\r\ncapital city. In these ranges are found syenitic rocks, carboniferous\r\nlimestone and sandstone formations, the latter containing coal. They\r\nare traversed for thirty or forty miles with valuable lodes, the veins\r\nrunning from the northeast to the southwest, and almost daily fresh\r\n“Spanish traces,” old workings, come in sight, to cheer the heart of\r\nthe prospector. After the rebellion of 1680 the Indians returned to\r\ntheir pueblos and submitted to the foreign yoke, on condition that\r\nmines should not be reopened. It would appear the treaty was kept in\r\ngood faith, and that the very ancient mines remained untouched during\r\nthe subsequent period of Spanish rule. Some of these old diggings in\r\nLos Cerillos have been so carefully concealed that it requires the\r\nkeenest scrutiny to find them. The shaft of the Santa Rosa Mine, on\r\nreöpening, was found to have been sunk fifty-five feet. One shaft is\r\none hundred and sixty-five feet to water. How much deeper no man can\r\ntell. The _débris_ and precious mineral were carried up on the backs of\r\n_peones_, and the notched cedar trees which were their only ladders two\r\nhundred years ago are still the means of descent to the venturesome\r\ntraveler, exploring the rediscovered galleries.\r\n\r\nThe early proprietaries followed no rules in prospecting. They were\r\nled by whim, or most frequently by dreams, the medium of communication\r\npreferable to the patron saints. The most prejudiced observer can\r\nnot help admiring the boldness and energy of their movements. And\r\nthe fields are just as rich to-day. If they paid under such feeble,\r\nunskilled management, they must be much more profitable now, with the\r\nhelp of science and delicate machinery. For three hundred years and\r\nmore the sands have been washed out at the base of Los Cerillos; but\r\nnot until very recently have those washing for precious grains of metal\r\nthought of looking to the _source_, the core of the mountains, for the\r\nbest deposits. This was the process of experiment and experience in the\r\ngreat California Gulch at Leadville.\r\n\r\nIn these volcanic hills, still bearing marks of the fiery lava\r\nflow, are the Montezuma Turquoise Mines, which are marvels of deep\r\nexcavation. In one instance half a mountain is cut away by Indians of\r\nthe pre-historic period, in their search for the coveted, the priceless\r\n_chalchuite_, the Aztecan diamond.\r\n\r\nThe tradition runs that anciently the gold and silver-bearing ores were\r\nborne on the backs of _burros_ to Chihuahua, Mexico (six hundred miles\r\naway), for reduction; that long trains of the patient creatures, lean,\r\nthirsty, and beaten with many stripes, were perpetually coming and\r\ngoing along the Valley del Norte, curtaining it with clouds of yellow\r\ndust.\r\n\r\nIt seems a baseless tradition. If the gold-hunters could reduce their\r\nores in Chihuahua, why not in Santa Fé as well? In 1867 the larger\r\nportion of El Palacio, then standing, was cleared away, and, among\r\nmany curious relics brought to light, after long burial, was a clumsy\r\nsmelting furnace, thoroughly bricked up on every side and worn with\r\nlong and hard usage. From its ashes were taken out bits of charcoal,\r\nshowing clearly that ages ago, time out of mind, the Spaniards\r\ndiscovered and used it in smelting their ores.\r\n\r\nThe ancient method of washing for silver was a very simple process. The\r\noperator required nothing but a crowbar, a shovel, and a tanned skin.\r\nThis last he fashioned into a water-tight basin by stretching it upon a\r\nsquare frame. Filling it with water, he stood over it, rocking in it a\r\nlittle tub holding sand and grit, from which, washed free of clay and\r\nearth, he separated the worthless pebbles, and selected the valuable\r\nparticles.\r\n\r\nIn old ranches through the country we occasionally see an antique\r\ncandlestick of beaten silver, or a salt-cellar of hammered\r\n_plata_--heirlooms proving that in long-gone generations silver was\r\nfound and in quantities.\r\n\r\nAsk how old they are, and the ever-ready “_Quien sabe_” is the answer.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the seventeenth till the eighteenth century there\r\nwas a rapid succession of rebellions and civil wars, with Santa Fé as\r\nthe field and the important strategic point. In 1680 the Pueblos allied\r\nwith the Teguas--described as a nation of warriors--and routed the\r\nSpaniards, driving them from the land as far south as El Paso del Norte.\r\n\r\nAnother army was mustered and sent up from the City of Mexico, but\r\nfeared to take the offensive, and for twelve years the land had rest,\r\nwas quiet, as before the foreign invasion. It was in this interval of\r\ntwelve years that the ancient mines were hidden. All the old mineral\r\nworkings were covered and carefully concealed, and death was the\r\npenalty for any who should reveal to white men where precious metals\r\nor stones were to be found. After 1692 mining in the province was\r\nabandoned, and to this day it is the rarest thing for a Spaniard or an\r\nIndian to engage in mining. They seem to have forsaken it forever.\r\n\r\nIt is said that in the whole compass of East Indian literature there\r\nis not a single passage showing a love of liberty. The millions\r\nappear created for the gratification of one man. If the West Indian\r\nbe, indeed, his brother, then were brothers never so unlike. To the\r\nNorth American, freedom is the very breath of his nostrils, and the\r\ndegradation of slavery worse than slow torture or sudden death.\r\n\r\nIn irrepressible yearning for liberty the Pueblos escaped from mines,\r\nsuch as I have attempted to describe, to inaccessible mountain\r\nfastnesses, the steeps of distant cañons and hiding-places in dens of\r\nanimals. How many perished in these realms of silence and despair none\r\nbut the recording angel can testify. The polished armor of the invaders\r\ncovered hearts hard as triple brass, and silken banners floated over\r\nknights whose avarice was equalled only by their cruelty. The fugitives\r\nwere tracked and hunted down with bloodhounds, as though they were\r\nbeasts of prey.\r\n\r\nAs has been written of the same tragedy then being enacted in Peru:\r\n“It was one unspeakable outrage, one unutterable ruin, without\r\ndiscrimination of age or sex. From hiding-places in the clefts of rocks\r\nand the solitude of invisible caves, where there was no witness but\r\nthe all-seeing sun, there went up to God a cry of human despair.” The\r\nBishop of Chiapsa, himself a Spaniard, affirms that more than fifteen\r\nmillions were cut off in his time, slaves of the mines. On the Northern\r\nContinent history is but an imperfect guide. That the rich valleys of\r\nthe Rio Grande and the Pecos once held a dense population is plainly\r\nproved by the ruins of cities slowly crumbling away. We have only dim\r\nglances into long, dark spaces; but there is light enough to see the\r\nconqueror’s daily walk was on the necks of the conquered natives, who\r\nswiftly declined to an abject and heart-broken race.\r\n\r\nSo great was the horror of the first conquest that the memory of it\r\nhas been kept alive through ten generations. The Pueblo mother still\r\nshudders as she tells the story of ancient wrong and woe to her\r\nchildren; and the unwritten law yet binds the red race to secrecy, and\r\nis a hindrance in the opening of mines in the territories.\r\n\r\nPrincely fortunes were made, and, if tribes, whole nations, were swept\r\noff the face of the earth; they were but so many heathen less to cumber\r\nthe ground and drag the march of conquest. To understand how valueless\r\nhuman life was then, look down the steep sides of the old mines\r\nreopened. Rows of cedar pegs serve, you see, as ladders along the black\r\nwalls, from the bottom to the entrance. Imagine a man climbing up,\r\nweighted with a sack containing a hundred pounds of ore, fastened to\r\nhis back by a broad band of raw-hide across his forehead. The slightest\r\nerror in the placement of hand or foot must miss the hold, and the\r\nburden-bearer be dashed to pieces; but it could have been no loss, else\r\nbetter means would have been provided. There must have been hundreds at\r\nhand to take his place.\r\n\r\nWhen did Spain stretch forth her hand, except to scatter curses? It\r\nis part of my faith, derived from the study of history--in fact, it\r\nis the great lesson of history--that nations are punishable, like\r\nindividuals, and that for every national sin there is, soon or late, a\r\nnational expiation. Does not Spain place the doctrine beyond question?\r\nNo European power has had such opportunities for noble achievement; yet\r\nwhat good has come through her? What grand idea or benign principle,\r\nwhat wholesome impression upon mankind? She was the Tarshish of\r\nSolomon; her mines were the subject of quarrel between the Roman and\r\nCarthagenian; in the day of Christ she still supplied the world with\r\nthe royal metals. Such were her resources in the beginning. Afterwards,\r\nwhen commerce reached out through the Pillars of Hercules and drew the\r\nWest in under its influences, a people of masterful genius sitting\r\nwhere Europe bends down so close to Africa, would have stretched a gate\r\nfrom shore to shore and by it ruled the earth.\r\n\r\nYet later she received the gift of the New World. Where is the trophy\r\nmarking her beneficent use of the gift? She had already ruined the\r\ncivilization which had its sea in the pillared shades of the Alhambra.\r\nIn her keeping were placed the remains of the Aztec and the relics of\r\nthe Incas, only to be destroyed. Drunk with the blood of nations, she\r\nwho ruthlessly subjected everything to the battle-ax, the rack, and the\r\ntorch is now dying of slow decay.\r\n\r\nCould the breath blow from the four winds and breathe upon the Indians,\r\nreckoned by millions, who perished under Spanish rule; if their dust\r\ncould but come together, and all those slain live again and testify,\r\nalas! for Castelar, wisest of visionaries, awaiting the Republic of\r\nEurope to bring about the resurrection of his country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. THE HONEST MINER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man on the frontier who has no speculation in his eyes is dead as\r\nBanquo. The contagion of soul, says the ancient philosopher, is quicker\r\nthan that of the body, and I have yet to see the one with soul so dead\r\nas to refuse a venture in mines, and wholly resist the fever which\r\nspares neither age nor sex, yet is not fatal or even unpleasant. While\r\nthe craze lasts, it affects the brain, quickening the imagination and\r\ndistorting the vision. Under its powerful alchemy discolored stones by\r\nthe wayside become bowlders of ore, it seams bare cliffs with veins of\r\ngleaming metal, plants mines in impossible places, converts vertical\r\nstrata into immense deposits. All the way it silvers the dreams of\r\nnight and lengthens them unbroken into the day. Knowledge comes to the\r\nfever-smitten without study. One glance at a lofty mountain-range is\r\nsufficient to determine if it be metalliferous, and, balancing a lump\r\nof ore on his gritty forefinger, he can tell its exact per cent. of\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nThe victim of the epidemic carries scraps of grimy stuff in his\r\npockets, wrapped in dirty cloths, and a small magnifying glass, into\r\nwhich he puckers his fevered eyes many times in the twenty-four\r\nhours, and surveys his uncoined treasure with doating glances. He\r\nunselfishly allows confidential friends to look through the lens, and\r\nexpects enthusiastic admiration in return for the privilege. Unless\r\nthe confidential friend is an enemy in disguise, he will gloat over\r\nthe earthy specimens too. He talks little, if at all, apparently\r\nin a generous burst of feeling about bonanzas. _En bonanza_ means\r\nliterally smooth sailing, a fair breeze, etc., and is used by Mexican\r\nminers, applied to exceedingly rich ores or “shoots.” Free translation,\r\n“booming.” His voice is pitched in a low key--a loud, impressive, I may\r\nsay distracting whisper. The delirium is pleasurable, for the man’s\r\nhopes are indomitable, and a secret trust covers a dark stratum, so\r\nto speak, of fear; but he is reticent, grave as though his shafts had\r\npierced to the very center of gravity.\r\n\r\nThe arithmetic man, who loves figures, has estimated that in the flush\r\ntimes of Colorado the successful were one to every five hundred honest\r\nminers. He has not brought in returns from the territories, and there\r\nis, in consequence, broader sweep for imagination in the undeveloped\r\nregions, where mining is yet partly experiment.\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of two or three millionaires balance the losses of\r\nthousands, like the many deaths which go to make up a victory. Are\r\nyou the five hundredth or eight hundredth happy child of Destiny,\r\nthe victorious captain for whom the unnamed heroes fell? YOU? Of the\r\nbonanza king we daily hear by telegraph, photograph, autograph. Of the\r\nvast army of the defeated--nothing. Singly they tramp back home, steal\r\nin darkly at dead of night, ravage the pantry, and, having slept off\r\nfatigue, are ready to deny having thought of Leadville and Golden.\r\n\r\nOne of the cheapest and easiest ways of reaching a mine is by a\r\n“grubstake.” This euphonious word means a certain sum (say one hundred\r\nand eighty dollars) advanced to a man by another, with more money\r\nand less time, and the prospector has an interest in whatever he may\r\nfind. You meet him on every road, every highway, every by-way, and\r\nwhere there is no way in the territories. The prospective millionaire\r\ngenerally wears an umbrageous hickory shirt, sleeves usually rolled\r\nto the elbow, exposing arms not the fairest, buckskin or brown duck\r\npants, or a ready-made suit, ready to be unmade at the seams, and\r\na hat of superlative slouch. His head is shaggy as a buffalo’s,\r\nwith sun-scorched hair, and his face, lined with fierce sunbeat and\r\nwrinkling wind, is a glossy red, as though it had been veneered,\r\nsand-papered, and varnished. He carries a striking hammer, weighing\r\nfrom five to eight pounds. Does it look like an enchanter’s rod?\r\nIn his hand it may prove a fairy wand, potent as the double-headed\r\nhammer of Thor. His _burro_, or donkey, is not much larger than a\r\nsheep, yet able to bear three hundred pounds’ weight. On the patient,\r\nlong-suffering brute is strapped a blanket. Above it are piled rations\r\nof bacon, sugar, crackers, a pick and shovel, and a tin pot for boiling\r\na coarse brown powder, called in bitter (very bitter) sarcasm coffee.\r\nIn seeking claims, he is oftenest attended by a partner, familiarly and\r\naffectionately called “my pard.” In this land of sudden death, where\r\nevery man carries pistols and loves to use them, one lone prospector\r\nmay be picked off almost anywhere, and his bones left in deep cañon or\r\nlonesome gulch, and no questions asked. It is best to hunt in couples.\r\nLike the intelligent and reliable contraband of other days, the honest\r\nminer is forever bringing in good news. “Lee is just where we want\r\nhim!” “The latest find is prodigious, the best thing yet, and lacks\r\nnothing but capital for development to equal anything in the Comstock\r\nLode or Santa Eulalia!” This last is a mine worth having, where the\r\nearly diggers set no value on common ore, but sought “pockets,” rich\r\nwith silver; a soft yellow clay, scooped out rapidly and easily with\r\nhorn spoons. Sometimes they were of immense extent, requiring years to\r\nexhaust.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to learn why the miner is always named the\r\nhonest miner; but such is the fact. To this well-worn adjective are\r\nsometimes added reticent and successful, when the speaker wishes to be\r\nunusually impressive. It has been written that mining speculations,\r\nlike transactions in horse-flesh, have a tendency to blunt moral\r\nperceptions, and soured politicians insinuate it was first phrased by\r\nambitious patriots who were anxious to secure his suffrage. Be that as\r\nit may, the honest miner is our man now. Though he does not pretend\r\nto be a poet, his is the vision and faculty divine. He is attended by\r\npresences to other eyes unseen, like the inspired sculptor, who in\r\na heavenly fervor of inspiration hewed the rough block of marble by\r\nthe roadside and let the prisoned angel out. By break of day, while\r\nthe warm valley still holds the night in its bosom, he is up and on\r\nthe march. The shadow of a great rock or a sighing pine has been his\r\nshelter, the overarching blue canopy his tent, the world is his field.\r\nFor his unfailing appetite there are crackers, bacon, and coffee.\r\nLike Macaulay’s fellow-traveler, he breakfasts as if he had fasted\r\nthe day before, and dines as though he had never breakfasted. His\r\n_burro_ is happy as that melancholy beast can be on a little grama\r\ngrass (_Ætheroma oligistarchon_) or twigs and leaves of scrub oak. He\r\nwanders from the borderline northward, among cold, sharp, icy crags,\r\nwhere desolation dwells in matchless state; where, among treeless, bald\r\npeaks, she holds and guards her Paradise, perfect even to the grim,\r\npainted savage, who, with scalping-knife, instead of flaming sword,\r\ndoes the duty of the sentinel-angel at the gate. Lava-beds do not stop\r\nhim, nor chaparral, mezquit, or cactus jungle, or the pricking “Spanish\r\nbayonet.” In withering wind, in blinding snow and drifting sand, the\r\nundaunted fellow pushes his search for rich leads. Such persistent\r\nenergy directed to any other business would command success; but will\r\nit in prospecting? That depends. If he fails in finding a good thing\r\n(say a lode worth a million or so) in a given district, it does not\r\nshake his steadfast confidence. He makes a new deal, and begins again,\r\nfor he “is bound to spot the treasure.”\r\n\r\nThe claim-stake is usually a pine board, marked with certain\r\ninscriptions in pencil, which ooze from within glazes over and makes\r\nindelible. Pleasant and consoling to him is it to know that no wise man\r\nfrom the East--no scientist, no geologist--has ever found a valuable\r\nmine. “Them literary fellows have to take a back seat” when it comes to\r\nlocating a claim. Luck, chance, accident, and the prospector are the\r\npowers to be depended upon then. But when he does strike the big lead,\r\nand the crumbly ore, with its glittering white-and-yellow streakings,\r\nis reported inexhaustible then these wholesome adages floor the honest\r\nminer. A man cannot see very far underground. It takes a mine to work a\r\nmine. Luck may find the lead, but science molds the silver brick; and\r\nto these precious truths are added the proverb so dear to gentlemen of\r\nthe profession of the renowned Oakhurst: “There’s nothing certain about\r\nluck, except that it’s bound to change.”\r\n\r\nThe old Spaniards had the national love of gambling--the gambler’s\r\nunreasoning hope and his blind belief in luck. If Fortune frowned\r\nto-day, she would brightly smile across the green cloth to-morrow. If\r\ngold is not in this glittering, cheating mica, it is hidden elsewhere,\r\nawaiting him who is bold enough to risk the chances of winning. The\r\nsame trait is deeply marked in the American of our generation. Mining\r\nis a business to which all other occupations are dull and tame. The\r\nlumps of soft, blue-looking rock, not much harder than clay, streaked\r\nand spangled with shining threads, are dear to the American as they\r\nwere to the Castilian heart and eye.\r\n\r\nA man undertaking a scheme in which the odds are five hundred to one\r\nagainst success might be considered a simpleton elsewhere; but not so\r\non the frontier. Thousands, armed with pretended stoicism, fevered with\r\nanxiety, rush West, “to look into mines a little,” dig deep, and find\r\nat the bottom of the shaft what the gods of Olympus sent as underlying\r\nall the ills--Hope.\r\n\r\nIt is as certain as the sun rises and sets that the gambling and not\r\nthe commercial instinct predominates in mining transactions. The\r\nfascination is in the hazard. The spell, so binding usually, is not\r\nof avarice, but lies in that delicious, feverish, intoxicating _charm\r\nof chance_. To borrow the words of one who has tried it: “There is a\r\ndelight in its agony, a sweetness in its insanity, a drunken, glorious\r\nintensity of _sensation_ in its limitless swing between a prince’s\r\ntreasures and a beggar’s death, which lend life a sense never known\r\nbefore; rarely, indeed, once tasted, ever abandoned.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. THE ASSAYERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA certain room in El Palacio is devoted to assaying the precious ores.\r\nIts blackened, time-stained rafters look as though they might fall\r\nany moment; but believers in luck rest in calm assurance that the\r\ncatastrophe will not occur in their time. Vainly is the tale told how\r\nthe very day Governor Merriwether took possession of the Palace, to\r\nassume the executive duties of the territory, the roof of the room in\r\nwhich he had once been a prisoner fell in. Nobody scares at that old\r\nstory now. The slanting beam overhead will not drop till we are out of\r\nthe way; the crumbling adobes will hold together awhile yet. No use\r\nrunning till you are hurt. There is too much actual danger about us to\r\nallow the sensationalist a chance to waken fears.\r\n\r\nThe mud walls of the room I speak of were once papered; but the hanging\r\nhas flaked off, revealing the brown ground, making splotches here and\r\nthere, like a disease. Cobwebs of pre-historic antiquity hang in lines,\r\nlike ropes of dirty rags. The one north window is obscured by dust and\r\nfly-specks, the dull panes and deep walls letting in a dim and not\r\nreligious light. It was formerly a bedroom, I believe. Of the living\r\nthings which still may burrow in the walls, as the French women say, I\r\nbeseech you to suppose them. The bare floor is dusty and gritty with\r\nsand. In one corner is a barrel of charcoal; beside it pine kindling\r\nand old newspapers. A long pine table holds the assayer’s tools--the\r\nmany contrivances necessary to his vocation. Scales that weigh with the\r\ndelicate nicety of Portia’s, blow-pipes, bottles of acids, mortar and\r\npestles, little hammers, and sieves, beside waiting specimens, done up\r\nin muslin, carefully separated and labeled. Such stones come in every\r\nmail, every train, every ambulance, every pocket. “Blossom rocks” adorn\r\nwindow-sill and mantelpiece, street-corners and counters, serve as\r\npaper-weights and door-props, and are a stumbling-block and rock of\r\noffense along the sidewalks.\r\n\r\nI am not here to talk of chlorides, pyrites, sulphurets, silica, and\r\nmanganese; but only to remark, _en passant_, that free gold and ruby\r\nsilver are pretty terms--very pretty, indeed--and easily understood by\r\nany lady in the land.\r\n\r\nAt this table presides the refiner and purifier of silver--the Man of\r\nDestiny. It may be a Freiburg professor, with flowing beard and a name\r\nin harsh discord with the mellifluous Spanish titles, or a graduate\r\nof a New York school of mines. No matter. He understands his business\r\nand on his fiat hang hopes high as the sky, for to him are submitted\r\nsamples of raw ores believed valuable, and now comes the question: Is\r\nthe deposit represented rich enough to justify deep digging--in other\r\nwords, to make a mine of? The honest miner’s flush of hope and sinking\r\nof fear are comparable only to the tremor of the quivering aspirant for\r\nliterary fame, who, with darling MS. in hand, respectfully addresses\r\nthe torturer, and withdraws to await his doom.\r\n\r\nThe small, square furnace glows with fervent heat, and the room is\r\nsuffocating. With beaded forehead and dripping chin, the assayer\r\nweighs, pulverizes, sifts the fine dust in the cupels, to undergo the\r\nonly sure test, the trial by fire. His hidden power revives the old\r\nromantic ideas of scholars, to whom the ancient and secret science\r\nof alchemy was a religion, part of the sublime, cabalistic wisdom\r\nrevealed unto Adam, to console him for the loss of Paradise; for which\r\nstudy philosophers shut themselves up to lifelong toil in cells and\r\ncaves. He is of the order of mystics, who grew lean and pale pondering\r\nbrass-bound volumes of wicked-looking hieroglyphs; who understood\r\nthe charm of the burning belt and the ciphered girdle. He deals with\r\nstrange crucibles and subtle compounds; by a wizard spell masters the\r\nforces of the earth, the transmutation of metals, and by magic numbers\r\ndiscovers the golden secrets of Nature. While the cabala combination is\r\nbeing applied, that laboratory is the center of many hopes.\r\n\r\nHow often, ah! _how_ often does it prove the gold is dull lead, the\r\nsilver is become dross. The waiting miner is “not in harmonization\r\nwith his environments.” He hovers about the Palace, trying to cover\r\nhis eager anxiety under the studied stoicism of the frontiersman.\r\nSometimes the sun looks down upon him, as it rises, and finds him a\r\npatient watcher, waiting for the cooling of the metal. He has silently\r\noutwatched the stars, only to learn that specimens believed very rich\r\n(his darling promises) are worthless--not a speck, not a pinhead of\r\nprecious mineral to be seen in a dozen cupels. What he held was so much\r\nfairy gold that turns to dust and dross.\r\n\r\nThe gold-seeker, in the first chill of disappointment, refuses to\r\ncredit the report; but the refiner’s furnace has spoken with tongues\r\nof fire. There is the evidence of his own senses; he cannot doubt the\r\ntestimony. He quickly recovers his stolid composure, takes a square\r\nmeal, possibly a square drink, and, led by the spirit of unrest, is\r\nready to face the inevitable hardships of another long search for rich\r\nleads.\r\n\r\nHe rises, after an adverse stroke of fate, buoyant as ever with\r\nirrepressible hope--as Dr. Johnson says of second marriages, “the\r\ntriumph of hope over experience.” In the morning the disappointment\r\nseems like something belonging to the vanished night. Five, eight, ten\r\nyears may have brought nothing but anxiety, excitement, ill-luck; but\r\nhis superior sagacity and daring _must_ win at last.\r\n\r\nAway he goes, with _burro_ and “pard,” off on another prospecting tour,\r\nacross unmeasured wastes of sand, under a brassy sky, over alkali\r\nplains, lava-beds, and waterless _pasturas_, which lead to springs that\r\nmay be poison.\r\n\r\nA childish credulity weakens the judgment of the honest miner. He\r\naccepts without reserve the pleasing myths which form a sort of\r\nlegendary history; the unwritten annals of gold and silver-bearing\r\nmountains. Airy fables, poetic traditions are received as authentic\r\nrecords. There are delightful touches in these tales, with which I\r\nshould love to embellish and enrich my page; but not to-day. They\r\nbelong to the mysteries and subtleties known only to the elect--the\r\nchosen few who see behind the cloud spanned with promise, iris-hued and\r\nglittering, the prize awaiting the venturesome Argonaut.\r\n\r\nThe pay-streak is possibly in a _vega_ of sea-like vastness and level;\r\nbut more likely in the stony mountain heart, threaded by shining lines,\r\nas the crimson veins warm ours. Wherever it is, he is the man to strike\r\nit. And this conviction abides with him, a constant happiness, as he\r\ntraverses the length and breadth of the mineral region.\r\n\r\nDo you laugh at his fond delusions?\r\n\r\nThe mania for precious metals is not a modern craze. It is older than\r\nthe Pyramids.\r\n\r\nIs he chasing a chimera?\r\n\r\nNo, dear reader, he is feeling his way in the checkered path which all\r\nmen at some period of their lives have sought ever since the first\r\nprospector groped along the strand down by the storied Euphrates, that\r\ndim and shadowy river, winding between myth and history, which waters\r\nthe old, old land Havilah, where there is gold.\r\n\r\nIf a cold-blooded newcomer advises the honest miner to settle down to\r\nsome good, steady, legitimate business, he rejects the idea with lofty\r\nscorn. That is well enough for the cautious idiot, who does not know\r\na true fissure-vein when he sees it. The every-day trades, the tame,\r\nbeaten paths are not in the prospector’s line of march. He is for the\r\nshort cut to fortune. Familiar with dangers, there is one foe he cannot\r\nfight. In lone hillsides and desolate cañons there is lying in wait for\r\nhim an enemy more deadly than the skulking Apache--a peculiar form of\r\nintermittent fever, called mountain fever. It lurks in the air, ready\r\nto lift the dread cloud hiding the mystery which forever enshrouds the\r\nUnseen World.\r\n\r\nThe human race is nomadic, and the old Aryan blood is strong, and\r\ncrops out on the _vegas_ of the Rocky Mountains clearly as on the arid\r\nplains of Mesopotamia. To be sure, in Adam we are all one, and he was\r\na quiet citizen of the world. In Noah we are all three, and after the\r\nDeluge--but this is getting into deep water.\r\n\r\n_Revenons._ Occasionally it happens that a sample of ore, “the\r\nqueer-looking stuff” on which moderate expectation is based, is brought\r\nout of the furnace, and the button in the cupel is not silver, but a\r\nlump of pure gold. O rapturous moment known to the few, the beloved\r\nchildren of Fate! O day to be remembered under the coffin-lid! The\r\nowner of such returns (not larger than a pea) treads on air. He tries\r\nto hide his exultation; but the secret will out. He plans; he builds.\r\nHe is going to sail the seas; to start before many days to hear the\r\nsyrens of the Mediterranean; to visit the abiding-places of poetry and\r\nhistory, the lands of undying summer; to see the kingdoms of the earth\r\nand the glory of them. And well may he dream dreams and see visions!\r\nMoney is but another name for freedom. He who holds it has all the\r\nworld before him where to choose his place of rest.\r\n\r\nMy reader, familiar with “The Last of the Barons,” may remember the\r\npicture of Adam Warner endeavoring to turn copper into gold. In the\r\nsolitude genius everywhere creates for itself, by night and by day,\r\nhanging over the burning Eureka, stinting himself and child to feed the\r\ndevouring furnace, asking no sympathy in his lonely chamber, living\r\napart with his works and fancies, like a god amidst his creations, and\r\ncoming very near the grand discovery concealed for a later generation\r\nto penetrate. The fascination of mining is what those elder sages\r\nexperienced in a lifelong witchery over minds bent to the study of\r\nalchemy. What wonder men were devoted to a pursuit, in which even Bacon\r\nand Newton wasted precious hours, which promised results so august?\r\nBesides costly chemicals, there were thrown into the crucibles youth,\r\nhealth, hope, love, yes, life itself, to vanish as vapor, slowly,\r\nslowly, surely, surely.\r\n\r\nThe worst thing about mining, as formerly about alchemy, is that it\r\nallures on its victims to destruction. One gets near and ever nearer\r\nthe object; so trifling a sum additional will complete the work and\r\nsecure the promise. Time, toil, expensive appliances are demanded; but\r\nthe glorious result justifies all these, and many another risk more\r\nfearful.\r\n\r\nNature has done in the Rocky Mountains precisely what the ancient sages\r\ntried to do. Here the last secret combination has produced the medium;\r\nthe striking hammer is smiting the rocks; in the death-like stillness\r\nof remote solitudes the blow reverbates, and at its compelling stroke\r\nthe earth opens, and lo! the philosopher’s stone is discovered.\r\nProspero’s wand was not mightier.\r\n\r\nAt night the clear, red glow of the furnace reddens the walls of the\r\nassayer’s room, coats with bright gilding gloomy rafters overhead, and\r\nlends a sickly light to the flickering flame of the coal-oil lamp.\r\nThen the place is suggestive of the great centre of the earth, where\r\ndoomed souls go wandering up and down in a joyless, endless wrestling\r\nwith fire. The silent men are like dismal ghosts. If they speak, it\r\nis in repressed tones. Their low voices, the obscurity of the room,\r\nthe intense heat, the air of secrecy and mystery give the feeling that\r\nsome agony is conducting--a battle, a fire, a drama involving high\r\ninterests. The mighty cause is a tragedy; possibly a crime.\r\n\r\nSometimes a woman, a girlish shape, looks in with innocent eyes, as\r\nthough she thought the assayer in woeful peril. She flits away like a\r\nspirit blest, wandering from the cool, sweet fields Elysian, to pity\r\nfor one moment the sad dwellers in the near purgatory.\r\n\r\nSouls in torment are here, in fact, when “specimens” on which star-high\r\nhopes were grounded prove to be fire-clay and galena, and the long,\r\nslow dream is as a vision of the night.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of some “miner men,” after a claim has been located, and\r\nthe one hundred dollars’ worth of work which the law exacts is done,\r\nis a study. In this age of doubt and question, their unwavering faith\r\ngives us fresh confidence in skeptical, sorely-tried human nature.\r\nThey gaze into narrow prospect-holes, about the size of a seventy-five\r\nbarrel cistern, with a depth of trust, an immovable resting on the\r\npromise in the future comparable with nothing I know, except the serene\r\ncomplacency of the setting hen. She feels the stir of life beneath her\r\nbrooding wings, and he has visions\r\n\r\n  ----“impalpable and unperceived\r\n  Of other’s sight.”\r\n\r\nYou see only a hole in the ground; a shallow cistern which holds no\r\nwater. Nature has revealed her secrets to him, as she does not to the\r\nunbeliever. Hence his robust faith.\r\n\r\nFrom that prospect-hole riches will roll up by the bucketful.\r\n\r\n“How will they get up?” asks the uninspired tourist, heartlessly.\r\n\r\nHonest miner, teetering a scrap of galena on his forefinger, stares\r\nsteadily at the faint mountain-line and murmurs: “Oh! I must bide my\r\ntime. One of these days capital will come along--capital will come\r\nalong--come along--along.”\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that capital is often a good while on the road.\r\nThis hour, scores about us are prospecting, opening abandoned workings,\r\nfollowing the ancient Tegua-Spanish traces, with hopeful hearts. They\r\nare enchanters. Hear them talk, and you behold the beauty of which they\r\ndream. They have neither crucibles nor carpet, nor do they pour ink in\r\nyour palm, as Hassan did; yet are they prophets and seers, and their\r\nvisions all foreshow another Leadville.\r\n\r\nThe Lodestone Rocks are not far off. Come not near, unless you are\r\nready to be dashed against them.\r\n\r\nOnly fifty dollars laid out in work, and a mine possibly worth\r\nthousands. _Quien sabe?_ “Who knows?” “Who knows?”\r\n\r\nTaking a stern Methodist view of the business as now proceeding in\r\nthe territories, I should call mining a game of chance--exciting,\r\nfascinating, bewildering--which defrauds no one but yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. THE RUBY SILVER MINE.--A TRUE STORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMining atmospheres are rife with stories, marvelous, startling, that\r\nwould be incredible, did we not know it is always the incredible which\r\nhappens. Of the many tales floating about Santa Fé, I give one to you,\r\nbeloved, which shows how strangely things come round in this round\r\nworld of ours.\r\n\r\nThe patient reader who has graciously followed my rambling, scrambling\r\nsteps through New Mexico may possibly remember that a large portion of\r\nthe MSS. comprising the archives of the territory, was sold as waste\r\npaper and found way into the various shops of the city. Santa Fé being\r\nthe largest town and commercial center of New Mexico, from it they were\r\nwidely dispersed in every direction, and on this accidental scattering\r\nof leaves hangs my story and a fortune.\r\n\r\nOne night in the Autumn of 1879 I sat boring myself into inanity over\r\nthe _Pharos of the Occident_ (which is a misnomer, the newspaper being\r\nanything but light reading), when a visitor was announced.\r\n\r\n“_Me parece un minero_,” said Dolores Lucia Marina Feliciana Flores.\r\n\r\nI was pleased at the thought of a visitor, even on business, and, in\r\ndread of being left alone with _The Pharos_, insisted _el minero_\r\nshould not be interviewed in the Assay Office, but here. The “Palace”\r\nhalls are neither long nor lofty, being the length of two moderate\r\nrooms on the ground floor, and in a few minutes there stood in the\r\ndeep doorway a figure, as revealed by the shaded student’s lamp,\r\nunmistakably that of a miner. His face was sunburnt to a vermeil red\r\nand made prematurely old by exposure. Wrinkled by drying wind and\r\npitiless sunbeat, his appearance was weather-worn, showing days of\r\nwanderings without shelter and lodgings on the cold, cold ground.\r\n\r\nThe contagion of good manners is a happy thing. In Spanish-speaking\r\ncountries, though all else be lacking, there is ever the most exquisite\r\npoliteness, and the man removed his slouch of a hat with a profound\r\nand sweeping bow. His uncovered head was thatched with a thick shock\r\nof carrot-colored locks, which are the inheritance of “the sandy\r\ncomplected,” to speak after the manner of the poke-berry districts of\r\nour own Indiana. The strip of forehead shaded by his hat was dotted\r\nwith large, assertive freckles, which in the exposed portion of his\r\nface were “in one red burial blent.” He closed the door carefully and,\r\nwith an air of secrecy, dropped his voice to a certain loud whisper,\r\npeculiar to sick-rooms and miners in confidence, and his whisper\r\ngradually sank to the ledger lines below, as he made his report; for,\r\nthough rather untimely, his call was not unexpected.\r\n\r\nI spread _The Pharos_ on my table, and he slowly proceeded to unload\r\nhis pockets and his red handkerchief, and empty on the paper various\r\nores, kept separate, tied in rags and marked. To him they represented\r\nall precious things, besides gold and silver; to me they appeared\r\nformless, jagged lumps of dull-looking stone.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Argonaut was long--too long for any but a\r\nfrontiersman, with plenty of leisure to speak and to hear--and was\r\ngiven in the style of oratory perfected by the Cousin of Sally Dillard.\r\n\r\nHe could not sit still, but started every few minutes, as at a calling\r\nvoice, and strode hurriedly up and down the room, restless, eager,\r\nnervous, like one who, after long and exhaustive strain, suddenly\r\nslackens the tension. With the utmost minuteness he gave the history\r\nand described the locality of each particular sample, and tied them\r\nagain, one by one, each in its own grimy cloth and label. This done,\r\nhe hesitated, cleared his throat, rose from his chair, apologized for\r\ntrespassing upon our valuable time (as though we had anything _but_\r\ntime), opened the door, looked up and down the hall, as if he feared\r\nsome ear was airing at the key-hole. Satisfied with the reconnaissance,\r\nhe closed it again and with stealthy step returned to the table.\r\nEvidently two hours of rigmarole had failed to free his soul. There\r\nwas something still unsaid. We silently awaited the revelation. “There\r\nis one specimen left,” he began, doubtfully, and looked at me much as\r\nto say: Can a woman keep or be trusted with a secret? Perhaps he read\r\nassurance in my face, for he fumbled in his vest (from the Semitic shop\r\nhard by, painfully new and pathetically cheap), and out of its deepest\r\ncorner produced a little bag of buckskin, tied with a leather string.\r\nHe untied it with nervous haste, and his wistful light blue eyes,\r\nburned in deep hollows with miner’s fever, brightened as he spoke,\r\nscarcely above his breath, in an awe-inspiring whisper: “Here we air.\r\nHere’s the richest thing yet.” Shaking the bag, there dropped into the\r\npalm of his left hand a reddish purple stone, without streakings or\r\nglitter. “Ruby silver,” he said, softly. “Ruby silver, and plenty of\r\nit. There’s no end to the lead.”\r\n\r\nHe reached it to me tenderly, as though it could break at a touch.\r\nI did as was expected of me--scraped the fragment of mineral with a\r\npen-knife, peered at it through the magnifying glass, hefted it on\r\nmy forefinger, and made the sagacious observation: “It looks well. I\r\nshould say a very rich specimen.”\r\n\r\n“It’s from the Cañon de los Angelos,” said the miner.\r\n\r\nI remembered it as a dismal gorge, torn up and riddled by volcanic\r\naction, a blasted wilderness of gashed and riven stone peaks, bearing\r\naloft gnarled and twisted firs, their utmost summits a region of ice,\r\nlifted above the limit of life. The silence unbroken but by the howl\r\nof wild beasts and the war-whoop of the savage; where only fresh\r\nmountain-heaps of piled-up lavas, marking the throes of the earthquake,\r\nvary the forbidding gloom which baffles the traveler, entering it\r\nwith a sense of approaching the Valley of the Shadow of Death. As soon\r\nexpect water in desert-sand as gold in that lava-flood, silver in those\r\nmelted rocks!\r\n\r\n“How did you come to prospect in that dreadful cañon?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“The strangest thing in the world,” said the miner, “how I first\r\nlighted on it. I bought a plug of tobacco (it was six years ago), and\r\ncarried it home in a piece of an old letter, dated sixteen hundred and\r\nsomething. I disremember the year. It was writ on thick yellow paper,\r\nto one of the Spanish governors, when Arizona and New Mexico was one.\r\nMy wife was a-studyin’ Spanish (you can’t git along here without some),\r\nand she brought the dictionary to bear and spelt the thing out. It told\r\nabout a rich lead in the Cañon de los Angelos; but the paper was tore\r\noff in the very place I most wanted, so I couldn’t exactly spot it.\r\nFor nigh onto five years I’ve prospected. I’ve hunted off and on, in\r\nhot and cold, wet and dry. I’ve been hungry and thirsty. I’ve scorched\r\nand I’ve froze. Oncet I was nearly drowned by a sudden rise at night,\r\nwhen I camped in an _arroya_. One winter I was snow-blind. Many and\r\nmany’s the week I’ve heard no voice, nothing but the yelp of the coyote\r\nand the wind among the pines. Many and many a time I’ve smelt the\r\ngrizzlies; but, as luck would have it, I never run onto one. A lion or\r\na panther will run when he’s hurt and roar; but a grizzly doesn’t, and,\r\nafter bein’ hit, shot through the heart, instead of dyin’, he lives\r\nlong enough to chaw up the hunter.”\r\n\r\nDear reader, beware of starting the Rocky Mountaineer on bear stories.\r\nYou will feel the daisies growing over you before he slackens the\r\nstrain of his eloquence.\r\n\r\n“Did you spend all these six years in the Cañon?” I inquired, by way of\r\nbringing the prospector back to the subject in hand.\r\n\r\n“Oh! no. By spells I went at other bizness; but the idee of a fortune\r\na-waitin’ for me in Los Angelos, and that old Spanish letter made me\r\nsour on everything. You know it is in Valencia County.”\r\n\r\nI did not, but made an amiable effort to look as though I did.\r\n\r\n“There’s curious old things down there in them old lava-beds.”\r\n\r\n“What things?” I asked, for the first time rousing to any interest, for\r\nmy antiquarian blood began to stir.\r\n\r\n“Heaps of ruins, cities, ragged walls, sixty feet high and ten feet\r\nthick, scattered over miles and miles. The rafters air charred with the\r\nbanked-up fire of the volcano; but I see one beam as sound as the day\r\nit was laid up.”\r\n\r\n“And how did the timber appear?”\r\n\r\n“’Twas piñon, squared with a stone hatchet or hammer and covered with\r\nmarkings--Indian signs, maybe--furrowed with a stone gouge. Then there\r\nwas a drawin’ of the sun, and a sort of a _neye_; the lava had buried\r\ndeep, and people who like old potteries can get a wagon-load there.\r\nAbout four feet down I struck a room, about ten feet square, where\r\nthere was a big fireplace; and in it was a crane, with a clay hook,\r\nand on the end of the hook was a bone. By the side of the fire was a\r\nskeleton--the old man a-watchin’ his bone a-roastin’ on the hook, when\r\nhere comes the lava and seals him up tight. Over yonder, at the Fonda,\r\nI’ve got his skull; and here” (he opened the revolver-pocket this\r\ntime)--“here’s the old fellow’s finger-bone. I’ve lots of the same old\r\narrowheads and a flint tomahawk.”\r\n\r\nI was greatly interested in the still relics of remote generations; but\r\nwe had not reached the mine, and the evening was far spent. “These were\r\nnear your ruby silver mine?” I said, suggestively.\r\n\r\n“Oh! no. As I was sayin’, I found the bones of a dog close to a spring\r\nof sweet water, and I knowed then I was a-gettin’ warm. My time was\r\npretty nigh out. The snow was so deep I hid my tools, and give up for\r\nthe winter and hired out to the freighters. As soon as winter broke I\r\nlit out one moonshiny night. Somehow the prospectors in Santa Fé got\r\nwind of my moves. I don’t know how, unless I told in my sleep, for I\r\nkept dumb as the dead, and I was afeered they’d track me. I hunted\r\nround that Spring in a ring of five miles. First, I found the _acequia_\r\nwhich kept the buried city in water. I followed it in a blind lead\r\nfor three-quarters of a mile, to a broken dam. The trail to the dam\r\ncame next. When I tell you cedars thick as my body air growin’ on that\r\ntrail, you have an idee how long it’s been since tracks has been made\r\nin it.”\r\n\r\nJust there I think the prospector drew on his imagination for his\r\nfacts; but his audience held their peace, and he continued:\r\n\r\n“It was a mighty poor zigzag; but it led to smelters.”\r\n\r\n“To smelters!” we both exclaimed, in a breath; then followed a\r\nthrilling pause. The prospector had reached his climax, and he walked\r\nup and down the floor excitedly, tossing the ruby silver back and forth\r\nin his hands, like the hands of Esau.\r\n\r\n“To old smelters!” he repeated, with emphasis. He struck the\r\nColossus-of-Rhodes pose on the wolf-skin rug and continued:\r\n\r\n“They was made of adobes, and was raised some twenty foot above the\r\nground, and had saw hard service. I prowled around there a full month,\r\nhackin’ and diggin’ alone; for I dassent tell anybody but a Pueblo\r\nIndian, and threatened to kill him if he ever made sign to white man.\r\nIt was my last throw. I was hard up. My old pard was dead, give out\r\nwith rheumatism. My wife had went back to the States. My credit (never\r\nanything to brag on) went after my wife” (he smiled, for the first\r\ntime), “and I see plain luck must come soon or never; but I never\r\nlost my grip. I knowed I was a-gittin’ warm. There’s no sign like the\r\nburied towns. It’s certain indication of diggin’s not far off. It’s\r\nthe rule all over the territories. I lived on venison, venison, till\r\nit was worse than old mutton. About three mile away was a lake, where\r\nI scooped up salt with my hands; but venison and salt gets monotonous\r\nweek in and week out. There was plenty of charcoal (had been used by\r\nthe miners, whoever they was), and I made out that the dam led the\r\nwater of the Abo to the works. From the old furnaces I found another\r\novergrown trail, that run to this mine.”\r\n\r\n“What sort of mine is it?”\r\n\r\n“One of the covered-up ones. It’s certain hundreds of years old, buried\r\nunder felled timber. Some of it had rooted. I was a month gettin’\r\nthrough, and it took a sharp eye to sight it.” The speaker modestly\r\nblinked the milky orbs under their pink lashes, and continued: “The\r\nshaft is eighty feet deep or more, walled up with pine, and drifts\r\nrunnin’ to the right and left a hundred feet or so. I’ve set my stakes\r\nand the papers is all made out. It’s mine, and no divide, and not a\r\nsoul on earth knows about it except you two and me.”\r\n\r\nI have seen so many ruined prospectors hunting mines that are nothing\r\nbut myths, it was cheering to learn there could be no mistake about\r\nthis discovery.\r\n\r\n“You have fairly earned all you have found,” I said, in sympathy.\r\n\r\n“_Gracias, Señora_,” said the rich man, dramatically waving the Esau\r\nhand, evidently enjoying his Spanish.\r\n\r\n“You see this specimen will run twelve hundred to the ton, and there’s\r\nno end to the lead.” He teetered the stone on his trembling forefinger.\r\n“I’ve had a hard time! My wife never got done mournin’ she ever spelt\r\nout the old letter. She’ll feel better now. I’ve struck it, and I guess\r\nI’ve struck it rich.”\r\n\r\nAnd he had. With a farewell toss up of the ruby silver specimen, till\r\nit struck the muslin ceiling overhead, the fortunate man, haggard and\r\nshaken, yet hilarious, took his leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII. THE RUBY SILVER MINE.--(_Continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\nSix months later, in the shade of a light umbrella, I sauntered along\r\nthe beach at Cape May. Down by the summer sea, where lovers walk with\r\nlingering step, rapt, heedless as the dead, of aught but tender glances\r\nand soft words whispered under the sound of the surf. After the desert\r\nsilence and parching dryness of the territories, it was a deep pleasure\r\nto breathe once more the salt, moist air, to hear the mighty monotone,\r\nand watch the restless play of light and color on breakers rolling in\r\nfrom the far Bermudas, beating against the shore like the tireless\r\nheart of earth.\r\n\r\nThinking upon nothing but simple enjoyment of earth, sea, and sky,\r\nI strolled in quiet sympathy with the unknown crowd, when suddenly\r\nan open carriage, drawn by two horses, stopped near us. It was light\r\nas a wicker toy, the airiest, fairiest thing manufactured since the\r\nnight Cinderella rode to the ball. So slight in construction one might\r\nthink it would scarcely bear the weight of one person, had we not seen\r\nthat every portion was perfectly wrought. The tempered steel and light\r\nwheels would endure a severe strain. Ornate as burnish could make it,\r\ngilding and varnish sparkled in the sunlight, gay rosette and flying\r\nribbon were not lacking. Instead of cloth, the lining was plaited\r\nviolet satin, of exquisite tint. I have never seen so elegant a turnout\r\nelsewhere. The cushions were fit for an empress, laces and velvets to\r\ntrail on, a seat where a king might rest and keep the soil from the\r\nermine and velvet of his coronation robe.\r\n\r\nThe small horses seemed made for the fairy carriage. They were\r\ncoal-black, perfectly matched, without a white hair on them. Your\r\ncorrespondent knows precious little about horses, except one ancient\r\npony, which lost an eye in a pre-historic raid on a corn-crib; but\r\nignorance itself could see these were of no common blood. The broad\r\nfaces and delicate ears, the luminous eyes, soft as an antelope’s, the\r\narching necks, veiled with silken manes like the fluffy hair of young\r\ngirls, come of no menial race, such as haul drays and drop on pavements\r\nin the streets. The mettlesome, high-bred beauties, pawing impatiently\r\nwith hoofs like polished ebony, were such steeds as dash through\r\nthe Ouida novels or come home at the masters’ call under the black\r\ntents, the Arab houses of hair. We had started for the light-house,\r\nthree miles away, and in the dazzle of all that luxury and ease the\r\nbrightness went out of the day. My walk suddenly became hard and long.\r\nIt required the entire skill and strength of the liveried driver to\r\nmanage the reins, while the occupant within leaped nimbly out to adjust\r\nsome portion of the harness. He was dressed in garments of finest\r\nfabric and freshest cut, in which the tailor had missed the easy fit\r\nso coveted by gentlemen. A Pactolian watch-chain streamed across his\r\nbreast, and lightish gloves on massive hands gave the wearer the aspect\r\nof being pretty much all gloves. A host of idlers gathered in a moment,\r\nand, with them, I stopped to admire the equipage, perfect in make and\r\nornament, costly as money can buy, and then and there broke the tenth\r\ncommandment.\r\n\r\nEvidently the envied man felt fussy and grew fidgety under all those\r\nstaring eyes. I rubbed mine (not so young as they once were), to clear\r\na confused, bewildering recollection. Could it be? No! impossible!\r\nTo reassure myself, I looked toward the sea, then back again to the\r\nsky, the town. It was no spirit of earth or air, no cheat of vision or\r\nbrain. The territorial sunburn had faded from his face, but lingered in\r\nthe scorched carrot hair, and Rocky Mountain wrinkles are not easily\r\nironed out. Well I knew those early crow’s feet at the corners of the\r\nmilky blue orbs. The owner of the princely establishment, with its\r\nrare belongings, was none other than our frontier friend, once sole\r\nproprietor of the Dives Mine, in the Cañon de los Angelos, which sold\r\nfor eighteen hundred thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThe golden key opens many doors; but it takes time and some skill\r\nto fit it into the lock. The lavender kids split as the Dives miner\r\nhastily jerked them off, to fasten a harness-buckle; the flash of a\r\nsuperb diamond ring followed the movement. He threw the delicately\r\ntinted gloves on the ground, with words more emphatic than correct,\r\nmuttered under a scant fringe of pink moustache, then turned a\r\ndeprecating, apologetic glance toward the crowd.\r\n\r\nAn instant the ancient prospector held me with his glittering eye. It\r\nsaid, plainly as whisper in my ear: I beg you do not tell on me.\r\n\r\nI did not. He hurried back to his place. The Esau hand, with its\r\nblazing diamond, closed the door with a heavy slam. It did not hold.\r\nHe banged it again, and yet once more, growing very red in the face,\r\nbefore he could lean away from our gaze back on the violet cushions.\r\nFrom that soft recess he called loudly to the driver to “git.” There\r\nwere a few significant nods as the night-black steeds sped with swift\r\ngrace over the wet beach, but nothing was said except by a very\r\ncharming young lady, fresh from Ollendorf. She released a loving arm\r\nto bend forward a moment and wave her fine little handkerchief at the\r\nvanishing show, exclaiming: “_Adieu, monsieur le nouveau riche._”\r\n\r\nThe sweet girl graduate had taken the sense of the meeting. When the\r\npurple and gold passed from sight, the throng fell into line as before\r\nthe interruption, and in placid enjoyment yielded to the dreamy spell\r\nof vesper sunlight and lulling sound. All was refined, serene, restful.\r\n\r\nThe mild ripples, changeful as the hues of the dolphin, came and went,\r\nleaving their slight tracery in the sand, secret messages from hidden\r\ndepths far away. The blue waters murmured mystic music to fair and\r\ngracious maidens and youths of gentle, graceful mien; tender cushats,\r\ncooing and wooing and sighing, but not for the touch of vanished hands.\r\nThe rhythmic ebb and flow charmed the sense with hints of warbling\r\nperis and dying cadences of mermaids’ songs. Earth and ocean in perfect\r\ntune, the very air thrilled with a tremulous harmony, while youth and\r\nbeauty wove their low, sweet idyl. Lapwings glided along the sands,\r\nwhere the sick lady rested in her invalid chair, under a gayly-striped\r\nawning. White gulls screamed and circled round a ship lying at anchor\r\nin the shining bay, her flag a wavy line of brilliant color against\r\nthe pale horizon. Beyond it, in dim perspective, a long procession of\r\nvessels slowly sailing. An endless picture, suggestive of famous places\r\nand unknown nations, gathered treasure of pearl and amber, spicery and\r\nsilks, and happy home, coming from voyages through halcyon seas, by\r\ndistant fragrant shores. The wind was warm, its breath was balm, the\r\nworld was lulled to rest.\r\n\r\nA flush of pink fell from out the tranquil sky. It dropped fresh roses\r\non faded cheeks, and in its blush I saw the young face beside me as it\r\nhad been the face of an angel. Then I thought the beautiful is wealth,\r\nthe world over. My darling holds in her slender hand the keys of the\r\npalaces.\r\n\r\nThe walk to the light-house was not so bad, after all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Zuñi Effigies.]\r\n\r\nMy holiday ended, I returned to the City of Holy Faith, and exactly a\r\nyear from the date of this story took my constitutional walk in the\r\nsplendor of sunlight such as never falls on land or sea east of the\r\nRocky Mountains. No fear of rain to drive me indoors, no speculations\r\nabout clear or cloudy to-morrows, we know a radiant shining will\r\nlighten the coming morning, just as it filled the sky of yesterday.\r\nWith the Pueblos, I am a devout sun-worshipper and love at his rising\r\nto salute the lord of light and life, and again “under the sad passion\r\nof the dying day” to watch his departure. Returning from my invisible\r\naltar on old Fort Marcy, I threaded my way through cramped and\r\ncrooked streets, and, making the round of the Plaza, saw beside the\r\ngate a _burro_ being loaded with a miner’s outfit. He was not much\r\nlarger than a dog; beyond compare the most wretched of his miserable\r\nrace, a pitiable wreck. He was mangy and sore-eyed, his tail tapered\r\nto a stumpy point, the tuft at the end fallen beyond the reach of any\r\n“restorer.” Patches of hair worn off in various portions of his body\r\nexposed wrinkled, leathery hide, and the dark cross over the shoulders\r\nwas pitted with scars, like marks of small-pox. There was not enough\r\nflesh on those protrusive bones to make one meal for the ravening\r\nmountain wolf, or a respectable lunch for half a dozen carrion crows.\r\nArid and dusty, the creature looked like the mummy of some antediluvian\r\nanimal. Easy to see his portion had been kicks, scourge, goads, abuse;\r\nno champagne savannah, no green meadow or lush blue grass in his line\r\nof travel; but life-withering marches in snowy and sandy desert, where\r\nscant herbage and meagre shrub were enough for the starving slave.\r\n\r\nYet the sorry beast was not senseless nor altogether broken in spirit.\r\nA train of mules went by. Among them he recognized an old acquaintance,\r\na fellow-sufferer. He lifted his head and plucked up heart for a\r\npassing salute, essaying a feeble bray. The unwonted sound was too\r\ngreat an effort for the gaunt throat. It died in a hoarse rattle and\r\nwas buried in a succession of notes, the strangest mortal ear has heard\r\nsince that old day Jubal first struck the gamut.\r\n\r\nPick, shovel, bags of crackers, blanket, and coffee-pot were piled high\r\non the tough burden-bearer, and, watching the loading done by a Mexican\r\nboy, a tall man lazily leaned against the diminutive brute, apparently\r\nreckless of the danger of upsetting donkey and cargo, and sending them\r\nsprawling across the sidewalk. There was nothing to draw attention in\r\nhis familiar uniform--high-top boots, cactus-proof buckskin pants,\r\nhickory shirt, red neck-handkerchief; but under the broad slouch hat\r\nwere straggling locks that caught my eye--a peculiar tinge of reddish\r\nbronze, the _cabello del oro_ of the Argonaut of ’79.\r\n\r\nThe never-resting wheel of fortune had made the downward curve. The\r\nDives miner had summered in Saratoga, betting on cards and horses,\r\nhad staked tens of thousands on the hazard of a dicer’s throw, lost\r\neverything, and now was back to the starting-place, ready to try again.\r\nI remembered the purple and gold, the dash and glitter of the rich man\r\nat Cape May. The apparition of prancing steeds of matchless beauty,\r\nwith dainty limbs, too dainty for the sand they touched but to spurn,\r\nflitted before me.\r\n\r\nGambler though he was and deserved it, the forlornness of the change\r\nwould touch a harder heart than yours or mine, dear reader. I stepped\r\ntoward the gate. At that moment Dives--perhaps I had best say\r\nLazarus--poked the poor _burro_ with a sharp stick and, in a high, gay\r\nvoice, struck up:\r\n\r\n  “Of all the wives you e’er can know,\r\n   There’s none like Nancy Lee, I trow.”\r\n\r\nThen, as Bunyan hath it, he went on his way and I saw him no more.\r\n\r\nThis story sounds like a pure invention. Does it not? I confess to\r\ntrifling attempts in decorative art, a tiny dash of color, the least\r\nbit of embroidery, just to round a corner and give a little life to\r\ndullness, you know, but not now. My hero is to-day a day-laborer,\r\nworking in the great King Henry lead in the Shakespeare district of\r\nNew Mexico--the man who for one brief summer reckoned his money by\r\nhundreds of thousands. You can see him when you go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII. MINE EXPERIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader who graciously follows me to the end of this brief history\r\nwill readily comprehend why it must be somewhat obscure. “I could a\r\ntale unfold” better worth the hearing, but like the poor ghost I am\r\nforbid to tell the secrets of my prison house. It need harrow up no\r\nsoul to hint that the scene was laid and drama played not a thousand\r\nmiles from Tucson, Arizona.\r\n\r\nImagine a _vega_ of sea-like vastness, in a rock-setting of ghostly\r\nSierras whose rent crags pierce through the rich blue air far above the\r\nsnow line. In the primeval years the Apaches possessed the country, and\r\nwith the poetic instinct which never quite forsakes the savagest of\r\nsavages they called this range the Mist-Befringed Mountains. To reach\r\nthe valley from the west, we leave the main road and cross rough masses\r\nof lava which block the way. The seeming barrier ends in a narrow pass,\r\na mile or so from wall to wall,--a mighty stone corridor stately as\r\nKarnak, and gloomy with the all-pervading silence of death. At the end\r\nis a high natural gateway of red granite; passing under it we emerge\r\ninto a smooth expanse level as water, an amphitheatre whose blank\r\nsurface is relieved by scattered masses of lava upheaved in some fiery\r\nearthquake long stilled their rigid outlines jagged and bristling.\r\n\r\nThere is no verdure to soften the foothills so savagely hacked and\r\nsplit in yawning cracks. No tender moss, no shrub, no sparkling water\r\nor waving branches brighten the leaden hues of the gray desert;\r\ntreeless, windless, waterless. If herbage ever grew there it is now\r\noverdrifted with sand. The wonderful mirage--most marvelous of Nature’s\r\nmysteries--swims over it in the dreamy haze of early morning. A deep,\r\ndark coolness follows the burning day, and the jeweled sky, of opal and\r\nturquoise, is unspeakably beautiful. Other change there is none.\r\n\r\nIt would seem a place for the unclean condor to lay her eggs on the\r\nbare rocks, and the eagle to wheel and scream and stir up her nest with\r\nwings which battle the storm; but there is no trace of bird or insect\r\nlife, no wolf or antelope, coyote or lizard.\r\n\r\nIt is the one place in which I have stood where the earth is as still\r\nas the sky. Suppose we call the dreary region with its adamantine rocks\r\nthe Foothills of the Mountains of the Moon. There in the beginning\r\nsilence set her seal, unbroken till eighteen hundred and--some odd\r\nyears. For reasons obvious, I cannot be exact regarding dates.\r\n\r\nIn a memorable hour the death-like hush was startled by the ring of a\r\nsingle hammer on the torn mountain wall at the west end of the _vega_.\r\nBlow on blow against the riven clefts resounded through the warm blue\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nWas it a Bostonian seeking the Infinite? Did he see beyond the verge of\r\nsight, like the young Aladdin led on by the Genii of the Cave?\r\n\r\nAll day the one man toiled, digging, hewing, breaking, scraping pieces\r\nof stone with a pen-knife. What he sought he evidently found, put some\r\nof it in his pockets, other portions in his haversack, and wound out of\r\nthe cavernous gloom at sunset through the narrow defile to the world\r\noutside the lifeless plain. He is brave beyond the bravest who would\r\nstay there till midnight,\r\n\r\n  “Alone in the terrible waste with God.”\r\n\r\nA week passed, and one crisp and clear morning--owing to very high\r\naltitude the nights here are always cool--three men passed under the\r\nrock gateway, each with tools and determination of iron. Steadily they\r\nworked in the long hot day, stopping for lunch and a short rest at\r\nnoon. Only the all seeing eye was upon them, no human ear was there\r\nto hear, yet at intervals they looked around as though in an enemy’s\r\ncountry, and their rare speech was in suppressed voices. They bent with\r\nfaces to the ground as children hunt for nuts. They peered into cracks\r\nand crevices and pried up loose stones, scattered _débris_, broke them\r\nopen, and gazed at their interior under a hand mirror. Occasionally\r\nthe lightest man, a mere stripling, mounted the shoulders of the other\r\ntwo and seized something above their heads. Were they a trio of poets\r\nobeying the charge of the Bard of the Sierras, “Lean your ladder not\r\nagainst the clouds, but against the solid Rocky Mountains and climb\r\nthere?” They saw something which thrilled their pulses, and bore off a\r\nload in sacks just as the snow crowned peaks blushed with the ineffable\r\nbeauty of the afterglow. Then darkness leaped from the mountain walls\r\nand held the valley, in the starry silence, lone as the land Havillah\r\nbefore the first gold seekers crossed the river on their endless quest.\r\n\r\nAnother week brought a picnic party largely composed of ladies, two\r\ngentlemen in army blue, girls made of roses and dimples, curls and\r\nribbons, young men with eager, handsome faces. Rocky Mountain ladies\r\nare always well mounted and are fearless horsewomen. Diana Vernon might\r\nenvy their dash and daring, and in this rarified atmosphere horses are\r\nmettlesome and endure as they cannot in the low countries. There was\r\nmuch prancing and spurring through the rugged defile, and many a rider\r\nless bold would have been unseated even on the sure-footed ponies. They\r\nbrought little twigs of _pinones_ from the _cañons_ and made fires\r\nwith matches scraped on boot heels; they unpacked hampers, opened\r\ncans, played games, shouted, sung, wild with overflowing spirits; they\r\nate, drank and were merry, all the while hunting and hunting. Lovers\r\nstrayed in pairs to dusky recesses in the mountain rim, not on purpose\r\nto be lost nor to find the four-leaf clover, nor yet to learn how to\r\nmake love dials of daisies. They sought something more than the hasty\r\ncharm of a stolen kiss. They looked for shining stones, gleaming metal,\r\nprecious clay, and every one carried in a pocket handkerchief minute\r\nsections of the adamantine Foothills of the Mountains of the Moon.\r\nEven uninstructed eyes can trace the rust colored, red-brown lines of\r\n“blossom rock,” and it is following a captivating lead to yield one’s\r\nself to its beguiling ways.\r\n\r\nOne youth and maiden tracked it far up the _cañon_ to a gnarled and\r\ntwisted pine which overhung the edge of a sheer crag to which it clung\r\nby roots clutching like claws. In the dry, dewless air the needles\r\nof the pine lay in soft carpeting undisturbed for ages. They sat and\r\nrested beneath the skeleton tree, and listened to soft æolian airs\r\nfaintly stirring the bare branches overhead. Then she sang in the\r\nsweetest voice:\r\n\r\n  “Is this a dream? Then waking would be pain.”\r\n\r\nAnd in answer he tossed up his cap and it lodged in the pine, and they\r\nclapped their hands in an impromptu chorus, “No, no, no! a thousand\r\ntimes, no!” If there be elves in the Mist-Befringed Mountains they\r\nmust have laughed at this frolicsome glee, for such sounds are a new\r\nrevelation there. The young couple were not crazy, they had heaved up a\r\nrough brown stone, and striking it with a heavy hammer they saw--_ay de\r\nmi!_ the electric flash of wedding rings. The zigzag lines of “blossom\r\nrock” held wreaths of orange flowers, hitherto unattainable, and now\r\nthey felt so near their sweetness they were filled with delight. The\r\npoor young things had thought best to bear their poverty apart (he was\r\na second lieutenant), but now they could hear marriage bells in every\r\nstroke of the magic hammer, in every throb of their happy hearts.\r\n\r\nA stray dove, bewildered and lost, lighted at their feet, tame because\r\nignorant of men, and they hailed the gentle bird as an omen. Then\r\nhe called her his dove-eyed darling, talking the sweet foolery my\r\ngray-haired reader laughs at, but would give a year of peaceful life to\r\nhear again for one half-hour.\r\n\r\nO day of bridal brightness whose splendor lives in the illuminated Book\r\nof Chronicles!--let me linger a moment over its unfading beauty. The\r\nlovers locked their happy arms together and trod lightly over enchanted\r\nground, in the silence of perfect happiness,--all that is left us of\r\nthe lost language of Eden. Wherever their sparkling glances fell,\r\nmyrtles sprung up. O never, on land, or in sea, grew flowers like those\r\nwhich bloomed in their foot-prints along the sandy beds of “blossom\r\nrock.”\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant was bare-headed, for he never got his cap, though he\r\nstoned it valiantly and even shot his revolver at the limb where it\r\nhung. A frontier lady is full of expedients as Robinson Crusoe, and\r\nthe girl he loved, with deft and tasteful fingers devised a cap from\r\nher silken kerchief and trimmed it with a drooping feather from her\r\nown riding hat. Very proud was the face beneath it, and he bowed in\r\nadmiration of her ingenuity and murmured some soft nonsense you do not\r\ncare to hear.\r\n\r\nThey joined the party in the plain with an assumption of indifference,\r\ntransparent as mica,--a flimsy ruse, old as the oldest lovers,--and of\r\ncourse every one saw just how matters stood the instant they appeared.\r\nHe went to look after the pony, tied by a _lariat_ to a block of stone,\r\npatted her never so gently, stroked her mane, and called her “Pretty\r\ngirl, pretty girl.” The maiden sat on a striped Navayo blanket and in\r\nan arch bewitching way sang to an old Spanish air full of trills and\r\ngraces this song:\r\n\r\n  “QUIEN SABE?”[17]\r\n\r\n  I.\r\n\r\n  “The breeze of the evening that cools the hot air,\r\n  That kisses the orange and shakes out thy hair,\r\n  Is its freshness less welcome, less sweet its perfume,\r\n  That you know not the region from whence it is come?\r\n  Whence the wind blows, where the wind goes,\r\n  Hither, and thither, and whither--who knows? Who knows?\r\n  Hither and thither--but whither--who knows?\r\n\r\n  II.\r\n\r\n  “The river forever glides singing along,\r\n  The rose on the bank bends adown to its song,\r\n  And the flower, as it listens, unconsciously dips\r\n  Till the rising wave glistens and kisses its lips.\r\n  But why the wave rises and kisses the rose,\r\n  And why the rose stops for those kisses--who knows? Who knows?\r\n  And away flows the river--but whither--who knows?\r\n\r\n  III.\r\n\r\n  “Let _me_ be the breeze, love, that wanders along\r\n  The river that ever rejoices in song;\r\n  Be _thou_ to my fancy the orange in bloom,\r\n  The rose by the river that gives its perfume.\r\n  Would the fruit be so golden, so fragrant the rose,\r\n  If no breeze and no wave were to kiss them? Who knows? Who knows?\r\n  If no breeze and no wave were to kiss them? Who knows?”\r\n\r\nBefore the singer lay the desert grim and bare, girdled by scarred,\r\nseamed mountains--a boundary wall touched with purplish tints of\r\nsupreme beauty. Behind her, a dim outline of snow and granite in the\r\nfar horizon, the Sierra Nevada projected against the rainless blue,\r\nthe blade of snow-white teeth which suggested its Castilian name. The\r\nvalley had a fascination from its absolute loneliness. Not a cloud\r\nflecked the blue above, not a breath stirred the air while the song was\r\nsung.\r\n\r\nThe elders gave it a divided attention, being intent on lumps of\r\ntreasure which they “hefted” in their palms, balanced on their\r\nforefingers, and gazed at affectionately through a glass into which\r\nthey puckered their eyelids, making gathers of the crow’s feet quite\r\nfrightful to see. As each one passed the glass to his neighbor he\r\nnodded in dumb approval, with a look of mystery smiling and smiling,\r\nand the more enthusiastic winked and rubbed their hands as it went the\r\nrounds.\r\n\r\nSuch witchcraft is there in one small hand mirror!\r\n\r\nAfter lunch at picnics there is usually a period of “nooning” while\r\ngentlemen smoke and ladies recline, or seek _siestas_ in friendly\r\nshade; but there was no quiet here and to the last no flagging of the\r\nhigh festivity.\r\n\r\nA rose-blush of exquisite haze, a phantasm “mystic, wonderful,”\r\nfloating through the vapory architecture of the Sierras, seemed the\r\nvery soul of the halcyon day. The adorable girl who turned more than\r\none head by smoking cigarettes, waved her hand at the shade and called\r\nloudly, “Look, see, the day is dying, its spirit is passing. Turn your\r\nfaces to the west and be attentive.”\r\n\r\nGaily they hastened to gather round the fair speaker. With low\r\nmutterings and many tragic gestures she drew a circle in the sand,\r\nstood in the centre and blew a whiff of smoke, north, south, east,\r\nwest, as Moqui Indians invoke the sun with their incantations.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said the self-elected priestess, with solemn accent, “now watch\r\nwithout speech or breath, and we will have a token and a sign from the\r\ngod of the Pueblos.”\r\n\r\nHumoring her fancy, they waited in silence and lo! before their eyes\r\nthe shape darkened, glowed, transmuted into a mass of glittering gold.\r\n\r\n“The oracles have answered,” she cried. “Good bye, O Sun, ruler of this\r\nhour, take thanks from thy white children for the golden promise of\r\nto-day. Believers, salute him.”\r\n\r\nAll obeyed, and with bare head and uproarious cheers waved hats and\r\nhandkerchiefs in good bye to the day and the friendly powers that be.\r\nThe merry cavalcade, laughing and shouting, rode straight into the\r\ngolden fire and flaming snow, each one carrying heavy weights of stone,\r\nevery heart beating lightly.\r\n\r\nRapidly the voices died away. The metallic luster of the sky melted\r\ninto opalescent pearl and purple. Day and night kissed and parted.\r\nSuddenly the stars looked out in serene eternal beauty on the\r\nsmouldering fires, the vanishing trace of man, and the _vega_ alone\r\nwith the night,--the hushed desolation doubly drear for the apparition\r\nof loveliness which endured but for a day.\r\n\r\nThe next morning brought more men with picks and hammers, mules laden\r\nwith kegs of water, shovels and various cooking utensils and traps.\r\nThere was a stir and bustle, two tents were pitched; a conspicuous\r\nfigure was a cook “come up from de Souf durin’ de wah,”--sign of a\r\npermanent camp. Against stubborn clay and quartz rock work goes on\r\nslowly, but it did go on in the Mist-Befringed Mountains. It took many\r\nweeks to survey a certain district and make excavations, one deep as\r\na well. They were made against obstacles which daunt men of weak\r\nwill; lack of fuel, lack of water, torrid sun-heat, chill, benumbing\r\nnights. The plain was dotted with holes very like graves, marked with\r\nlittle pine head-boards bearing dates and figures. They have sweet\r\nnames: “Baby Mine,” “Golden Fleece,” “Sleeping Beauty,” “Maud Muller,”\r\n“Highland Mary,” “Daystar,” “The Fair Ophelia.” This last is the\r\ndeepest excavation.\r\n\r\nUsually claim stakes, for such they are, in out-of-the-way places mark\r\nthe “Old Bourbon,” “The Right Bower,” “Dying Gasp,” “Wake up, Jake,”\r\n“New Deal,” “Chance Shot,” “The Blue Pup,” and so on. The titles are\r\nindication of the vein of tender sentiment which runs deep in the heart\r\nof woman. Evidently gentle souls fluttered about the head-boards when\r\nthey were set in the ground. They were standing there to-day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat row of stars, dear reader, means,\r\n\r\n  “Thoughts which do lie too deep for tears.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSometimes in quiet Sunday afternoons a party of lovely women, the\r\ncharmed number not less than the graces nor more than the muses, ride\r\nout from Las Lunas, through the frowning avenue and lonesome gorge, and\r\nhaunt the silent valley as mourners are wont to linger about new-made\r\ngraves. To avoid trouble in remembering names I group them.\r\n\r\nAllow me to present my charming friends the Pleiads. Years, tears, or\r\nstudy, perhaps all combined, have dimmed the brilliance of one face.\r\nThey tread softly and slowly, are very depressed, and appear to find\r\na mourner’s consolation in reading the head-boards. Under the funeral\r\nshadow cast by the overhanging pine (the Lieutenant’s cap is still\r\nthere) they sit on newly spaded earth and compare experience and\r\nsorrows. A dove in the skeleton tree, listening, might hear subdued\r\nlaments: “O why did I touch the ‘Sleeping Beauty?’” “‘Of all the sad\r\nwords of tongue or pen,’” “‘All that glitters is not gold,’” and as\r\nthey bend above the “Highland Mary,” one hums an old song, beginning:\r\n\r\n  “Thou lingering star with lessening ray.”\r\n\r\nSung with tenderness and pathos it floats through the deathlike\r\nstillness like a dirge. Can it be possible these sad-eyed mourners are\r\nthe bright spirits of the picnic, who made that shining day\r\n\r\n         ----“a beauteous dream,\r\n  If it had been no more?”\r\n\r\n’Twere vain to tell thee all.\r\n\r\nJust when it matters not, these women pondered over maps, meaningless\r\nto them as the fifteen puzzle which has proved the streak of idiocy in\r\nthe entire human family; over Miner’s Handbooks, over the “Prospector’s\r\nComplete Guide to Wealth.” They grew familiar with frightful\r\nengravings, flaming pictures of red hot underground machinery, lurid\r\nas the Insurance Chromo. Light literature and the newspapers were\r\nforsaken, and instead their tables were littered with such pamphlets\r\nas “Treatises on the Patent Amalgamator,” “The best method of reducing\r\nArgentiferous Ores,” and “The Hydraulic Ram,”--a horrible subject. The\r\nfeminine mind does not readily adjust itself to this sort of lore, and\r\nthough novel and highly instructive they were forced to confess it was\r\n“trying.” The owner of “The Fair Ophelia” almost lost her reason in a\r\nfrantic and futile effort to master the workings of the diamond drill,\r\nand to comprehend the advantages the double oscillating cylinder engine\r\nhas over the steel or percussive system of drilling.\r\n\r\nWhile these exhaustive studies went on, the students discoursed of\r\nfissure veins, of float, leads, developments, face rock, bed rock,\r\npyrites, chlorides, sulphurets. Alternating anguish and ecstacy shook\r\ntheir slender frames; one day brought a dazzling promise, the next a\r\nblank contradiction which told on their nerves with the force of a\r\nblow. Everything was shifting and uncertain except the assessments.\r\nThere was a sense of security in having one thing to be relied on, and\r\nthey were brought in with exact regularity. The moon did not wax and\r\nwane with more unvarying certainty, and obligations of all sorts were\r\nmet with unquestioning promptness, not to say alacrity.\r\n\r\nHow many months’ pay went into these rich experiences your historian\r\nis unable to record. The Pleiads, though brilliant in the social\r\ncircle, were not trained to strict business habits, and it is\r\npossible, indeed quite probable, no account of expense was kept. In\r\nthat time the battered old pun about lying on your oars (not to be\r\ndespised and able to bear a good deal of abuse yet) was dinned in\r\nears to which the antique witticism was already familiar. The note of\r\nwarning fell lightly as snow falls on snow, leaving no imprint; and\r\nthe toilsome excavating went bravely on. A judicious friend--merely a\r\nlooker-on--advised selling out. The old frontiersman was assailed with\r\nindignant scorn. Much learning had made him mad.\r\n\r\n“What! sell out now, _now_, in the face of such a prospect.”\r\n\r\n“After all this outlay!”\r\n\r\n“After holding on so long! Now!”\r\n\r\n“Not if I know myself.”\r\n\r\n“Nor I.”\r\n\r\n“Nor I.”\r\n\r\n“Nor I.”\r\n\r\nBefore the seven-fold chorus and harpings the dismayed counsellor\r\nhastily retreated to his adobe office, and the Pleiads looked forth as\r\nthe morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an\r\narmy with banners.\r\n\r\nPatient investigation fails to show up (unconsciously one drops into\r\nmining phrase in mining countries) any offer to buy, but the very\r\nthought of selling out was rousing--a reflection on the fair owner of\r\n“The Fair Ophelia.” Varying rapture and despair wore those lovely women\r\nto faded spectres, for the long, slow lesson of waiting is a fearful\r\nstrain on tense nerves. Well for their balance is it that housekeeping\r\nis so difficult on the barren frontier.\r\n\r\nDespite the wholesome restraint of domestic duty, the daily task of\r\nmaking something out of nothing, they wiled away long afternoons\r\ntelling stories worthy the best days of Monte Cristo, Captain Kidd and\r\nthe gallant Sinbad. A childish credulity overtook them. Though highly\r\nintellectual and very superior, educated in modern “culture” (Boston\r\naccent), they showed a capacity for belief that was amazing.\r\n\r\nHow diligently they groped along the tangled lines on the agonizing\r\nmaps! How glibly they talked of metalliferous foothills, of bonanza\r\nkings, of “extracting” and “separating processes,” of running galleries\r\nand driven tunnels. You know it is the amateur who is most sanguine in\r\nevery enterprise. The joint stock of enthusiasm owned by the Pleiads\r\nlightened the way but was not inexhaustible. Notwithstanding enlivening\r\nconverse in learned phrase--a kind of foreign language--hope flickered,\r\nthe fever burned their eyes into hollows, and the judicious friend\r\nshook his white head in secret, forecasting how long this sort of thing\r\nwas going to last.\r\n\r\nWhen the crisis came Electra fainted dead away,--dropped as if shot\r\nthrough the heart. She was a good deal reduced with study of secrets\r\nhid in “The Smelter,” and the book slipped from her nerveless hand as\r\nshe reached out to receive the dispatch.\r\n\r\nIt came at the close of the short twilight of a day never to be\r\nforgotten. She was sitting in the _portal_ to catch the last rays on\r\nthe printed page, for her eyes are not so young as they once were,\r\nand in this land there is brief margin time of silver gray sky and\r\ndrowsing earth. There trotted along the sheep paths and through the\r\ncramped and crooked streets a _burro_ with all the speed a _burro_\r\ncan make, goaded forward by a stick sharpened to that end. Mounted on\r\nhim without bridle, saddle, whip or spur, was a boy recognized as a\r\nsort of messenger in the camp of the Mist-Befringed Mountains,--a boy\r\nbeautiful as a princess’ page, with real Murillo head and luminous\r\noriental eyes beaming with steady light in the olive face. There was\r\nexceptional grace in the movement of his limbs as he dismounted; his\r\nvoice is always sad, and the soft “_Buenos dias Señora_,” conveyed no\r\nhint whether the bearer brought tidings good or ill. Bareheaded, he yet\r\ncontrived to make the courtly Spanish bow, shook back his jetty locks,\r\nand bending low delivered the letter. The boy’s lovely name is Rafael\r\nAntonina Molino, and the dispatch was a leaf torn from a scratch-book,\r\nscrawled in haste with a hand that evidently trembled in the writing.\r\nIt ran:\r\n\r\n  Near Las Lunas.\r\n\r\n  At last! About noon yesterday the digger in “The Fair Ophelia” struck\r\n  soft carbonates genuine Leadville carbonates, and are now down four\r\n  feet. They show up better and better.\r\n\r\n  Your own Jason.\r\n\r\n  P. S.--Send me a white shirt. I am to speak at the ratification\r\n  meeting to-night.\r\n\r\nA thrilling pause--a scream, a bursting shower of tears, kisses,\r\nembraces, a confusion of tongues in which the word “carbonate” was\r\nthe only one common to all. Such a sunshiny storm is possible only to\r\nnervous women intensely wrought. In the _Mêlée_ a natty little jacket,\r\nbrought by mail from Altman’s and almost as good as new, was absolutely\r\nripped to pieces. When mines are _en bonanza_ (free translation,\r\n“booming”) who cares for New York jackets?\r\n\r\nI shrink from the attempt to picture what Carlyle might call the\r\nresplendent weeks which followed, while a test ton of ore was sent\r\nto Silver City for reduction. Still less can I venture to touch the\r\nforlorn portrait of the judicious friend who advised selling out. He\r\nrepented in sack cloth and alkali dust, and meekly apologized three\r\ntimes a day and again at bed time. So vanquished, he kept close in\r\nhis earth works and hardly took courage to share the general joy.\r\nThey are living yet who believe there was a dash of sarcasm in the\r\nwithered smile with which he modestly used to inquire after the wealth\r\nof Denmark’s daughter. Through the resplendent weeks (I love that\r\nexquisite word) the spectres scarcely lost sight of each other, and\r\nthey were very pallid. They mooned about like young lovers in a trance,\r\nand like them saw with eyes anointed. A glory rested on our dull earth,\r\ntinging it with rose-bloom and amethyst, as the wintry moon, looking\r\nthrough pictured windows, warmed the snowy breast of Madeline, utterly\r\n_tête montée_, a riotous prodigality possessed them. Their bank account\r\nwas a sight to see, and under the sweet influence of the Pleiads the\r\npoor rejoiced and beggars thrived.\r\n\r\nIn happy nights, too sweet for sleep, they gathered lilies of Damascus\r\nand drank from springs shaded by plumy palms of Judea. They painted\r\nbirds, long legged birds on panels, and sets of china containing a\r\nthousand pieces each. Ever they whispered, murmured, dreamed. Soon as\r\nthe delirium passed and the fever cooled they resolved to flee “the\r\nfinest climate in the world,” beloved of reporters, which every one\r\nrushes away from as soon as he has the money to go.\r\n\r\nTake care! Take care! These are the shores of doom. Among other curious\r\nformations in the adamantine Foothills of the Mountains of the Moon\r\nare the Lodestone Rocks. Swiftly, swiftly, the ship was drawn to them.\r\nThe gilded argosy with its precious freightage, swelling sail and\r\ntriumphant banner went to pieces. Rosebloom and violet faded into the\r\nlight of common day. The poor headboards beside the open graves are the\r\nlast of the wreck, marking the spot where hopes rose so brightly they\r\nappeared sure prophesies unrolled.\r\n\r\n[Dear reader, on whom I lean in tender confidence, forgive this secret\r\ntear over the lifeless clay of “The Fair Ophelia.” I sat by its cradle,\r\nI followed its hearse.]\r\n\r\nThe judicious friend ventures abroad now. He smiles shrewdly and the\r\nmourners dream no more. They see with cleared vision, and will take one\r\nof the many roads which lead to the Golden Milestone, and their dreams\r\nwill all come true when galena sells for a dollar an ounce.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[17] I need hardly tell my reader the words “_Quien Sabe?_”--“Who\r\nknows?”--are the unanswerable answer forever on the Spanish-speaking\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV. THE RUINS OF MONTEZUMA’S PALACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo American antiquities except, perhaps, the Old Mill at Newport, have\r\nfigured so largely in imagination and in print as the pre-historic\r\nruins along the Gila River, in Pinal County, Arizona. More than\r\nthirty years ago antiquarian hearts were deeply stirred by accounts\r\nof travellers, then very rare, describing the Casas Grandes as great\r\ncities of hewn stone built in a rich and noble architecture like that\r\nof Egypt. Rhetorical flourishes and bold flights of fancy, colored\r\nthe pictures drawn before the days of photography. Communication\r\nwith this region was difficult, and travelling hundreds of miles the\r\nstories naturally grew along the way, taking wider outlines and warmer\r\ncoloring. The gold seekers of California varied their explorations\r\nby ascending the Gila, almost as unknown to them as the White Nile.\r\nRapturous reports came back, and for years the Casas Grandes ranked\r\nwith Veii and Karnak. I greatly regret having no copy of those Pacific\r\nnewspapers to compare the impressions of the last generation, groping\r\nin the misty twilight of half-seen wonders, with plain facts come to\r\nactual sight and touch in the light of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe walled cities, capable of holding many thousand souls, were\r\nsupplied with water by acequias leading from the river. They were\r\nrepresented by enthusiastic Bohemians as aqueducts of solid masonry\r\nand fairly equal in durability and strength to the Maxima Cloaca of\r\nRome. Charming traditions embellished the beguiling descriptions,\r\nlovely myths and airy fables floated in the warm, blue silence above\r\nthe House of Montezuma, whose lordly name is itself a stimulus to\r\nimagination. They were the work, so ran the tales, of lost races,\r\nmysterious, invincible, all-conquering, vanished into the voiceless\r\npast. They had reached a high civilization, as the magnificent remains\r\nattest, and had passed from the earth leaving no sign but colossal\r\nruins, no records but strange hieroglyphs, which, engraven on rocks in\r\nthe neighborhood of the Casas, undoubtedly formed their history.\r\n\r\nThese mural records are heaps of weather-worn rocks and detached\r\nboulders covered with figures rudely scratched or painted, bearing\r\nsigns of great age. They possibly served as boundary lines, the\r\nhieroglyphs being tribal signs of treaties. One flighty romancer who\r\nunderstood his own language imperfectly, testified that the “pictured\r\nrocks” were written over with deeply carved inscriptions like the\r\nHebrew, Chaldean and Gothic characters. They have been foundation\r\nstones for imaginary pyramids with sculptured facades, which were\r\ncompared to the temples of Palenque and Tuloom, “made of hewn stone so\r\nadmirably fitted they seem ‘born so’ and require neither mortar nor\r\nclamps.” Pottery was found in profusion, glazed and painted, always\r\nin fragments too small and scattered to be fitted together. Yet the\r\nvisionaries likened the miserable scraps to ceramics of antique India\r\nand the inimitable vases of Etruria.\r\n\r\nFrom the early times the Apache, savagest of savages--the red man\r\nincurably wild--has swept the plains and has held the mountain\r\nfastnesses, carrying terror and torture from the upper waters of the\r\nPecos far into old Mexico. The shadowy region, mountain-locked like\r\nsome vast stronghold guarded by naked sentinels, was a resistless\r\ntemptation to lovers of the marvellous. The deserted cities slowly\r\ncrumbling down by the shallow waters of the Gila must have been\r\nthe work of a people who maintained their supremacy in the face of\r\nsavagery. There was much to stir the fancy, ever strongest of flight\r\nunder skies most unknown, in the idea of walled and fortified cities\r\nin the centre of barbarian hordes, able to withstand their warfare and\r\nbeat back their encroachments. Poet, sightseer, archæologist, reporter,\r\npadre, missionary, rovers of every sort came by turns to the Casas\r\nGrandes, and gave their impressions in poetic coloring; and over all,\r\nlike the dreamy mountain haze whose soft radiance purples hill and\r\nplain, hung a delicious mystery. Who should lift the secret veil and\r\nquestion the past till it gave back some answer? It was an alluring\r\nborderland between civilization and barbarism; on the North American\r\nContinent the last footing of phantoms peopling the unknown, till the\r\nwhistle of the locomotive, which has broken so many illusions, put the\r\npale shades to flight, and brushed away the cobweb and rose-bloom of\r\nthe old Spanish poets.\r\n\r\nThe Maricopa is a dreary country, arid and inhospitable. Even the\r\nMark Tapley of travellers observed, while there: “This is not a jolly\r\nplace.” The days are hot as the desert where the White Nile rises; so\r\nhot the very lion’s manes are burnt off. The nights are heavenly.\r\n\r\nThe rivers are tricksy streams--sometimes wet, sometimes dry--but give\r\nenough water to irrigate meagre cornfields. Occasionally they rise in\r\nthe very centre of barrenness, flow a mile or so, and are lost in the\r\nsand; then rise unexpectedly and run again.\r\n\r\nThe season, I remember, was unusually dry. Every one described by\r\ntravellers and official papers for whole generations contain that\r\nreport. From this concurrent testimony it is safe to conclude that\r\nevery season is unusually dry. I testify that one party was made dry\r\nas mummies; but, being under bonds to see all that was to be seen, we\r\nwere bound for the Casas Grandes.\r\n\r\nTo reach them, we must enter the fabled realm of the visionaries; where\r\nthe Indian emperor, garlanded by beauty, reclining on crimson and gold,\r\nfloated among opal mountains (the name still attaches to a snowy range)\r\nand far-reaching valleys, sown thick with jewels--a region fearful to\r\nland in, because of the one-horned rhinoceros and the monstrous Cibola\r\n(buffalo).\r\n\r\nAs we walked about while waiting for the ambulance, the Indian men\r\ntagged after us, eyeing the travellers with their intolerable fixed\r\nstare; but the women sat still in their places. There was no breeze\r\nto stir the air, no changing clouds enlivening the bare and brilliant\r\nsky, no sound of wheels, no tramp of men audible in the sandy soil. The\r\nisolation was perfect as that of a reef in mid-ocean.\r\n\r\nThe earth lay in stillness unbroken, and the mute and moveless Indian\r\nwoman was the type of a deadness which rests on the land forever.\r\n\r\nWonderful are the works of an inspired imagination! This is the region\r\nwhere the West Indian king reveled as he sailed, and, like another\r\nAntony, kissed away kingdoms and provinces. We had read the chronicles\r\nand saw that day the favorite of the harem, whose voice was like\r\nrunning water in the ear of the thirsty, her step like the bounding\r\nfawn, her grace like the swaying reed, her smile a glance of the Great\r\nSpirit. She is known in our times as the Pimo Squaw. She leaned against\r\na crazy mud wall, which she appeared to prop, and was so nearly the\r\nsame shade of clay that at first the statuesque shape seemed carved in\r\nit. A stumpy figure, nude to the waist draped in one buckskin skirt.\r\nThe leathery skin, tanned by long exposure to the fierce sun’s beat\r\nand roughening wind, was darkly veined and coarse. To eyes accustomed\r\nto see in woman’s form the fairest of all fairness--\r\n\r\n  “A thing to dream of, not to tell”--\r\n\r\nthe sight is not alluring. She was scarcely twenty-five years of age;\r\nbut the pitiless climate (which we are constantly called upon to\r\nadmire) had worn wrinkles in her face deep enough to bury her youth in.\r\nHer small, shapely feet were cased in moccasins; the slim hands, idly\r\nresting in her lap, were burnt to a mahogany color (the cinnamon tint\r\nentirely lost) and knotted with the hard work of corn-grinding. Her one\r\nornament was a sea-shell, tied round her throat by a deer-skin string.\r\n\r\nNourmahal had a Mongol cast of features--narrow button-hole eyes,\r\nalmost no eye-brows, high cheek-bones, thick lips, tattooed chin. As\r\nthe angelic portion of our party (delicately referring to the writer)\r\napproached for nearer view, she made no sign, except to turn the dull\r\nChinese eyes, which a short study of inscriptions on tea-boxes would\r\ngive the right oblique, and fix them on us with a tireless, unwinking\r\ngaze.\r\n\r\nThe ruins are twenty miles from the villages of the Pimos, a branch of\r\nthe Pueblo Indians, and only twelve miles from the town of Florence on\r\nthe South Pacific Railroad. The wagon road runs along the Gila Valley,\r\na level bottom of varying width with abrupt scarped banks of earth. The\r\nplain is of a pale gray color, with a low mossy grass, its monotony\r\nbeing relieved by groves of mezquit, a species of acacia resembling\r\nour locust, but with foliage more delicate and almost shadeless. The\r\nstunted trees grow branching from the ground so low as to be nearly\r\ntrunkless; knotted, gnarled, dwarfed, black of bark, vaster of root\r\nthan of top, yet with a certain grace derived from the small emerald\r\ngreen leaves delicately set on trembling fronds. Occasionally a\r\nval-de-verde appears, a peculiar and striking growth of green body,\r\nbark, leaf and limb, never very large and not over eight inches in\r\ndiameter; and here and there is a prickly pear, twenty feet in height,\r\nloaded with red, pear-shaped fruit.\r\n\r\nThe shifting outlines of the Tucson Mountains, never five minutes\r\nthe same, are drawn in perfect relief against a sky of unrivalled\r\nbrilliance; the purest sapphire, free from every taint of mist, fog, or\r\nvapor. The exquisite fineness of the atmosphere shows clearly the high\r\nand rugged peaks of the Sierra Catarina, and one picture-like summit,\r\ncalled Pichaco, overlooks the chain of hills below through a veil of\r\ndying blue. Close to the river’s brim the willow tosses its branches in\r\nthe eternal west wind, lightly as a lady’s plume, and bears a profusion\r\nof lilac flowers rarely beautiful. On the sterile mesa appears the\r\nsuwarrow (Cereus Giganteus) of a peculiar and fantastic shape, and a\r\nwild verbena repeats the shade of the far-off hill purples.\r\n\r\nMiles away from the dead cities we struck the bed of an ancient\r\nacequia, very large and perfectly defined, the main artery by which\r\nthe river bottom, only a mile or so wide here, was irrigated in former\r\ntimes. Mezquit trees, apparently falling into decay from age, stand\r\nin the dry, abandoned ditches, whose various branches may be traced\r\nin every direction, a network of irrigating canals. Here and there\r\nelevations in the plain proclaim the existence of fallen walls; and\r\ndepressions, from which the earth was used to make the adobe are close\r\nby. Nearer the city of silence, immense quantities of broken pottery\r\nstrew the ground, an arrowhead or stone axe comes to light, and\r\nthe least excitable visitor must admit that the Gila Valley, where\r\ndesolation reigns supreme, was once densely populated. We have, in\r\naddition, the strong testimony of adjacent artificial mounds, supposed\r\nto have been burial places; but the mythical mines of silver and gold\r\nlaid down on the oldest maps, referred to by the oldest missionaries,\r\ndo not yet appear. A popular theory has been held that the Casas were\r\nhabitations of companies of miners who worked undiscovered placers hard\r\nby. Happily this conceit has been exploded.\r\n\r\nThe ruins stand on a low, broad mesa, or table-land, rising slightly\r\nfrom the main road, and are covered by a thicket of mezquit trees not\r\nexceeding twenty feet in height, but concealing the dun-colored walls\r\ntill we were close on them. Passing beyond the leafy screen we saw,\r\nwithin the space of one hundred and fifty yards, three buildings.\r\nTwo are battered and decaying, so ruinous as to baffle the effort of\r\nthe tourist to form an idea of their original size, the shape being,\r\nas in all these remains, a parallelogram. Their walls were standing\r\nsufficiently to trace the plan thirty five years ago.\r\n\r\nWe bent our steps to the main building, largest and best preserved, and\r\nwith a keen sense of disappointment beheld the structure so dear to\r\narchæologists and known for three centuries as the House of Montezuma.\r\nThough familiar by picture and description, I had thought to find some\r\ndisplay of regal power in architectural grace and finish; remnants of\r\nmouldings, broken lines of cornices, and at least one lofty portal\r\nthrough which the tawny courtiers might have filed in barbaric pomp to\r\nsalute the Rocky Mountain King. It is merely a tremendous mud house,\r\non which the centuries have spent their strength in vain, standing in\r\nthe hush of utter solitude, battling time and the elements. There is\r\nnothing picturesque about it. No friendly lichen, running creeper or\r\ntrailing ivy can live in this dry dewless air and with tender verdure\r\nclothe the nakedness of the ragged structure. Against the sand blast\r\nno wreathing vine can cling, and in its embrace soften the mass of\r\nugliness harshly outlined against the bare and brilliant sky, unflecked\r\nby cloud or shadow. Our spirits went down, down before the legendary\r\nPalace of Montezuma we had come so far to see. For this we had strained\r\nover lava beds, through the sunburnt ways of the wilderness, across\r\nvalleys of sand, sage desert, and greasewood plain, breathing, eating,\r\ndrinking alkali, and wearing its dust like a dingy travelling suit!\r\nInstead of poetry here was certainty.\r\n\r\nThe mountain rim was a refreshment to the vision. There the aerial\r\nhues, so like the stuff which dreams are made of, gave the only ideal\r\ntouch to a scene forbiddingly real. No hint of beauty or excellence of\r\nworkmanship is found in a near view of the Casa, which is entitled to\r\nadmiration only on account of its age, and to a hold on fancy because\r\nits origin and uses are unknown. Desolate and isolated now, time\r\nwas when it was encircled by similar buildings grouped in villages\r\nscattered broadly over the wide plateau. In every direction are broken\r\nlines of fallen walls, oblong heaps crumbled down to the dust whence\r\nthey sprung; and the extent of irrigation must have made the valley a\r\ncultivated garden, or a field of corn large enough to sustain a vast\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nBut there was little time for sentiment. Our surveys must be made in\r\nhaste. The walls are entirely adobe; in no portion is there any stone\r\nused. Instead of the modern Spanish-American adobes, moulded to about\r\nsix times the size of our ordinary bricks, this aboriginal “palace” is\r\nbuilt of large blocks of concrete (called by Mexicans tapia), three\r\nfeet or more in length, by two feet in width and thickness. They are\r\nof irregular size, indicating that a box or mould was used in the\r\nmanufacture into which the mortar was cast where it was to remain\r\nin the walls; and as it dried the cases were moved along. A recent\r\nchemical analysis of the concrete shows the secret of its durability\r\nunder the wasting and wearing of ages in a structure certainly a ruin\r\nfor three hundred years, and with a pre-Spanish existence of a century\r\nand perhaps more. Seventeen per cent. of the mortar is carbonate of\r\nlime. Probably lime was burned and mixed with the sand and gravel of\r\nthe country, which contains a very adhesive clay, tough and lasting.\r\n\r\nThe walls are perpendicular within, slightly tapering without, four\r\nfeet thick, facing the cardinal points of the compass, almost the true\r\nmeridian. The building was fifty-eight feet long and forty-three feet\r\nwide, the highest point of the standing wall being thirty-five feet.\r\nIt was originally four or five stories high, being about eight feet\r\nfrom floor to ceiling. In the centre of each wall were narrow doors for\r\nentrance into the main compartments, three feet wide, five feet high,\r\nand growing narrower at the top, except the one in the west front,\r\nwhich is two feet by seven or eight. Over each door is a port-hole\r\nwhose dimensions I am unable to give. The Indian’s love of dark houses\r\nis apparent here; the only light admitted into the small numerous rooms\r\nwas through these holes in the deep walls. The central room, with\r\nonly one opening, must have been as dismal as a dungeon. It has been\r\nsurmised that this was a sort of watch-tower, eight or ten feet higher\r\nthan the outer stories, probably one story above all the rest when the\r\nCasa was entire. Some of the port-holes have been filled in with mortar\r\nas though the window, if window it was, admitted too much light.\r\n\r\nFather Font, who visited this ruin in 1776, writes: “It is perceptible\r\nthe edifice had three stories. The Indians say it had four; the last\r\nbeing a kind of subterranean vault. For the purpose of giving light to\r\nthe rooms nothing is seen but the doors, and some round holes in the\r\nmiddle of the walls which face to the east and west, and the Indians\r\nsaid that the Prince, whom they called the ‘Bitter Man,’ used to salute\r\nthe sun through these holes (which are pretty large) at its rising and\r\nsetting. All the roofs are burnt out except that of one low room, in an\r\nadjoining house, which had beams, apparently cedar, small and smooth,\r\nand over them reeds of equal size and a layer of hard mud and mortar,\r\nforming a very curious roof, or floor.”\r\n\r\nThe different stories are easily identified by the ends of beams\r\nremaining in the walls, or by the holes into which the beams projected.\r\nThey are round rafters of cedar, or sabino, supporting the floors,\r\nbeing perhaps six inches in diameter and half a foot apart. The nearest\r\nmountain bearing such trees is many a weary mile away. The charred\r\nends of beams prove that the interior was destroyed by fire, but the\r\nmassive four-foot wall suffered no change by flaming floor, rafter,\r\nor roof. The trees were hacked by a blunt tool, probably a stone\r\nhatchet; evidently iron was unknown to the architect of Casas Grandes.\r\nThe Indigene substituted for it tempered copper and tools of wrought\r\nobsidian. A few bone awls, or flakers, for making arrow heads, have\r\nbeen dug out of the gravel, and a metate, or corn grinder, broken jars\r\nand a tomahawk of flint, have been found, but there is no tracery made\r\nby iron.\r\n\r\nAdobe walls are wonderfully durable in this dry, equable climate, and\r\nwith slight repairs last a thousand years. Disintegration begins at the\r\nbase, where moisture gathers, and the walls, seamed and furrowed near\r\nthe earth by the action of heavy yearly rains, are held together merely\r\nby their great thickness. Their inner surface is smoothly plastered\r\nwith lime cement, little wrinkled marks standing as they appeared when\r\nfirst dried after the finish was laid on. There is no sign of stairway,\r\nand ascent was probably made outside on scaling ladders, as the Pueblos\r\ngo up their terraced domiciles throughout New Mexico and Arizona. The\r\nrough coating without is flaked off in some places by the continuous\r\naction of warring winds which carry sand. Even more than rain, this\r\nincessant agent is operating on the old dun-colored adobes, and unless\r\nrepairs are made in the scarred and furrowed foundations, this most\r\ninteresting of antiquities must before long become a shapeless wreck.\r\nThere can have been no considerable shock of earthquake in the period\r\nduring which it has been known to us; even a slight tremble would bring\r\nthe time-worn fabric down to hopeless destruction.\r\n\r\nStanding on the mesa, the traveller sees in every direction heaps\r\nof ruins, of which the Casas Grandes was the centre and principal.\r\nAbout two hundred yards to the northwest is a circular inclosure,\r\nalso a ruin. It is supposed to have been a corral for cattle, which,\r\nunless, as some assume, it was used as a menagerie, would make it of\r\nmore recent date, as the Indians were without domestic animals before\r\nthe conquest. Architectural remains have been well called the balance\r\nwheels of tradition. After actual sight and touch there is no room for\r\ndreams and visions. Temples and towers proclaim worship, sculptures\r\nhint of refinement, wealth and elegant tastes. Coins tell of commerce,\r\nand frescoes like those of Pompeii and Rome are illuminated books of\r\nChronicles.\r\n\r\nThis antique pile is expressive of a low condition of art. Its size is\r\nimpressive when we consider that it was completed without the aid of\r\ndomestic animals or iron, but by hand labor alone. The only idea left\r\nin the mind of the visitor is that it was designed to accommodate great\r\nnumbers of persons; a cumbrous human hive. There is no forest growth\r\nabove it by which to date the passage of years; and the ceaseless\r\ndelving of the archæologist has failed to find a key, accepted by all\r\nas the true one, to the age and purpose of so remarkable a building.\r\nExcavations made on an appropriation by the Legislature of Arizona\r\nresulted in nothing. A citizen of Florence reports finding a piece of\r\ngold resembling coin in the debris, and it is said that a hollow sound\r\nhas been heard by those jumping on the floor of the inner room. Part\r\nof the walls have fallen, which may account for the noise. That ghost\r\nis laid and no voice or breath of living thing disturbs the dreaming\r\npilgrim and baffled antiquarian as in mournful procession they carry\r\noff their relics--bits of broken plaster and pottery.\r\n\r\nThe earliest reporters describe eleven buildings in close proximity to\r\neach other, and there can be no reason to doubt their record, judging\r\nby the high heaps of mud and gravel lying in every direction about the\r\ngreat Casa. Compassing it is a prostrate wall extending four hundred\r\nand twenty feet from north to south, and two hundred and sixty feet\r\nfrom east to west, which they believed was a part of the Casa itself--a\r\nnatural mistake which has given many a highly exaggerated idea of the\r\nstructure inclosed by it.\r\n\r\nThe first recorded mention of Casas Grandes is made in 1540, by\r\nCaptains Diaz and Saldibar, who with twelve intrepid men marched from\r\nthe city of Culiacan and ascended the Gila as far as Chichiticale, or\r\nRed House, on the border of the Colorado Desert. They had from friendly\r\nIndians glowing descriptions of the seven cities of Cibola, in which\r\nwhole streets were said to be occupied exclusively by workers in gold\r\nand silver. “They had sculptured silver and spear heads and drinking\r\ncups of precious metals.” Fired by these beguiling fables Coronado\r\nled a little army of picked men, fifty soldiers, a few infantry,\r\nhis particular friends and the monks, in search of fairy land, the\r\nvanishing seven cities of Cibola. His secretary records that when the\r\ngeneral passed through all the inhabited region to the place where the\r\ndesert begins and saw there was “nothing good,” he could not repress\r\nhis sadness notwithstanding the marvels which were promised further on.\r\n\r\nThe traveller of 1880 has much the same sensation as that which smote\r\nthe soul of the dashing Coronado of 1540. In the time of the latter\r\nthe whole of the North American Continent east of the Rio Grande was\r\ncalled Florida. It is not surprising that much inaccurate information\r\nprevailed regarding the geography of Nueva Espagna, but it is easy\r\nto identify Casas Grandes with the “Red House” standing in a mezquit\r\njungle on the edge of the desert, the first ruin seen on the Gila\r\nby one ascending from its mouth. In certain lights the walls have a\r\nreddish tint, and again appear white on account of pebbles contained in\r\nthe plaster.\r\n\r\nIn 1694 Father Kino visited the Casas Grandes. He heard traditions of\r\nthe Pimos running back four hundred years; it had been a ruin for\r\nages, and was destroyed by fire in the war with the Apaches. “The\r\nprincipal room in the middle is four stories, the adjoining rooms on\r\nits four sides are of three stories, with walls so smooth and shining\r\nthat they appear like burnished tables. At the distance of an arquebuss\r\nshot, twelve other houses were to be seen, also half fallen, having\r\nthick walls, and all the ceilings burnt except in the lower room of one\r\nhouse.” He mentions also canals for irrigation, “which had capacity for\r\ncarrying half the water of the river.” The good priest took peaceable\r\npossession of the forsaken spot, set up the cross within the dreary\r\nwalls and made the place a holy shrine with the celebration of mass.\r\n\r\nOf the old descriptions that of Father Font, who visited the scene in\r\n1779, is most valuable. I regret not having space for a longer extract\r\nfrom his journal: “The large house or Palace of Montezuma,” he says,\r\n“according to the histories and meagre accounts of it which we have\r\nfrom the Indians, may have been built some 500 years ago; for, as it\r\nappears, this building was erected by the Mexicans when, during their\r\ntransmigration, the Devil led them through various countries until\r\nthey arrived at the promised land of Mexico; and in their sojourns,\r\nwhich were long ones, they formed towns and built edifices.” He further\r\nspeaks of ruins in every direction. “The land is partially covered with\r\npieces of pots, jars, plates, etc.” He was the first one who discovered\r\nthat the outer wall was a fortification, “a fence which surrounded this\r\nhouse and other buildings.” Within the last thirty years the Casa de\r\nMontezuma has been often described, and so much speculation has been\r\nexpended as to its origin and uses that I hesitate to push out into\r\nthat dark sea.\r\n\r\nThere is a succession of ruined cities, forming a continuous chain\r\nof evidence, from Utah to the City of Mexico. I have examined many\r\nof these dead pueblos and can discover no essential in which they\r\ndiffer from each other, from the living pueblos now inhabited, or from\r\nthe Casas Grandes. All are community houses, where a whole tribe may\r\ndwell, built of adobe in the shape of an oblong square around an open\r\ncourt. Inclosing this was an outer wall or fortification with towers\r\nat regular intervals for the posting of sentinels. The old pueblos\r\nwere built on a table land so as to afford an outlook for sentries\r\nand an opportunity for watching depredations on the corn lands in\r\nthe valleys below; and often at a distance are found the remains of\r\na circular watch-tower, a signal station near the city. Such are the\r\nprehistoric vestiges along the McElmo, Colorado, San Juan and the Rio\r\nMancos, and the widely dispersed remains in the Ehaco and Mancho. Such\r\nis the solitary watch-tower in the Cañon of the Hovenweep, Utah. The\r\nnorthernmost buildings discovered in Arizona and Colorado are exact\r\ncopies of the Southern and Moqui pueblos, varying with situation and\r\nwith the quality of material used. Generally the earth of the country\r\nwas mixed with ashes and clay. The lack of individuality in the Indian\r\nrace gives you the feeling that if you see one you have seen all; so\r\nit is in regard to their habitations. The sameness of the remains, and\r\ntheir close likeness to the Casas Grandes and the modern buildings,\r\nmust strike the most careless observer. Yet they are not more alike\r\nthan the builders themselves.\r\n\r\nThere are few, if any antiquities, that have not been searched through\r\nand through and reported on. The hunter, miner, scout, surveyor, priest\r\nand sightseer have overlooked no hill or plain where there is a trace\r\nof human dwelling. Undoubtedly the adobe houses wherever found are the\r\nwork of a semi-civilized, agricultural people with whom the Spaniards\r\ncame in conflict, and who are described by them as Pueblo, or Town\r\nIndians, to distinguish them from the nomads or wandering tribes of the\r\nprimitive race. An immense amount of romance has been wasted on the old\r\nmud houses, which makes them hardly less wonderful than the enchanted\r\ncity Tiahuanco, which was built in a single night by an invisible hand;\r\nbut the time is come to put out wavering lights and to banish shifting\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that the Palace of Montezuma was designed as a fortress,\r\na centre from which many villages radiated and to which the inhabitants\r\nfled for refuge in a last extremity. The lightness of the floor rafters\r\nin the lower story precludes the possibility that the building was used\r\nas a granary. Any one of the many rooms full of grain must have crushed\r\nthe floors, if not the walls themselves. Again, it has been declared\r\nto have been a temple for the sun worshippers; but the smallness and\r\nmultiplicity of the rooms and the many doors and port holes oppose such\r\na surmise, though the dismal central room and the circular passages\r\nbetween the rooms might suggest priestcraft, and heathen rites and\r\nsorceries.\r\n\r\nIt may have been, like the castle of the middle ages, the nucleus\r\naround which the city gradually grew up, but more probably it rose\r\nfrom the needs of the citizens, many of whom must have toiled in its\r\nerection. For many, many years the Apache has harried this land. It\r\nis the Indian law to destroy all that he cannot carry away, and the\r\npottery is always broken, the interiors are always fired. The builders\r\nof adobe houses, wherever found, were open to incursions of the same\r\nenemy which still infests the Mexican border. To me these remains have\r\nno new meanings. They merely prove that the North American Continent\r\nhas been inhabited from a remote period; something which I believe has\r\nnever been disputed.\r\n\r\nThe undated tradition is that the spot which I am trying to describe\r\nis one of the stopping places of Montezuma on his southward march to\r\nAnahuac. All legends point to an emigration from north to south. Coming\r\nfrom the ends of the earth, or from fabled Azatlan, the first halt the\r\nMontezumas made was at old Zuni; this was the second station; the third\r\nwas near Chihuahua, Mexico, where enormous ruins, exact reproductions\r\nof these are standing isolated in a luxuriant valley, the tottering\r\nmonuments of a peculiar tribe or tribes of a bygone nationality.\r\nNothing is to be learned from the natives there, who, like all Pueblos,\r\nlove to call themselves sons of Montezuma, or from the Mexicans round\r\nabout. Whatever requires a moment’s thought is dismissed by the\r\never-ready, meaningless, _Quien sabe?_ “Who knows?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV. TO THE CASAS GRANDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Casas Grandes on the Laguna de Guzman in Northwestern Chihuahua\r\nare similar in every respect to the ruined fortresses of New Mexico\r\nand Arizona. The points of resemblance are so close and so numerous\r\nas to be decisive, proving them to be the work of the same people\r\nunder similar, though somewhat superior, institutions. On my table is\r\nan unbroken vase unearthed from this most venerable ruin of North\r\nAmerica: a veritable antique, rare and valuable. It is of a light clay\r\ncolor, glazed without and within. The shape, the peculiar markings in\r\ngeometrical lines, white, black and maroon red, prove the hand of its\r\nmanufacturer. I should recognize it instantly in any collection as a\r\nPueblo water jar of ancient workmanship, better made than any which we\r\nhave from the Pueblos now. It contains the following memorandum: “This\r\n_olla_ or _tanaja_ was excavated from the ruins of the Montezuma Casas\r\nGrandes in the State of Chihuahua in the year 1864, and according to\r\nIndian tradition is 800 years old. These Casas Grandes (great houses)\r\nwere reduced to ruin, by siege, in 1070.” This is signed, “William\r\nPierson, American Consul in 1873.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tesuke Water Vases.]\r\n\r\nIt is the only whole jar and much the finest specimen I have ever\r\nseen. Still it is greatly inferior to the coarsest Wedgwood china in\r\nour shops. There has never appeared a monument or relic proving the\r\nexistence of a people of more advanced culture than the red race with\r\nwhich the European came in contact. How the peculiar civilization which\r\nthis vase represents came from the North, as every tradition declares\r\nit did, is a question that has been argued many times in many ways.\r\nAmong a vanquished, declining people, without even the lowest forms\r\nof picture-writing, language rapidly alters; and philologists tell us\r\nthat American languages are the most changeful forms of human speech.\r\nLegends soon become confused; the links of connection are easily\r\nlost; and even in its best estate tradition is treacherous as memory.\r\nScholars have held that the adobe houses are traces of the Toltecs,\r\nthe polished predecessors of the fierce and bloody Aztecs, under whose\r\ndominion the former broke and scattered. Plausible theories, more or\r\nless conclusive, have perplexed the student of indigenous races. One\r\nsolution, as soon as it was suggested, touched me with the force of\r\nabsolute conviction, because it was so direct and simple an answer to\r\nthe puzzling questions following an examination of the antiquities of\r\nNorth America.\r\n\r\nThe Pueblo or town-building Indians were the skirmish line of the Aztec\r\nnation when the Mexican Empire was in the height of its greatness.\r\nThe Aztecs were restless, aggressive, greedy of power and insatiate\r\nin their lust for dominion. To rove and to conquer was the national\r\npastime. The green banners of Anahuac floated defiantly in the tropic\r\nairs of the remotest provinces on the Gulf of Mexico, and dauntless\r\nwarriors upheld their colors in pristine splendor along the extreme\r\ncoasts of Honduras and Nicaragua. They formed the unshackled, sovereign\r\nnation, possessing the highest civilization in North America, speaking\r\na language by far the most finished and elegant of the native tongues,\r\nsaid to be of exceeding richness.\r\n\r\nThe Pueblos, whom we believe to be a rough off-shoot of that stock,\r\ndegraded descendants of haughty princes, are yet a self-sustaining\r\npeople, independent of the Government, the only aborigines among us not\r\na curse to the soil. In some old time whereof history is silent and\r\nabout which there are no traditions, nor even the airy hand of a misty\r\nlegend to beckon us back and point the way, the half-civilized tribes\r\nof Mexico must have sought fresh fields for conquest and occupation.\r\nThey probably marched in detached clans speaking different dialects,\r\nbut more or less united under one central government, and with the\r\narts and means of instruction brought from Anahuac they set forth to\r\ncolonize outlying countries to the north. A glance at the map shows\r\nonly one route by which they could advance. West of the Sierra Madre\r\nand up the Gila and its tributaries, toward the great cañon of the\r\nColorado, colonies were planted along the river banks, and possibly\r\nthe emigrant fraternized with the native. Captain Fernando Alarcon\r\ndiscovered the Rio Colorado in 1540, and passed various tribes without\r\nbeing able to communicate with them, except by signs, until he reached\r\na people who understood the language of an Indian whom he had brought\r\nfrom Mexico. From this tribe he learned of a similar people, far to the\r\neastward, who lived in great houses built of stone. From Mexico the\r\nSoutherners brought the art of building with adobe and with stones laid\r\nin mud mortar, which alone distinguishes them from the tribes dwelling\r\nin wigwams, shifting tents and lodges of buffalo skins and boughs.\r\nThere was a system of communication between their fortified towns,\r\nworn footpaths betraying a constant coming and going, and deep trails\r\nfurrowed by the tread of busy feet through centuries.\r\n\r\nThe ancient builders invariably chose commanding positions overlooking\r\ntheir cultivated fields for their pueblos, and added story after story\r\nto the houses, usually terraced from without, where a few defenders\r\ncould defy almost any number of assailants with savage arms. Apaches\r\nwere treated as barbarian hordes. There is no mention of these Bedouins\r\nuntil a century after Coronado’s day, from which fact we may infer that\r\nthey were kept at bay.\r\n\r\nGradually the tide of emigration pressed up to the Aztec Mountains and\r\nSan Francisco Peaks, but there the march of the victorious invader was\r\nsuddenly stopped by a barrier utterly impassable--the cañons of the\r\nColorado and Chiquito Rivers, which, united, form a gulf at least 300\r\nmiles long, and which in places are a mile in depth. It lay directly\r\nacross their course, a stupendous chasm which wings only would have\r\nenabled them to cross. No sea or desert could so effectually have\r\nhindered their progress northward. They turned toward the East, took\r\npossession of the rich valleys of the Colorado and Chiquito, where\r\nstreets of towns and irrigating canals are still traceable for miles,\r\nand followed its branches to their sources. All the towns are along\r\nthe river. The bottom lands are fertile with alluvial deposits. There\r\nare large cotton-wood trees and impenetrable thickets of arrow and\r\ngreasewood among the numberless lagoons and sloughs which, at the\r\nannual rise of the river, are filled to overflowing and irrigate the\r\nsoil. But no vegetation can live beyond the limit of these overflows.\r\nA white efflorescence covers the ground, where it is useless to plant,\r\nwhere nothing edible for man or beast will grow.\r\n\r\nOn the neighboring streams the chiefs founded the kingdom of Cibola,\r\nwhere now we see extensive ruins attesting the size of the old towns,\r\nall of which were fortified and built on the same general plan. Old\r\nTuni was the capital city, set on a hill of rock and reached only by\r\none zigzag path, where a handful of soldiers could defy the cavalry of\r\nthe world. In a similar condition the ruins of the seven Moqui villages\r\nare found, and North of them is the site of an adjacent colony. To\r\nthe northeast they moved from the head of Flax River to the southern\r\ntributaries of the San Juan, the Cañon de Chaco and the Valle de\r\nChelly, “where,” says Lieutenant McCormick, “half a million might have\r\nlived,” being strewn with the ruins of dead cities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ABANDONED PUEBLO.]\r\n\r\nAt last, by following up the headwaters of the Rio de San Juan\r\nto the Colorado Mountains, they penetrated the Rio Grande Valley,\r\na fertile and widely extended region destined to be subdued and\r\ncolonized. From this point their imperious course was down the valley\r\nfrom the north, as all traditions point; and, naturally, the conquerors\r\nbuilt a vast stronghold at Taos to protect that beautiful valley from\r\nattacks of the wild tribes, mainly Utes--a gloomy, forbidding citadel\r\nof savage aspect, set on a hill overlooking the Rio Grande. So strong a\r\nretreat is it that in 1847, when the Mexicans of the modern village of\r\nTaos could no longer defend themselves against the armies of the United\r\nStates, they fled to this abandoned pueblo, a few miles distant, and\r\nthere sustained a protracted siege, yielding finally when provisions\r\nutterly failed. The grim and threatening fortress was never captured\r\nby the Spaniards, though many times attacked. The terraces bristled\r\nwith spears and battle-axes, through the little windows arrows were\r\nshowered, and stones and burning balls of cotton dipped in oil were\r\nhurled from slings. The lower story, a well-filled granary--and the\r\ncisterns within the court, enabled the red men “to laugh a siege to\r\nscorn.”\r\n\r\nThe route which we have rapidly sketched was discovered and maintained\r\nby the armies of many generations; the changes described in a paragraph\r\nwere brought about by wars lasting through ages. Well did those\r\nmigratory tribes know the fierce delight of battle which thrills alike\r\nthe blood of the white man and the red, when once within the heat and\r\nfury of its deadly charm.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time the entire valley of the Rio Grande from latitude\r\n37° to latitude 32°, a distance of over 400 miles, was thickly settled.\r\nIt must have been a scene of constant activity, with its clusters of\r\ntowns, whose streets are yet plainly visible and may be followed for\r\nmiles; and becoming the dominant nation, in the main valley where the\r\nvillages are nearest to each other, the Aztecs found it unnecessary to\r\nfortify their dwelling places. Out-lying settlements, such as Pecos\r\nand Grand Quivira, in the country swept by Comanches and Arapahoes,\r\nand Laguna and Acoma, near the Navajos, were defended by outworks like\r\nthose in the Colorado basin.\r\n\r\nNear El Paso are widespread ruins of the prehistoric epoch, and it is\r\nso short a march from that crossing to the lovely and productive valley\r\nof Rio Corralites and its lake, the Laguna de Guzman, that it is most\r\nreasonable to suppose the casas on this stream were built by a colony\r\nfrom that region. The Indians and Mexicans of our day are exactly\r\nright in asserting that the “great houses” are the work of Montezumas\r\nwho came from the North, and at various stations fortified themselves\r\nagainst the roving tribes. So it comes that the Town Builders of\r\nNew Mexico and Arizona, who are without history or hieroglyphic\r\nwriting, have no record or even legend of the dim and distant starting\r\npoint when the exodus from Mexico began. They brought a species\r\nof civilization quite foreign to the nomads who confronted them,\r\nbattled for supremacy, and disputed their sway. The civilization was\r\nnecessarily inferior to that of the source whence it sprung. This is\r\nthe condition in all migratory movements. The wealthy, cultured classes\r\nare conservative, slow to change; the dissatisfied spirits, adventurers\r\nwith little to leave or to take, strike out of the beaten paths in hope\r\nof bettering their fortunes.\r\n\r\nThe colonial beginnings were a poor representation of the splendors\r\nof Tezcuco where North American civilization, under the commanding\r\ngenius of the second Montezuma, reached its height. But the pilgrims\r\nbrought with them glorious memories. They must have seen the sacred\r\ncity Cholula, with its 400 temples, its huge pyramid, wrought by the\r\ngiant Haloc, nearly 200 feet high, the sides measuring 450 yards at\r\nits base. It was a terraced tower, a landmark, a beacon and a shrine\r\nto all Anahuac, where the smoke from the undying altar-fires went up\r\nas incense to the gods, new every morning and fresh every evening.\r\nThere were no writhing victims on that hill of sacrifice; the gentle\r\nQuetzelcoatl delighted not in blood; his offerings were bread and\r\nroses and all sweet perfumes. The townsmen in their new homes built\r\ncouncil-houses, meagre and poverty-stricken compared with the Southern\r\ntemples, and kindled the sacred fires. Each village had one or more of\r\nthese estufas, where holy rites were conducted in the utmost secrecy. A\r\npriesthood of chosen warriors, consecrated to the ministry, watched the\r\naltar-fire, and it was never suffered to die out.\r\n\r\nIn all probability the later emigrants brought with them the Montezuma\r\nidol. Possibly some had been in the kneeling ranks of those who kissed\r\nthe earth at the sound of conch and atabal which heralded the approach\r\nof the great king, the child of the sun. Hardly had they dared to lift\r\ntheir eyes, before the splendor of the canopy of green featherwork\r\nfringed with sparkling pendants, which shaded his jewelled plumes.\r\nThey could not fail to remember the floating robes of gorgeous dyes,\r\nthe blazing arms making the glance dizzy with the shining of precious\r\nstones; and, best of all, that princely presence in the midst of\r\nworshipping subjects, who held themselves but as dust beneath the\r\ngolden soles of the royal sandals. They could not forget the wall of\r\norbed shields about his sacred person, the keen sparkle of burnished\r\nspear tips, the flying flags of various colors which the Indian loves\r\nso well, and the shouts of thousands on thousands of loyal subjects who\r\ncounted not their lives dear unto themselves but for their service to\r\ntheir emperor. The all-conquering Montezuma was at first only a proud\r\nmemory. By degrees a halo and a light appeared round the name of the\r\nking of kings. Men love to trace their descent back to some storied\r\ngreatness, and all barbarous nations delight to associate their origin\r\nwith the deities. The yearning to be as gods is one of the instinctive\r\nimpulses of the human heart. It began in Eden and is as old as the\r\nfirst man.\r\n\r\nFrom reverence of the compelling spirit which left its imprint on\r\nvast regions, various tribes and long periods of time, it is easy to\r\npass to adoration. The valley of the Rio Grande was once a valley of\r\ngods; they breathed in the winds, frowned in the storms; their wrath\r\nwas the earthquake and their smile was fair weather. The central idea\r\nceaselessly recurring in the pantheistic religion of the Pueblos of\r\nthe nineteenth century is the shining figure of Montezuma, and their\r\nbelief in his return is the dearest of all their faiths. As in the\r\nGreek legends, we cannot define the line between myth and history,\r\nbut we are forced to believe so widespread a religion must have had a\r\nbeginning remote from the degraded, broken-hearted creatures who pray\r\nto him daily. The dim memories of a great past never quite fade away\r\nfrom among any people. The dreamy, mythical, departed grandeur of their\r\nancestors has led the Pueblos to the hope of a restoration; for with\r\nthem the vague past and the indefinite future are both better than the\r\ndull, tame present. The hope in every breast, slow to die, if indeed\r\nit ever dies, looks to a regeneration, a lifting up of the bowed race\r\nso mercilessly stricken down by the Spaniards. The caciques who guard\r\nthe sacred fires watch at the daybreak for the second coming of the\r\nlawgiver, prophet and priest, and pray with faces toward the sun-house\r\nwhere he takes his kingly rest in the abode of his fathers. In the\r\ngolden dawn of some morning, fairest where all are fair, he shall push\r\nback the curtains of his tabernacle intolerably bright, and with roll\r\nof drums, music of reeds and beauty of banners shall return to his own\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIt is the tendency, even in carefully recorded annals, to make one man\r\nthe doer of all heroic deeds. The unnamed dead live in the life of one\r\nking of men. The lesser lights wane and pale before its splendor, and\r\nfinally all mingle in a resplendent focus, and one immortal stands\r\nforever the representative of the epoch, a sceptred deity. Such are\r\nthe demigods of Southern Europe: such is the fair-haired Odin of the\r\nmead-drinking warriors in sheepskin and horsehide; such is King Arthur,\r\ngone away under promise to return from\r\n\r\n        The island valley of Avilion,\r\n  Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,\r\n  Nor ever wind blows loudly.\r\n\r\nAnd such is the Messiah of the Town Builders, brother of the sun, equal\r\nof the one Omnipotent God, uncreated and eternal, whose name it is\r\ndeath to utter.\r\n\r\nTried by the delicate test of language, there is no analogy between\r\nthe modern Town Builder and the Mexican of the South; but this is not\r\nconclusive. Centuries of changing environment work miraculous changes\r\nin any people. How much is the modern Briton like his ancestor, the\r\ncave dweller, clad in skins of the beasts which almost shared his\r\nden, living on roots and bowing down at strange altars? Even in the\r\nsame generation, in the best age of the most enlightened of kingdoms,\r\nhow much does the Irish gentleman resemble his degraded tenant, the\r\npeat-digger? Nay, they can scarcely comprehend each other’s speech.\r\nOf the heroes, numbered by hundreds of thousands, who upheld our\r\nvictorious banner during the great Rebellion, how many names will\r\nremain at end of the year 2880? Possibly one. The least observant\r\ntraveller through the country of the Pueblos must notice that it has\r\nchanged for the worse since the “great houses” were built. They stand\r\non the rim of the Colorado Desert, and if we accept the theory of the\r\ngeologists that this is the dry bed of an inland sea, the climate must\r\nonce have been very unlike what it is now--waterless ten months of\r\nthe year, and at summer noon as hot and as stifling as the air of a\r\nlimekiln. Scientists unite in testifying that the rainfall west of the\r\nRio Grande is much less than formerly. The present streams are shrunken\r\nthreads of those which once flowed in their channels when forests were\r\nmore abundant. Northern Arizona has hills whose bases are covered\r\nwith dead cedar trees, immense belts untouched by fire, proving that\r\nthe conditions friendly to the growth of vegetation are restricted to\r\nnarrowing limits. Spots that have been productive are barren; springs\r\ngushed from the ground which at present is dry and parched, and an\r\nagricultural people has lived where now no living being could maintain\r\nexistence. Everything indicates that this region was formerly better\r\nwatered. Many rivers of years ago are now rivers of sand, and the Gila\r\nat its best, after gathering the confluent streams, San Pedro and\r\nSalado, is not so large in volume as an Indiana creek. Ethnologists\r\ntry to prove that the Town Builders came from the extreme North,\r\nperhaps originally from Kamtchatka, and that the adobe houses and\r\nMontezuma worship were of indigenous growth, founded by the monarch\r\nwho bears the proudest name in Indian history. There are no Pueblos\r\nNorth of the thirty-seventh parallel, and the decline of the race began\r\nlong before the Spanish invasion. It will be remembered that the Casas\r\nGrandes was a roofless, crumbling ruin, without a history more than 300\r\nyears ago. The Pueblos must have been a mighty nation in the prime of\r\ntheir strength, and legends of their ancient glory before they passed\r\nunder the hated Spanish yoke are cherished among the different tribes.\r\nReduced as they were in numbers and power, their battle for freedom was\r\na long and gallant struggle. They were finally brought into subjection,\r\neven to the Moquis who lived perched in tiny houses on scarred, seamed\r\ncliffs of volcanic rock, where nature’s fires are burnt out, in a\r\nbarren country, arid and inhospitable, absolutely worthless to white\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Zuñi Paint and Condiment Cups.]\r\n\r\nNever was life so lonely and cheerless as in the desolate hovels of\r\nthe Moquis. Their land is not a tender solitude, but a forbidding\r\ndesolation of escarped cliffs, overlooking wastes of sand where the\r\nwinds wage war on the small shrubs and venturesome grasses, leaving to\r\nthe drouth such as they cannot uproot. A few scrubby trees, spotting\r\nthe edge of the plain as if they had looked across the waterless waste\r\nand crouched in fear, furnish a little brushwood for the fires of the\r\nMoquis, who are fighting out the battle for existence that is hardly\r\nworth the struggle. Fixed habitation anywhere implies some sort of\r\ncivilization. The flinty hills are terraced, and by careful irrigation\r\nthey manage to raise corn enough to keep body and soul together.\r\nThe seven villages within a circuit of ten miles have been isolated\r\nfrom the rest of the world through centuries, yet they have so little\r\nintercourse with each other that their tribal languages, everywhere\r\nsubject to swift mutations, are entirely unlike. Diminutive, low-set\r\nmen wrapped in blankets passively sitting on the bare, seared rocks in\r\nthe sun, are the ghastly proprietors of a reservation once the scene\r\nof busy activities. They number only 1,600 souls; shreds of tribes\r\nalmost exhausted, surrounded by dilapidated cities unquestionably of\r\ngreat antiquity. The sad heirship of fallen greatness is written in the\r\nemptiness of their barren estates. Fragments of pottery are profusely\r\nscattered about; and deeply-worn foot-paths leading from village\r\nto village, down the river bank and winding up to the plain, mark\r\nthe ancient thoroughfares which are now slightly trodden or utterly\r\ndeserted.\r\n\r\nHow the Indians were enslaved and driven to the mines, and how they\r\nperished there by thousands, is a matter of familiar history. They were\r\nan abject and heart-broken people after the Conquest, and their decline\r\nstill goes steadily on. Whole tribes are extinct. Others have united\r\nwith each other for safety, and within the memory of citizens of Santa\r\nFé the feeble remnant of the tribe at Pecos joined that at Jemez, which\r\nspeaks the same language.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the question is not so much whence they come as whither\r\nthey go. The human family is never at rest; its condition is one\r\nof change. From the beginning nations and peoples have come and\r\ngone--vanished, where? Who knows? Who cares? They moved forward in\r\nthe resistless march, served the end for which they were created,\r\ndied and were forgotten. They come like shadows, so depart. Across\r\nthese desolate Rocky Mountain ranges a turbulent stream of humanity\r\nonce ebbed and flowed in perpetual unrest. Then there were tribes\r\nchasing, tribes fleeing, nation rising up against nation, scattering,\r\nabsorbing, driving each other into annihilation; and the hills echoed\r\nthe triumphant music of the scalp dances over the graves of slain\r\nthousands. The history of those mighty turmoils and revolutions must\r\nremain forever unwritten. The present aborigines are but a forlorn\r\nwreck of what they were in the long ago, when mountain princes from the\r\nSouth were supreme rulers in a realm of confederacies, whose boundaries\r\ncannot be measured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pueblo Wristlets, Moccasins, etc.]\r\n\r\nThe civilization of the Town Builders is not so much overthrown as\r\nit is worn out. Their bows are broken, their fires burn low; and the\r\nsluggish, stolid sons of Montezuma creep at a petty pace “along the way\r\nto dusty death.” The inroads of warring bands are not fatal as their\r\nown system of communism. A closely-kept people must become effete;\r\nand marriage within the forbidden degrees, for ages on ages, produces\r\na diminutive, emasculate growth. In the tribes most isolated, where\r\nrace distinctions are sharply drawn, this blood degeneration is most\r\napparent. Very many are scrofulous, and albinos with pink eyes and\r\nwiry, white hair (strange sights!) are frequent among the Zunis and\r\nMoquis. Physicians tell us that it is a species of American leprosy,\r\nconsequent on the poverty of blood through lack of alien infusion.\r\n\r\nThe weakening of this most interesting nationality resembles the\r\nquiet decline of one stricken in years. As in the empire, so in the\r\nindividual; according to the predetermined doom it cannot last, another\r\nmust have its place. A peculiar people, utterly lacking in self\r\nassertion, through whole decades living in servitude under an enforced\r\nreligion, they have run their race, worked out their destiny, and in\r\nthe decrepitude of extreme old age, ruins and tribes, the dead and the\r\ndying, are crumbling away together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI. A FRONTIER IDYL.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur picnic was in the month of May and we started from Santa Fé in\r\nthe early morning. On three sides the drowsy old town is guarded by\r\nmountains royal with purple and glittering with gold. Thirty miles away\r\none snowy peak seemed an airy tent let down out of heaven, and across\r\nit the breeze blows as freshly as airs across Eden when the world was\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\nThe road wound beside the little river Santa Fé, whose waters go\r\nsoftly, after rippling down in icy cascades from a lake pure as Tahoe,\r\nformed by melting snows from the mountain top. Along its margin the\r\nred willow tosses its branches lightly as a lady’s plume, and back in\r\nthe hill country the pine-trees sigh to each other their never ceasing\r\nsong. Over the rocks clambering goats look down and shake their beards\r\nat the traveller, and the tinkle of a bell falls pleasantly on the ear\r\nas Mexican boys drive their flocks to the river; and where the sheep\r\nare drinking an Indian woman carrying a black jar on her head, erect\r\nand stately, comes to wash her poor rags in the stream.\r\n\r\nIt is all like the old Bible pictures. The somber landscape though\r\nsadly lacking color is serene and pastoral,--so filled with the beauty\r\nof peace and restful silence we thought of the ancient pilgrims\r\njourneying in the shining white light of the Delectable Mountains,\r\nand their talk with loving shepherds by the wayside. No fear of rain\r\nto spoil our pleasure; there will not be one drop, nor is there even\r\ndew. Yesterday we breathed balm and incense; to-morrow we know will be\r\njust like to-day. The south wind has “quieted the earth,” and the blue\r\noverhead is without spot of cloud, vapory mist or fog.\r\n\r\nOur party was quite large. In advance a well mounted Lieutenant, in\r\nthe glory of his first shoulder straps, rode close to the bridle rein\r\nof a young girl whose flying veil gave short glimpses of a beautiful\r\nface lighted with eyes of radiant hazel and the brightest smiles. They\r\nwere a pair of lovers, loved by us at first sight. In an ambulance\r\ncame a stout lady with color rather high than delicate, whose unhappy\r\nbonnet would not stick to her head but kept slipping down her back.\r\nBeside her sat a weak woman from Illinois, born tired and unable\r\nto find time to rest since that wearisome date, having barely life\r\nenough to be proud of her ten-year-old Rosa as though children were\r\nthe rarest things in the world. On a little _burro_, or donkey, was\r\na school teacher without special escort, but looked after by a dry\r\nold bachelor who had one romance in his life and still wore the\r\nminiature of a face, dearly loved and early lost, which has been only\r\ndust thirty years. For the old love’s sake he treated all women with\r\ndelicate reserve, seeing in them kinship to the lost ideal they in\r\nsome sort represent. A dream unbroken, for where death sets his seal\r\nthe imprint is eternal and endureth forever. Then there rode along a\r\nblonde and pensive artist, the author of many rejected manuscripts, who\r\ncarried sketching paper and a neat box of pencils. He wore his hair\r\nlong and boots small, smoked cigarettes incessantly, and eyed the gay\r\nLieutenant in bitterness of soul. Several light carriages whirled past\r\nus; and Brown, the photographer, dashed by on his own buckboard drawn\r\nby gallant gray mules. I had only time to notice the stranger beside\r\nhim had the blackest eyes and wore a diamond ring of unusual size and\r\nbrilliance which blazed in the sunlight as he courteously lifted his\r\nhat. Among the last to appear was an alumnus from Colorado College, who\r\nhad electrified the whole board of trustees with his graduating speech\r\nentitled, “The Centennial State--a Nation’s Benediction.” This callow\r\nyouth had made the eastern tour, had a nodding acquaintance with the\r\ncrowned heads of Boston, and in conscious superiority overshadowed his\r\ncompanion, the Baptist minister, one of the meekest spirits that ever\r\nstarved its way to heaven.\r\n\r\nThe army ambulance moved slowly through the sandy red soil but we\r\ndid not care; the mountains--how grand they are!--were a perpetual\r\ndelight. The fineness of the atmosphere gave exquisite tints to the\r\nnear foothills and the vast horizon. Clusters of wild verbenas purpled\r\nthe plain--a deeper shade of the far away hill purples--and strange\r\nflowers, yellow and pink, nestled in the short, moss-like grass. They\r\nnever felt dew or rain, yet they did not appear stunted or starved, but\r\nlooked up brightly in the sterile sand as from a garden bed.\r\n\r\nNow and then a Pueblo Indian strode silently across our way, and a\r\nMexican in picturesque striped blanket saluted us in Spanish fashion\r\nwith a “_Buenos dias señoras_,” as he drove his cruelly loaded donkey\r\ntoward the city. Lazy Mexicans squatted in rows, sunned themselves\r\nagainst the low walls of their houses; and on a chimney a flock of\r\npigeons tamely perched, and watched the movements of a mower cutting\r\nthe grass which grew scantily on the flat mud roof of his miserable hut.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the chosen ground a fire was already kindled from the\r\nresinous boughs of the _piñon_, and lovers were straying off in shady\r\nplaces to find out what words the daisies are saying to youth and\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nBrown, the photographer, introduced his guest, a fine old Spaniard\r\nnamed Oreto. He wore the easy air of a man familiar with good society,\r\nand the lofty courtesy which marks the true Castilian, I may say the\r\ntrue gentleman, anywhere. He claimed to be hidalgo--literally, son of\r\na Goth--by which is meant pure Catholic Spanish blood, without a taint\r\nof Jew or Moor; was educated at Salamanca, and by training conservative\r\nwas quick to denounce Castelar and his politics as highly pernicious.\r\nIn a quiet way he was a great talker; the flashing eyes alone betrayed\r\nthe intensity of his feeling, and as no one entered into debate with\r\nhim, he fell to extolling the glory of old Castile. Gradually the whole\r\nparty was attracted to him, and he became the centre of a circle of\r\ninterested listeners.\r\n\r\nThe fair rider with fluffy curls blown by the mountain breeze against\r\nthe arm she leaned on, bent forward and asked, “Why leave your own\r\ncountry for this wild New World?”\r\n\r\n“It is long to tell the state troubles which drove me from home and\r\nmade me a wanderer, for out of Spain every land is exile; too long for\r\neven a summer day.”\r\n\r\n“But not too long for our interest,” she answered with a charming\r\nanimation; “you are alone in life,” she added with a glance at the band\r\nof mourning crape on his _sombrero_.\r\n\r\n“Catalina and my niñita are with the saints,”--he crossed his breast\r\nreverently. “When I laid them in the vault at Valladolid my heart felt\r\nheavy and cold. I thought the long voyage and sight of new places might\r\nwarm it, and I might find some diversion, or as our neighbors over the\r\nPyrenees say ‘distraction,’ by imitating my ancient countryman in a\r\nchase after ‘the fountain of youth.’”\r\n\r\n“That is in our own hearts,” said Romeo, with an arch glance at Juliet.\r\n\r\n“Yes, so experience teaches. I am last of my name and house, and”--his\r\nvoice sunk mournfully--“I had buried the wife of my youth, whom I loved\r\nwith a great love, after we had lived together twenty years.”\r\n\r\nHe sighed and turned his eyes toward the mountain-top shining like\r\nsilver in the keen, clear light, and the artist fell to sketching\r\nOreto’s profile.\r\n\r\n“Time is the great consoler,” said the languid Illinoisian, trying to\r\nadapt her harsh English to the spoken music of the stranger. A southern\r\nsky makes a gentle voice, and the Spanish tongue has a matchless trick\r\nof melting all it touches into a melody.\r\n\r\n“_La Señora_ is most kind, but it is too late; the heart has no second\r\nspring. Do you see the white line down the mountain-side?” he asked,\r\nabruptly changing the subject evidently painful to dwell upon.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is a brook rising in a spring, cold as ice, clear as glass.”\r\n\r\n“Then, instead of my dull, sad story let me tell you the tradition of\r\nthe Blue Fountain, the name of the spring,--_Fontaine-bleu_, as the\r\nFrench Fathers used to call it.”\r\n\r\n“By all means; a story, a story!” the ladies cried in chorus.\r\n\r\n“You do me proud,” said Oreto with a sweeping bow, “and since you\r\nhonor me with your attention I promise not to weary it.”\r\n\r\nWe disposed ourselves in various attitudes about the speaker. The\r\nrising generation gathered in graceful groups under the stunted pines,\r\nand the setting generation sat on buffalo robes and cushions against\r\nthe gnarled and twisted trunks of the _piñones_. Little Rosa was coaxed\r\nto her mother’s lap, and the stout lady reclined on the back seat of\r\nthe ambulance, loosened her bonnet strings and made herself extremely\r\ncomfortable while we listened to the\r\n\r\n  LEGEND OF THE BLUE FOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\n“Once upon a time,” the Spaniard began, with his grave smile, “away to\r\nthe North in the country you call Montana lived a young Indian hunter,\r\ntall and straight and very handsome. From boyhood he had heard stories\r\nof happy hunting-grounds where the _pasturas_ were always fresh and\r\ngame was always in sight. So one bitter cold morning he put on his\r\nsnow-shoes and fur mittens, wrapped himself in his warmest bearskin,\r\nand struck southward, following the stony mountain ranges till he\r\nreached this lonesome region.”\r\n\r\n“Did he travel all alone?” asked little Rosa.\r\n\r\n“Only the travelling winds went with him. But he did not know what fear\r\nis, though at night he heard the coyote’s cry, the bellowing of the\r\nbison and the howl of the prairie wolf. The sun, which he worshipped,\r\nshone friendly all the way; gradually the breeze blew softer, the earth\r\ngrew warmer and greener. After one long day’s march he drank deep of\r\nthe spring in yon hillside, laid his bent bow and quiver of arrows on\r\nthe rock, and went to sleep in the soft warm sand by the Blue Fountain.\r\n\r\n“An Indian warrior sleeps lightly, and in his slumber appeared a\r\nform--a woman’s, such a shape as is seen nowhere but in dreams and\r\nAndalusia.” The stranger paused and looked dreamily on the ground\r\nlike one busy with memory, and in sympathy I thought of the lost\r\nCatalina and the little one lying in the gloomy vault of Valladolid. We\r\nrespected his silence, and after a moment he continued:\r\n\r\n“The spirit spoke to the dreamer in words of infinite tenderness, and\r\nappeared to watch and guard him. On waking he took a long draught of\r\nthe cool snow water, and gazed searchingly into its blue depths.”\r\n\r\n“Was it really blue?” broke in Rosa.\r\n\r\n“Sky blue and silver,” said the Castilian, adding one of the endearing\r\ndiminutives in which his language is so rich and which I did not quite\r\ncomprehend. “Many times he tried to catch a glance of the fairy face\r\nwhich came into his sleep, making it better than any waking. Long he\r\ngazed into the watery mirror; it reflected only his own tawny face and\r\nthe spotless sky above it. The white sand boiled from unknown depths\r\nbelow, bubbles came to the top and broke on the stony brim, but the\r\nceaseless gush and flow of the waters was a chime in his ears without\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\n“He lingered about this spot, so runs the tale, many weeks, praying\r\nfor the appearance of the water maiden. She came into his sleep but\r\nnever blest his waking eyes, and when the rainy season, which is so\r\nvery dreary, set in, the disappointed youth went back to his tribe.\r\nThe vision haunted him; in vain he tried to shake it off; the _vega_,\r\nso lone, so dim, so untrodden, was filled with strange enchantment.\r\nThe brook went flowing through his memory, glancing now in sun, now in\r\nshadow, as it gushed from the mountain side, vanishing at last like\r\nfairy gold in the sand. The laughing girls of the tribe tried to rouse\r\nhim from indifference, but could not stir him to join in their songs\r\nand games. In the time of the corn harvest the present of a blood-red\r\near, the Indian’s _rose d’amour_, did not move him to any feeling, and\r\nhe turned with glance averted from the flying feet in the bewitching\r\n_cachina_ dance.\r\n\r\n“‘He is moonstruck,’ said the girls; ‘give him the crooked ear, for the\r\nfool is fit for nothing but to sit in the sun with the very old men.’”\r\nHe heeded neither jest nor laugh, and determined to come back to the\r\nBlue Fountain. When he set out an airy figure seemed to go before and\r\nbeckon him on, as the swan maidens of the German lakes beckon young\r\nknights into their little boats drawn by snowy swans harnessed with\r\nsilver chains.\r\n\r\n“Southward, southward he strode, following the ancient march of\r\nAzatlan, and, in sight of the beloved spring, he climbed the steep,\r\nfleet and untired as the red deer, to find the same sparkling fountain,\r\nand the shining brook below it running into the valley as it will run\r\non forever.\r\n\r\n“Again he lay down on the soft, warm sand, and once more the delicate\r\nphantom appeared to his closed eyes, whispered gently in his ear, and\r\nbent above his head as if to kiss him.”\r\n\r\nHere the lovers “changed eyes,” leaned a trifle closer together, and I\r\nsaw Romeo pick up a blue ribbon dropped from Juliet’s sleeve and slip\r\nit into his watch pocket.\r\n\r\n“Then a frantic love took possession of the hunter. Day after day,\r\nnight after night, his wasting form was laid beside the singing\r\ncascade; ever he sighed, murmured, dreamed. The strength left his\r\nlimbs, his blood beat hotly: summer waned and cold winds blew, but\r\nnever cooled the fever of his brow. Sometimes after a day’s hunt,\r\nreturning at evening he fancied he saw a misty outline against the\r\ndark steep, but it melted away as he neared it and instead of a living\r\nwoman he reached out to clasp the empty air. Then the warrior began\r\nto understand this water spirit was of the race of Souls, and as such\r\ncould not wed a mortal; to possess her, therefore, he must be like\r\nher--must die. So one day when the world was all bright and his soul\r\nall dark, while she sung a song of wonderful music he stretched his\r\narms to reach the shadowy siren and plunged from the black ledge you\r\nsee yonder into the unknown depths below.”\r\n\r\n“And was he never heard of afterward?” asked Juliet, while the roses on\r\nher cheek deepened in betrayal of her thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Never, _hermosura_,” said the Spaniard with an admiring gesture, “but\r\nold Pueblos about here say two shapes rise out of the spring where\r\nthere used to be but one, float in the air and hover above it. They are\r\noftenest seen about dusk in the rainy season. I have never seen them\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if they do show that way,” said Rosa with a puzzled face.\r\n\r\n“_Quien sabe_,” said Oreto mysteriously, at the same time handing her\r\nthe kernel of a _piñon_ nut which he cracked in his white front teeth.\r\n\r\nAnd here let me record that the words “_Quien sabe_,” “who knows,”\r\nare the end of controversy, the finish of debate, the limit of human\r\nunderstanding, having a very different meaning according to the persons\r\nspeaking. With Oreto it was as much as to say, there is room for\r\nargument on both sides.\r\n\r\nAll this time our stew had been simmering, gypsy fashion, over the\r\nfire, keeping a friendly and impatient knocking at the pot lid, and\r\nwas now pronounced done. The stout lady roused up from her nap, set her\r\nbonnet bias across her eyebrows, said she was glad the young Comanche\r\ncame to his senses at last, and then addressed herself to the making of\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\nI met Oreto frequently, and never saw him unbend from the Hamlet\r\nair--“Man delights not me, no, nor woman either,”--except on this one\r\nholiday. So to speak, he flavored the whole picnic. He gayly insisted\r\non seasoning every dish. “I will not ruin the _olla_ for Americans,\r\nwith too much red pepper,” he said; “the merest _soupçon_, as the\r\nFrench put it.” Then he contrived a nice, cool-looking salad from some\r\ncrisp leaves, to me unknown, and served it with a deftness and tact\r\nthat would have graced a courtier. To tell the whole truth, the elegant\r\nCastilian had so much manner it was rather fatiguing to keep up with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nDinner over, he took a large silk handkerchief and showed how two\r\nprisoners of the Inquisition were once knotted together with ropes,\r\nand allowed their freedom if they could untie them, trying the puzzle\r\non the lovers, who, of course, struggled violently to be free,--I need\r\nhardly add without success. Had he experimented on some of the married\r\ncouples possibly the result might have been different. Following this\r\nwas a gay barcarole about strolling on the Prado, glancing eyes, winged\r\nfeet and envious veils. “It should have castanets in the chorus; if\r\nSeñor Brown will lend me his hat it will answer.”\r\n\r\nThus appealed to, the photographer could not choose but offer his brand\r\nnew stovepipe to his guest, who thumped it vigorously, greatly to\r\nSeñor Brown’s annoyance, who stood looking foolish, bareheaded in the\r\nsunshine. And again I marked the size and lustre of the diamond ring.\r\n\r\nThe singer’s voice was a trifle cracked, but we were not fastidious,\r\nthe ladies hung on every word, and when the song ended, the applause\r\nwas hearty and genuine. The blonde artist produced a flute which\r\nluckily for us had a missing joint, and insinuated he could be\r\nprevailed upon to sing; but we knew “The Raven” would be his doleful\r\nstrain and upon the hint no one spoke.\r\n\r\n“Now a thousand pardons,” said Oreto, “for consuming your time and\r\ncourtesy. I must have a _siesta_, without which you know a Spaniard\r\nis lost forever and a day.” From under the seat of the buckboard\r\nhe unrolled a short cloak and threw it in Moorish style across his\r\nshoulders, lifted his _sombrero_, revealing a nobly turned head with\r\ndashes of gray in the blue-black hair, and his face resumed its\r\nexpression of habitual melancholy. As he walked off to the shadow of a\r\ngreat rock the alumnus from Colorado college, who knows it all, said\r\nin a loud whisper, “There goes Don Pomposo. He feels like the Corliss\r\nengine at the Centennial.”\r\n\r\nThe old bachelor shot the fledgling a glance that should have killed\r\nhim, but the youth, though poor by nature and exhausted by cultivation,\r\nwas wiry and did not fall asunder. In fact he never flinched. My\r\nthoughts wandered from the gay company and the man who had no respect\r\nfor “the stranger within the gates,” to the lone exile and the varied\r\nfortunes at which he had hinted, and I said aloud, “The Señor Oreto\r\nlooks like a man who has a history.”\r\n\r\nAnd he has.\r\n\r\nI dismiss the picnic in the brilliant periods of the Pharos of the\r\nOccident. The editor-in-chief, being also an insurance agent, naturally\r\ndealt in large figures, and gave free rein to his warm, not to say\r\nfiery imagination: “The picnic of last week was an event long to be\r\nremembered. The day was beautiful, nature enchanting, woman divine.\r\nOld Baldy lifted his rugged front and snowy crown before us, and the\r\nriver sung its sweetest cadence. Among distinguished guests present we\r\nname the fascinating Gonzalez Felipe Oreto, a cosmopolitan born in old\r\nCastile, the friend of our artist, James Brown. For æsthetic culture,\r\nrefinement of manner and general elegance the versatile Castilian has\r\nfew equals and no superiors. Rumor has it he will soon lead to the\r\naltar a fair widow well known to our city, and we learn with extreme\r\npleasure that he has been prevailed on to cast in his lot with us and\r\nbecome a citizen of the most desirable of all the territories.”\r\n\r\nFrom this time the popularity of the delightful Gonzalez Felipe Oreto\r\nsteadily increased. The young ladies gazed at him with undisguised\r\nadmiration, the mothers smiled on him, but his attentions were too\r\nevenly distributed to indicate the least preference. One day he dashed\r\nall hopes by publishing in the _Pharos of the Occident_ the poem\r\ngiven below. He told his landlady, in the deepest confidence, it was\r\naddressed to a noble lady of Valencia, who had deigned to give him a\r\nsweet souvenir in return for his verses and present.\r\n\r\nMy reader need hardly be told it was all over town before night--that\r\npretty secret of Oreto’s.\r\n\r\n  TO ISABELLA RASCON--WITH A SHELL.\r\n\r\n  The years have brought you many gifts\r\n    Since first you heard them tell\r\n  How the voice of the sea is hid\r\n    In the windings of a shell.\r\n  And where’er it may be exiled,\r\n    From its own warm Eastern main,\r\n  Bend your ear to the crystal cell,\r\n    And you hear the sea again.\r\n\r\n  I list to the murmurous sound\r\n    But it never shapes one word.\r\n  I cannot guess what it would tell,\r\n    That echo always heard.\r\n  Does it speak of the strange, rich life\r\n    Far down in the surging waves,\r\n  Where purple mullet and gold fish rove\r\n    The depths of coral caves?\r\n\r\n  Where Ocean’s throbbing heart is stilled,\r\n    And wandering Peri’s rest,\r\n  ’Mid the pearl and amber jewels\r\n    He loves to wear in his breast?\r\n  Perchance the mellow strain was caught\r\n    From the song of mermaid fair,\r\n  Dreamily chanting, as she smoothed\r\n    The rings of her long, wet hair.\r\n\r\n  Or, lingering yet, the echo faint\r\n    Of a life once held within.\r\n  Some hidden shape that breathed and died\r\n    Afar from the breakers din.\r\n  Never had Sultan roof like this,\r\n    Never king such castle wall,\r\n  What was it wrought this wondrous dome\r\n    And filled this crystal hall?\r\n\r\n  Deserted now, but whispering low\r\n    The secret hid in the sea.\r\n  Ask what the mystic music means,\r\n    And it answers, ceaselessly,\r\n  With that weird song,--tender and low\r\n    As the voice of brooding dove\r\n  Who murmurs but a single note,\r\n    Keynote of life--it is Love.\r\n\r\n  Ah, when you hear that pleading sound,\r\n    Dream not of siren or sea.\r\n  Believe it the spirit of Love,\r\n    Forever singing--of me.\r\n\r\nSome weeks after the picnic I sat working a highly useless lamp mat in\r\nmy parlor, which in pleasant Mexican fashion is divided from the office\r\nby a curtained doorway. There passed the barred window a dapper little\r\nman, whipping his boot with a short riding whip as he went along,\r\nwhom I recognized as a government agent from Los Indios. I heeded not\r\nthe conversation, easily overheard, or rather the monologue which\r\nlanguished, till a sudden animation of voice betrayed the true purpose\r\nof the visitor as he asked, “Was there a fellow hangin’ ‘round here not\r\nlong ago, calling himself Oreto; a sort of literary and sentimental\r\nadventurer, pretending to be in heavy mourning?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he had quite a turn for story telling and amusing children. The\r\n_caballero_ appears to have fallen on evil times--a sad face, wouldn’t\r\nbe a bad model for the Master of Ravenswood.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly; his face is mighty sad about this time. Interested friends\r\nhave taken secure boarding for him and relieved him of his wig and\r\nbig diamond ring--the property of a lady in Zuloago. His real name is\r\nGomez, a gambler and murderer from the city of Mexico. He ran off to\r\nChihuahua, which soon got too hot to hold him and his little games,\r\nmoved on to Los Indios, where he played three card montè once too often\r\nfor even territorial morality, and the noble _hidalgo_ is now smiling\r\nhis melancholy smile behind the grated windows of the county jail.”\r\n\r\n“He had rather an agreeable manner,” said the listener with a long\r\nyawn, “but I never took much stock in the man.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII. THE PIMOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe minds of men untrained are strangely alike. There is such sameness\r\nof arts, customs, inventions, such likeness in their religious beliefs\r\nunder like stages of development, we must reach the conclusions that\r\non subjects of deep human interest certain ideas are inherent in\r\nhuman hearts, despite alien blood and long epochs of separation. All\r\nbarbarians have their priests or medicine men and prophets, are firm\r\nbelievers in necromancy, incantations, the power of witchcraft, and\r\nhave deep faith in the great Spirit as the peculiar guardian of their\r\nrace. Some tribes have a fear of the devil who must be worshipped\r\nin order to be propitiated. With them old times are best, and all\r\ntraditions run back to a golden age of innocency in a Region of Delight\r\nwhere the rivers sparkled with sweet water, the maize was always\r\nripe, and high born warriors revelled and feasted on the game ever in\r\nsight. There was no work, no disease, no old age. This Elysium was\r\nlost by crime, and the Arcadian days ended forever. The sinful world\r\nwas destroyed by a Flood from which only one prophet and his family\r\nescaped. Every Rocky Mountain tribe has its legend of the deluge and\r\nbelief in the second coming of the Divine Man who is to right all\r\nwrongs, correct all miseries and mistakes; returning some bright\r\nmorning to renew the dull world to youth, and then Paradise will be\r\nregained. For this revelation they wait, as the prophetic souls were\r\nfound waiting to be guided by the star which led to the divine child of\r\nMary.\r\n\r\nThe Pueblos jealously guard their wretched little chapels (_estufas_)\r\nfrom the prying eyes of strangers, and the gentlest of visitors is\r\nrebuffed by their dumb secrecy. In different ways I have gathered many\r\ntraditions. Some are childish and witless to my understanding; others\r\nwearing symbolic veils are graceful as the Greek myths, and hold a\r\nsignificance as rich. Fables of the nomads will do for another day. The\r\nPueblos take our attention first. The great variety of climate in North\r\nAmerica produces various habits of life which temper and color the\r\nfables; and I believe there is no myth without some meaning. The vapory\r\nconceits we treat so lightly were not empty phantasms to the brain that\r\nshaped them in the beginning, and some heart has thrilled to each airy,\r\ninsubstantial legend.\r\n\r\nCertain old instincts run in all bloods. The inborn desire of the\r\nsoul to account for its origin, to ask whence come I, what am I,\r\nperplexes the bewildered savage burrowing in his cave as it did the\r\nlearned questioners, a mixed multitude crowding the Academy, reverently\r\nlistening to the wondrous maid of Alexandria--Hypatia the Beautiful.\r\n\r\nWhat is truth? asked the Governor of Judea as truth Incarnate stood\r\nbefore him in the Judgment Hall; and men are yet demanding of science,\r\nnature, philosophy, the origin of being, the destinies, the soul and\r\nits limitations. Turning from the seen to the unseen, from the outer to\r\nthe inner life, from the tangible to the unreal, longing to know the\r\nbeginning and the end of all. It is the old yearning to be as God; old\r\nas the first man. To comprehend the stirring of the divinity within,\r\nwhich neither feeds nor sleeps but lives on separate from the body,\r\nopens endless questioning. This is the study of sages; about it the\r\nwisest debate and ponder, and of it the savage, blanketless and naked,\r\nwhere the soft seasons allow him to roam, asks with a blind ignorance\r\ninfinitely pathetic.\r\n\r\nTo him the hidden forces which rule the universe are divinities to\r\nbe entreated by prayer, propitiated by sacrifice and offerings. The\r\nsavage’s whole life is penetrated by religion, from the hard little\r\ncradle to which he is swathed, to the shallow pit where he lies\r\nuncoffined when life’s struggle is over.\r\n\r\nThe tribes near Santa Fé and the larger American towns of New Mexico\r\nhave mixed the religion of Christ with the old superstitions in a\r\ncurious, almost painful manner. I once visited Tesuque with a view\r\nto gaining some knowledge of their primitive ceremonials. The usual\r\nprotracted smoking was indulged in; there followed a stupid meaningless\r\nsilence, considered the height of politeness; then we partook of\r\ncold refreshments consisting of little apples carefully wiped on the\r\nsheepskin which covered baby’s cradle as a blanket. We climbed the\r\nrickety ladders, admired the excellence of the bearskins, counted the\r\nbags of shelled corn and rough potteries baked in their mud furnaces,\r\nsurveyed a chromo in feverish colors named the Queen of Heaven, and\r\nwhen the time was ripe I modestly inquired if we might be permitted to\r\nvisit the _estufa_. The head man of the tribe (cacique) whom we named\r\nHiawatha, smiled blandly, showing ivory white teeth without a flaw,\r\nand said “Si, Sigñora,” with a cheerful alacrity quite foreign to the\r\nusual aboriginal stoicism. We followed him into the courtyard and\r\nMinnehaha followed us and stonily stared. The dusky maiden in the march\r\nof progress is escaping from buckskin draperies. She wears the garment\r\ncalled by the French _intimate_, skirt of Navajo blanket, black ground\r\nwith tracings of red embroidery, not unlike the familiar Greek pattern,\r\ncalico shawl gay as the scarf of Iris. She is without beauty of any\r\nsort; is raw boned and high shouldered, inclining to fat; of an ashy\r\nsunburnt skin, flat face, high cheek bones, thick lips, mannish gait,\r\nharsh voice. She is nearly akin (if there’s anything in likeness) to\r\nthe Mongolian Ah Sin, and to ward off the sun that day carried a yellow\r\nparasol over her heavy head. They all stared unmoved as we climbed a\r\nladder leaning against the side of a high pen made of pine logs and\r\nmud plaster,--a roofless enclosure perhaps eighteen feet square. As we\r\nlooked down, a number of birds like swallows flew out, and save their\r\nmud-built nests against the logs the ancient _estufa_ was empty. The\r\nold arrow-maker was joking when he conducted us to the altar place;\r\nthe shrine was abandoned, the sacred fire was dead, the secret temple\r\nwith all its holy and guarded mysteries was laid open to women even!\r\nIt was plain the Queen of Heaven had usurped the place of the lord of\r\nlife and light. The chief smiled broadly and Minnehaha wrapped the pink\r\ncalico rebosa round her head and laughed as if she would die. I hate\r\nto be beaten in this way, and while the gentlemen went off to look\r\nat a bear skin, I approached the youthful princess in the attitude\r\nof interviewer. “Gentle maiden,” I said, mustering my small stock\r\nof Spanish, “do you remember when the Montezuma fire burned in this\r\ndeserted _estufa_?”\r\n\r\n“Si, Sigñora.”\r\n\r\n“Was it many years ago?”\r\n\r\n“Si, sigñora.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps fifteen years?” (insinuatingly).\r\n\r\n“Si, sigñora.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, can you remember so long? What sort of wood was consecrated to the\r\nshrine?”\r\n\r\n“Si, sigñora.”\r\n\r\n“Did it flame up to the roof, or was it merely a bank of coals; your\r\nmother” (tenderly) “has told you of it I know.”\r\n\r\n“Si, sigñora.”\r\n\r\n“Then tell me all you know, if it will not trouble you too much, and I\r\npromise you a beautiful string of blue beads.”\r\n\r\n“Si, sigñora.”\r\n\r\nThis intellectual feast was broken up by an untimely giggle from a\r\ngentle maiden not of aboriginal blood, and we made our adieux. I\r\nafterward learned the sweet girl was only shamming; she understood\r\nSpanish well enough, but chose this pretense to outwit strangers. A\r\ndistinguished success.\r\n\r\nWe were completely floored and made haste to cover our retreat by\r\nleaving the mud-walled village for a nooning and lunch under a\r\nclump of gnarled cedars hard by. The Indian is not disappearing at\r\na satisfactory rate before the march of civilization. A swarm of\r\nchildren, the dirtiest and raggedest imaginable, followed us and\r\nheld out their hands for the remains of our lunch. The biscuits were\r\nsnatched by a youthful Indigene like the greedy boy of the First Reader\r\nwho refused to give his dear playmates a crumb of his cake, and I had\r\nto fairly slap his hands to make him divide. He then swallowed the\r\nlemon rinds and would have devoured the sardine boxes if he could. So\r\nmuch alike are the sons of men!\r\n\r\nTo reach the old superstitions in their purity we must push away from\r\nthe track of the locomotive; far as possible from censer and cross,\r\nparish priest and Protestant missionary. So we set out with the\r\ndetermination of the mythic Roton, who resolved to go till he arrived\r\nat the roof of heaven; away to the Moquis of the North and the Papagos\r\nof the South. Below the Gila dwell in close neighborhood the Maricopas\r\nand the Pimos, or as the old Spaniards wrote it Pimas, whom they found\r\nthree hundred years ago irrigating the lands and raising two crops of\r\ncorn a year, just as they do now. The Coco-Maricopas are a branch of\r\nthe Pueblos, and these tribes inhabit a large region, mostly perfect\r\ndesert, between the head of the Gulf of California and that extensive\r\ncordillera of which the Sierra Catalina forms the most westerly range.\r\nA volcanic country in which since the introduction of man, the surface\r\nof the earth as well as the climate has undergone great changes.\r\n\r\nAfter straining over scorching deserts, alkali plains, sage bush and\r\ngreasewood wastes, it was a deep pleasure to rest our tired eyes on\r\nthe bright corn lands on both sides of the river Gila, which runs\r\nthrough the Pimo reservation about twenty-five miles. The three great\r\n_acequias_ with their various branches comprise nearly five hundred\r\nmiles, and extend over a tract of land eighteen miles in length. The\r\nfields are fenced with crooked sticks, wattled with brush, mainly\r\nof the thorny cactus and mezquit. The Salic or rather Slavic law\r\nprevails among the aborigines. Instead of studying graceful culture and\r\ndecorative art, the farming is done by the women. When harvest time\r\ncomes, the men turn into the fields and help, besides lightening the\r\nlabor by standing around in the shade and looking on, or sprawling on\r\nthe floor swinging the baby as it hangs suspended in a box, hanging by\r\na cord from the ceiling. Sometimes the mother carries a large basket\r\non her head and the papoose sitting on a sort of side-bustle astride\r\nher hip. A civilized baby would tumble off instantly, but the native\r\ninfant holds on to her smooth, shining sides in an attitude wonderfully\r\nlike the missing link, our Simian ancestor, riding the calico pony in\r\ngay circus ring. This baby does not cut monkey-shines, but stares at\r\nthe stranger as stolidly as his father and mother. The Pimo customs are\r\nlike the Coco-Maricopas in everything but burial rites. They bury their\r\ndead but their neighbors burn them. The Maricopa bodies are placed on a\r\nfuneral pyre of resinous wood and utterly consumed, in classic fashion.\r\n\r\nReporters say the mourners go into a profound mourning of tar. On\r\ninquiry I learned the “tar” is a portion of the ashes of the dear\r\ndeceased mixed with the dissolved gum of the mezquit, (a species of\r\nacacia which yields a concrete juice like gum arabic). They smear their\r\nfaces with the hideous plaster, and let it remain as a mark of deep\r\ngrief till it wears away. A widow, the next day after her bereavement,\r\nis offered in market by the town crier to any one who wants a wife. If\r\nan able-bodied squaw, good at hoeing, and stout enough to balance the\r\nbaby on top of the basket of corn overhead, she is usually courted,\r\n“wooed, won, married and all” within a few days, though custom allows\r\nher to continue the periodic howling and tar deep-mourning several days\r\nafter the new honeymoon begins to shine.\r\n\r\nI was charmed at thought of being among Pagans assisting at such\r\nheathen obsequies, and felt it the spot to find the ancient lore I\r\nsought, through many a weary mile of lava bed and tropic scorch. I\r\nwas among the changeless, unimpressible American Indians, living\r\namong demons and goblins, spirits of earth, air, fire, water, whose\r\nbeliefs are untainted by mixture of Christian ideas. Here I discovered\r\nthe flickering, mythic lights which produce such lovely effects,\r\nchanging gods to men, and making demigods of heroes. Among these\r\nuntutored children of nature, every misty outline and vapory mountain\r\nhaze might be an aboriginal soul floated out into the unknown dark\r\non its wanderings toward the bright sun house. In the shadows of\r\nvast cañons the block elves have their haunts, and lie in wait for\r\nbewildered spirits, and hurl spectral missiles along the pathless\r\nspace surrounding “the dance house of the ghosts.” The Pueblos are all\r\nsun-worshippers, and the Pimos tell us the road to the sun house is\r\nbeset with perils. In the darkness of the dread mystery of death, deep\r\nwaters are to be crossed, many-headed monsters bellow and roar, fire\r\nflames before the eyes, and whirlwinds lift the affrighted spirit from\r\nhis feet and toss him in mid air. Four is a sacred number with them,\r\nderived from adoration of the four cardinal points; the soul flutters\r\nabout the body four days, and sometimes stones are thrown across the\r\nwarrior’s grave to scare away the evil spirits. In the unlighted valley\r\nthe brave must be provided with a pipe for his solace, with weapons\r\nsuited to his rank, choice armor approved to fit him as he enters the\r\nkingdom of souls. Lifeless, he may yet grope through the cold clay,\r\nand touching with icy fingers the trusted arms, will not tremble in\r\ndefenceless march through the horror of the awful shades.\r\n\r\nIs this not the instinct of the antique Scythian buried on the field\r\nwith the blade in which victory still lingers? The pathos of the singer\r\nbreaking his heart and harp together:\r\n\r\n  “Lay his sword by his side, it hath served him too well\r\n    Not to rest near his pillow below;\r\n  To the last moment true, from his hand ere it fell\r\n    Its point was still turned to a flying foe.\r\n  Fellow-lab’rers in life, let them slumber in death,\r\n    Side by side, as becomes the reposing brave,--\r\n  That sword which he loved still unbroke in its sheath,\r\n    And himself unsubdued in his grave.”\r\n\r\nFour days the howlers howl, and further to cheer the dread passage\r\nfour nights a fire is kindled on the warrior’s grave to open a path\r\nfor the blinded footsteps in the fearful “dead man’s journey,” and\r\nlead them to the sun, the safe, final resting place. There the chief\r\nwill take up his weapons again and spend a blissful eternity fighting\r\nhis old enemies, the Yumas, and we may be sure slaying his thousands\r\nand revelling in blood, like the Viking in the halls of the Valhalla,\r\nwith his comrades hacked to pieces in many a morning fight, but always\r\nready with whole limbs and flashing, undinted armor, to appear at\r\ndinner. Food is placed on the fresh earth, the best corn bread, flesh\r\nof antelope and jars of water, that the lone one may be comforted by\r\ngifts from the world he has left. These tender offerings bestowed, the\r\nproperty of the hero is portioned out to the tribe, fields divided\r\namong those who need land, his grain, chickens, dogs, bows, etc.,\r\nfairly distributed. No wrangling among heirs, no lawyers to absorb\r\nestates, all is done fairly and equitably, in a submission to precedent\r\nworthy our imitation.\r\n\r\nNor do the Pimos refuse to be comforted. Cattle are driven up and\r\nslaughtered, and deeply burdened with sorrow, every man loads down his\r\nsquaw with beef, and feasts whole days on funeral baked meats. Dare I\r\ndisgust my dear friend, the classic reader, by saying these barbarian\r\nfeasts are reminders of the tremendous banquet in the pavilion of\r\nAgamemnon, where the “steer of full five years” was killed, skinned,\r\nand cooked before the eyes of the Grecians.\r\n\r\nHomeric champions--Trojan peers and sceptered kings of Greece--were not\r\nmade wretched by indigestion, and I suspect (low be it spoken!) they\r\ntook pepsin in the natural state. With their enviable appetites they\r\nwere ready to eat off-hand; the squarest of meals never came amiss, and\r\ntheir capacity for tough beef, rare done, was prodigious and unfailing.\r\nSo far very like our Rocky mountaineers, but unhappily the red warriors\r\nare not embalmed in verse by the imperishable poets.\r\n\r\nWhen the Indian woman dies no high sepulchral feasts, no games and\r\nhonors, such as Ilion to her hero paid. With scant ceremony she is\r\nwrapped in her poor shroud, the moccasins of her own make fastened to\r\nher shapely feet; the carrying-strap worn across the forehead, and the\r\npaddle go with the cold hands. Sad emblem of woman’s destiny in the\r\nwilderness; pathetic tokens that even in the mystic land of shades she\r\nmust be the silent, uncomplaining slave of her brutish, savage lord.\r\n\r\nThis is the Pimo legend of the Creation: The world was made by an\r\nearth prophet. In the beginning it stretched fair and frail as a line\r\nof light across the darkness of empty space. A wise Sagamore lived\r\nin the Gila valley, and one night a royal eagle came to the door and\r\nwarned him of a deluge close at hand. The prophet wrapped his mantle\r\nof fur around him, for it was winter, and laughed the gray messenger\r\nto scorn. The kingly bird shook his white head, spread wide his wings\r\nand soared away to heaven. Again the eagle came with his warning cry,\r\nthe waters were near and would soon burst overhead; but the sachem\r\ndrowsily groaned at the wakening voice and turned on his bed of buffalo\r\nskins and slept. Three times the broad wings shadowed the sleeper, and\r\nthe friendly voice entreated him to flee the wrath of the gods, but\r\nthe prophet gave no heed. Then quick as the eagle disappeared in the\r\nblue and starry silence, there came thunder, lightning, and a mountain\r\nof water like an earthquake overspread the valley of Gila, and the\r\nmorning sun shone on only one man saved from destruction by floating\r\non a ball of resin--Szeukha, the son of the Creator. He was enraged at\r\nthe royal bird, thinking him the mover of the flood, and made a rope\r\nladder of tough bark like the woodbine, climbed the naked, riven cliff\r\nwhere the eagle lived, and slew him. He then raised to life the mangled\r\nbodies of the slain on which the eagle had preyed, and sent them out to\r\nre-people the world. In the centre of the vast eyrie he found a woman,\r\nthe eagle’s wife, and their child. These he helped down the rope ladder\r\nand sent on their way, and from them are descended that race of wise\r\nmen called Hohocam, ancients or grandfathers, who were guided in all\r\ntheir wanderings by an eagle. Southward they marched past forests of\r\noak, sycamore, cedar and flowering trees, past mountains of crystal and\r\ngold, and rivers murmurous with song flowing over beds of stars, till\r\nthey reached a deep blue lake kissed by soft winds, sparkling in the\r\nsunlight. On its borders they planted a city with streets of water--old\r\nTenochtitlan, which white men call Mexico. Through the uncounted\r\ncenturies since the deluge, Szeukha has not dropped out of Indian\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nBecause he killed the bird of prophecy he had to do a sort of penance,\r\nwhich was never to scratch himself with his nails but always with a\r\nlittle stick. The custom is still adhered to by the unchanging Pimos,\r\nand a splinter of wood, renewed every fourth day, is carried for this\r\npurpose, stuck in their long coarse hair and plied with extreme energy\r\nand enjoyment. Stern are the duties of the historian, and truth obliges\r\nme to record the Pimos do not scratch their heads for nothing.\r\n\r\nThey are good fighters, and have been a wall of defence against the\r\nincursions of Apaches, at one time the only protection for travellers\r\nbetween Fort Yuma and Tucson. They appear comfortable in their\r\nhuts,--which are snug dens of oval shape made of mud and reeds thatched\r\nwith _tule_ or wheat straw,--quietly contented with their industrious\r\nwives and their own lazy selves. They make a kind of wine like sour\r\ncider, not nearly so good though, and quaff the vinegar bowl with\r\nsombre hilarity after the corn bread and mutton are disposed at dinner.\r\n\r\nThe tributaries of the Gila bear sweet, soft, meandering Spanish names\r\nwhich I forget. They are rivers of the leaky sort, disappearing by\r\nfitful turns and capriciously starting up again in the deeply worn\r\nchannels. Even in its best strength the Gila (river of swift water) is\r\nnot so large as an Indiana creek which we would blush to call river. It\r\ncontains three kinds of fish; trout, buffalo, and humpback, all equally\r\nmean, of slippery, muddy, flavor and most inferior quality.\r\n\r\nNot far from the Pimo villages, eleven in number, are the written\r\nrocks, mentioned in the oldest histories and described at length\r\nby the early explorers and the modern traveller. At the base of an\r\nimmense bluff are heaps of boulders covered with figures of men and\r\nanimals, rudely carved with some coarse instruments. Uncouth shapes of\r\nbirds, footprints, snakes, and the ever recurring print of a moccasin,\r\nindicative of marching. Many writers attach a value to these ancient\r\ninscriptions; one old Spanish adventurer discerned in them letters like\r\nthe Gothic, Hebrew and Chaldean characters. They are not there to-day;\r\namong hundreds of piled-up boulders and detached stones there is no\r\ntracery like the letters of any known language. Some of the markings\r\nare centuries old and partly effaced, others written over and over\r\nagain. The under sides of the rocks, also, are sculptured where it\r\nwould be impossible to cut them as they lie, and some weigh many tons.\r\nThese last must have fallen from the mountain after the hieroglyphs\r\nwere made. There can be no doubt of their great antiquity and the\r\nlarge numbers of carved stones prove it to have been a resort ages on\r\nages ago, but I doubt the importance of the lines, to me meaningless\r\nzigzags. Indians are the laziest of mortals, and in their childish way\r\nlove to scribble worthless signs, rude pictography on their skins and\r\nthe hides of animals, their walls and potteries. The “Pedros Pintados”\r\nwhich took such hold on Spanish imagination were probably boundary\r\nlines between tribes, and the tortoise, snake and so on are the ancient\r\ntribal symbols, treaties possibly. If they had the deep significance\r\nclaimed by easily excited chroniclers the story would run like this:\r\nThe sons of the North have waded a lake of blood, have swept like the\r\nwhirlwind across the Sierras; the bow has rattled, the arrow flew. We\r\nhave broken the bones of the Apaches, scooped out their eyes and warmed\r\nour hands in their smoking blood. We have scalped the proud warriors\r\nand beaten out the brains of their children. Whoop la! Now let the\r\nearth tremble, for the wolves are let loose on the slain!\r\n\r\nThere are widely scattered ruins in the Gila valleys showing it was\r\nonce densely populated, but the remains are so monotonous they command\r\nlittle interest. The visitor who has seen one has the type of all.\r\nA certain melancholy pathos invests every ruin; houses where men\r\nhave lived and died are more or less haunted, but the relics of New\r\nMexico and Arizona are destitute of anything like grace or comeliness.\r\nThe makers and builders never got beyond the rough adobe, the stone\r\nhatchet and flint arrow-head, and nothing is proved by them except that\r\nthis country has been inhabited from a remote period by a people not\r\ndiffering greatly from the Pueblos of to-day.\r\n\r\nAs we journeyed up the valley we saw herds of antelopes, always too\r\ndistant for a shot. The Rocky mountain antelope is a most beautiful\r\nand graceful animal, of compact form and exceeding strength. The lithe\r\nlimbs are delicate and fleet, feet small and elegant, tail short and\r\ntufted. It is light fawn color, under parts white; its luminous dark\r\neyes are like those of the gazelle of the Orient. Shy and not easily\r\napproached the Indians domesticate them by trapping when very young.\r\nThey have the gentlest, most confiding way of laying their heads in\r\nyour lap, and looking up with the lustrous eyes which have furnished\r\npoets with lovely imagery from the days of Solomon to the nights of\r\nByron. I know no creature with such an appealing manner and such swift\r\ngrace of movement; they speed across the still, wide plain, in the\r\nfarness of the distance appearing like low flying birds.\r\n\r\nThough we are not in the Navajo country we see now and then their\r\nfamous blanket, striped in gayest blue, yellow and red, this last\r\ncolor so dear to the Indian eye, made from ravelling out flannel which\r\nthey buy of the white traders. The dyes are vegetable and absolutely\r\nfadeless. The blanket is coarse, hard and heavy; a good one will shed\r\nwater like rubber, and wear a great while as a horse or saddle blanket.\r\nThe Indian women spin wool in a slow, simple way by rolling in their\r\nhands, and they spend all their spare time for months in making one\r\nblanket which may sell for thirty-five dollars, or if very brilliant\r\nin color and close in texture, for fifty or a hundred dollars. When\r\non the march even, the Navajo woman has her little contrivance for\r\nweaving, on the mule with her, or across her shoulder if on foot, and\r\nin five minutes after the halt is sounded she sits under a tree weaving\r\naway as composedly as though she had been at it for hours. The loom is\r\nnothing but sticks placed horizontally, one at top, two at bottom, far\r\nenough apart to accommodate warp of the blanket’s length or breadth.\r\nBetween these the warp is stretched, and to one straps are attached\r\nto throw over the limb of a tree. At the bottom are other straps, for\r\nthe feet to operate in beating up the filling. In her silent, joyless,\r\npersevering fashion the work goes steadily on, and the weaver is\r\nsatisfied to see it grow at a rate incalculably slow.\r\n\r\nA sufficient measure of civilization is the treatment of women, and\r\namong Apaches we find the deepest degradation. The Pueblo wives are\r\nincomparably better off than those of the nomads. The contrast between\r\nthem and their sisters of the fairer race is more painful than that\r\nbetween men of the two races. I have seen young hunters with stately\r\nforms, erect, lithe and sinewy, and one warrior who might have been a\r\nmodel for Uncas, the favorite hero of our early friend Cooper.\r\n\r\nWe all remember the anecdote Galt tells of Benjamin West. When in Rome\r\nhis friends agreed that the Apollo of Vatican should be the first\r\nstatue shown to the young Philadelphia Quaker. It was enclosed in a\r\ncase, and to try the effect on him suddenly the keeper threw open the\r\ndoors. “A young Mohawk warrior,” exclaimed West.\r\n\r\nBut the likeness is only in the body. The ideal head of the Apollo with\r\nits clustering locks, the exquisite sensitive face with its delicate\r\nmolding of lip and chin, the Phidian forehead and nose, are in highest\r\ncontrast with the sensual, sluggish lineaments of the red man.\r\n\r\nAmong the various tribes there is a dire monotony, and in nothing are\r\nthey more alike than in a lofty scorn of work. The man glories in his\r\nlaziness, the woman exults in her slavery. I have seen an Indian try\r\na heavy lift and set the bag of corn down again with a “Ugh! squaw’s\r\nwork.” If we insinuate he should do the little hoeing for their scant\r\nsupply of beans the woman resents the idea. “Would you have a warrior\r\nwork like a squaw?” is her indignant response to the suggestion.\r\n\r\nI once saw a married couple trudging home, if their cold, smoky, dirty\r\nden may be called by that dear name. The husband, perhaps twenty steps\r\nin advance of the woman who bore on her back a bag of corn. The noble\r\nred man (see J. F. Cooper), waited for her to come up to him, she\r\nhastening her pace as she saw it. Then he slung his rifle on her pack,\r\nfolded his arms across his noble breast, and strode forward with easy\r\ngliding step, in untrammeled dignity. How I longed to hand that noble\r\nred man over to the mercies of a woman’s rights convention.\r\n\r\nThe husband may disfigure or insult the wife at pleasure, divorce\r\nher without form or ceremony by a mere separation, and she has no\r\nprotection or appeal; sometimes his conduct drives her to suicide.\r\nIn divorce it is the unwritten law of the wilderness that children\r\ngo with their mother. Among the wandering tribes mother and baby are\r\nnot divided even in death. A merciful barbarity gives one blow with\r\nthe hatchet, and the little one rests with the best love it can know\r\non earth. They have few children; four are a large family, twins\r\nare unknown, nearly all reach maturity. Among the wild tribes where\r\npolygamy is the rule it is not a cause of complaint among the women,\r\nfrom the fact that it implies a division of labor, and the latest wife\r\nlords it over her predecessors. Even among savages there is no love\r\nlike the last love.\r\n\r\nThe Pimo Indians are not made of “rose-red clay,” they are dark brown,\r\ndiffering in complexion from the Appalachians east of the Rocky\r\nmountains and the olive hues of the California tribes. Historians say\r\nthey have ever been the most active and industrious of the Pueblos;\r\nstill that does not imply the energy and activity of the white race.\r\nThey sit for hours in front of their huts, motionless as a group of\r\npetrifactions. In a mild climate their wants are few and simple, and a\r\nlittle of this world’s goods obtained without much work and less worry\r\nis sufficient for the calm philosophers who despise the arts of the\r\nwhite race and steadily march in the paths of the forefathers.\r\n\r\nI must not leave their country without mention of the wooing of the\r\nyoung Pimo warrior. All Pueblos have but one wife, and no girl is\r\nobliged to marry against her will, however eligible the parents may\r\nconsider any offer. If his bent of love be honorable, his purpose\r\nmarriage, Romeo first wins over the parents by making them presents,\r\nsuch delicacies as pumpkins, beans, coyote skins, or if he is very\r\nwealthy a pony. Then, in banged locks and straggling braids of hair,\r\nhe sits at the door of the lady of his choice serenading her for\r\nhours, day after day, tooting with all his might on a flute of cane,\r\nan instrument of torture with four holes in it. He hides himself in a\r\nbush and like the nightingale “sings darkling.” Sometimes Juliet is a\r\ncoquette and takes no notice of the tender demonstration, leaving him\r\nto keep up the plaintive, shrill noise till\r\n\r\n  “Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day\r\n   Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.”\r\n\r\nIf no notice is taken of the appeal there is no further sign; he\r\nmay hang up his flute, with its bright pencillings and gayly tufted\r\nfringes, and there is no mortification in the rejection. Should she\r\nsmile on his suit she comes out of the coop-like den and the ceremony\r\nis ended. Romeo takes her to his house and the bride is at home. If he\r\nis a man of moderate means the house is built of four upright stakes,\r\nforked at one end, driven into the ground; across these other sticks\r\nare laid to support the roof, which may be of corn shucks, or straw\r\nor rushes. If he is ambitious to have a lasting, palatial mansion\r\nit will be walled round with stakes, plastered and roofed with mud.\r\nAn opening for a door is left about three feet high to creep in at.\r\nThese residences are from five to seven feet high, so one cannot stand\r\nupright in every one. Adjoining the wigwam is a bower of boughs open on\r\nall sides; in this shady lodge are the few potteries in which Juliet\r\ndoes the cooking, and here the happy pair sit on their heels when at\r\nrest, and Romeo smokes while she grinds the corn in the _metate_ of\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the bridegroom will pay the parents all his means\r\nadmit to compensate them for the loss of a hand in the cornfield. The\r\nIndian wife never hears of protoplasm, equal suffrage, social science\r\nand the like. She often builds the wigwam after Romeo has cut the\r\npoles, always bears them on her shoulders in the march, plows the\r\nfields with a crooked stick, raises the beans, hoes the corn, bakes\r\nthe cakes, without a complaint. If her beady, black eyes mark his\r\ncoming and look brighter when he comes I cannot tell why. He is sullen\r\nand still, a dusky shape, the very perfection of gloomy indifference.\r\nPerhaps if he eats the _tortillas_ with an appetite her soul is glad\r\nand she has her reward. If she is content, why sow the seeds of\r\ndissatisfaction by telling her she is a beast of burden and he is a\r\nbeast of prey?\r\n\r\nThe trip through the Pimo country was made memorable by my first\r\nbivouac. ’Twere vain to tell thee all; how a mule drank alkali water,\r\nswelled up and died in an hour, how part of the party had to push\r\nforward with a disabled team, leaving a broken wagon and luggage to\r\nwait the relief, and how a long, hot day brought us to a government\r\nstation. This was a mud shanty thatched with cedar boughs and plastered\r\nwith clay. The edifice was divided into three rooms, the first was a\r\nstable where a gay little pony was pacing round and round without a\r\nhalter. The next was the guest chamber. As I approached, there issued\r\nfrom it a fragrance, the triple extract of raw hide, burnt bacon and\r\nold pipe. The apartment, perhaps sixteen feet square, was without door\r\nor window. The “accommodations” were a mud fireplace in the corner\r\nwhere one might make coffee and fry eggs, and a pile of sheepskins on\r\nwhich the visitor might spread his blanket and sleep,--if he could. The\r\ncedar and mud roof slanted as though it would tumble down any minute.\r\nThe clay floor was unswept, the walls fringed with cobwebs and adorned\r\nwith strings of red pepper, saddles and bridles. In one corner lay bags\r\nof shelled corn; on a swinging shelf were newspapers, an odd volume\r\nof Oliver Twist and sporting magazines. The third room was sacred to\r\nherdsmen and _rancheros_. The keeper of this lodge in a vast wilderness\r\nwas a retired minstrel, and his photograph as jolly endman broadly\r\nsmiled upon us, dangling from enormous deer’s antlers which upheld\r\ndecorative art in lieu of a mantel piece. I took peaceable possession\r\nof the only chair and my fellow traveller through life’s journey\r\nlolled in luxurious ease on the end of a candlebox, while we surveyed\r\nthe “accommodations.” There were three chromos of Evangeline on the\r\nwalls: presumably the peddler closed out his stock there. One picture\r\nof that melancholy maiden sitting on a nameless grave is depressing;\r\ntwo are hardly endurable; three are heart-breaking. I gave way before\r\nthem and said, “We will try an Indian lodge under the open sky.” My\r\nresolution made the idea at once become a pleasant thought. In a barren\r\ncountry the householder, a pilgrim and a stranger, develops a versatile\r\ngenius second only to that of Bernini the Florentine sculptor, artist,\r\npoet, musician, who gave an opera in Rome where he built the theater,\r\ninvented the engines, cut the statues, painted the scenes, wrote\r\nthe comedy and composed the music. In the spirit of communism which\r\npervades the Territories I rummaged the abandoned baggage and found\r\nblankets, buffalo robes, a mattress, one attenuated pillow stuffed with\r\nfeathers pretty much all quill, made “riant” by a pink calico case\r\nruffled all round. No sham about that pillow.\r\n\r\nA clump of stunted pines was the chamber, carpeted with the soft\r\nneedles undisturbed for ages. A Navajo blanket made a striped roof, its\r\nweight a security against puffs of wind even if we had not fastened it\r\nwith strings and tent pins driven into the warm, gravelly sand. The\r\npretty recess, so like a play-house, had a fine charm; spicy with the\r\nfresh scent of the pines, shadowed by a great rock, the pink pillow\r\nlooked rather lumpy but restful and inviting. I felt sure there were\r\npleasant dreams, or better yet, dreamless sleep in the unexpected\r\nluxury.\r\n\r\nWhile I smoothed its tumbled ruffles the gay troubadour came from high\r\npastures with his herds to let them drink at the precious spring, and\r\nthen fold them in a corral made of stakes of mezquit wattled with\r\ncactus.\r\n\r\nThe grama grass on which they feed is described in the books as\r\nincomparably the most nutritive in the world, which may account for\r\nthe grand development of bone in the animals throughout the region.\r\nAll the wild grasses of the country are peculiar in curing themselves\r\nin the stalk. The grama bears no flower, shows no seed, but seems to\r\nreproduce itself from the roots by the shooting up of young, green and\r\nvigorous spires, which are at first inclosed within the sheaths of\r\ntheir old and dried-up predecessors, which by their growth they split\r\nand cast to earth, themselves filling their places. The vast region\r\nswept from immemorial ages by the Apaches is covered with this sort of\r\nlow, mossy grass, and it enables those most savage of savages to make\r\ntheir wonderful marches with their wiry little ponies, which endure\r\nextraordinary fatigue so long as they have this feed in abundance, and\r\nare allowed to crop it from native _pasturas_.\r\n\r\nThe troubadour who kept the wayside inn was a handsome scamp, a\r\ncaptivating runaway from civilization, calling himself John Smith,\r\nwhich I am sure is not his name. He apologized for the absence of\r\nhis cook (who had no existence on earth), and in festal mood, with\r\nmany flourishes, insisted on displaying his own skill in the culinary\r\nscience. He graduated under the celebrated Micawber many years ago, and\r\nwould like nothing better than a “hot supper of his own getting up.”\r\n\r\nWith the help of a Mexican _peon_, he deftly and rapidly concocted and\r\nserved in the Evangeline apartment various poisons, liquid and solid,\r\nspreading them on a pine table covered with newspapers. Conspicuous\r\namong the dishes were hot death-balls, with lightning zigzags of deadly\r\ndrugs, known on the frontier as “soddy biscuit.” Under the beguiling\r\nname of spring lamb we had paid an exhaustive price for a section of\r\nancient ram which might have battered the walls of Babylon. Fire made\r\nno impression on it, and the chops rebounded under the teeth like\r\nIndia-rubber. However we had the usual reserve of crackers, ham, canned\r\nfruit, and I drank to the general joy of the whole table in a glass of\r\nwithered lemonade. The gentlemen ate with cannibal appetite, and so far\r\nfrom dropping dead, as I feared, seemed refreshed by the reflection.\r\nThe banquet ended, we insisted on music from the obscured, let me not\r\nsay fallen, star, and the banjo was brought forth from its case under\r\nthe festive board. Brudder Bones had a rich and delightful voice, and\r\nwe listened to him with unaffected enjoyment. One by one the herdsmen\r\ncame by leading their lean and thirsty sheep, making a picturesque\r\nspectacle as they passed to the spring.\r\n\r\nBack of the miserable hut stretched a plain, level as water, three\r\nmiles to the foot-hills; far beyond were the Sierras, purple to the\r\nsnow line, then a shining silver chain. Their unspeakable beauty haunts\r\nme still like some enchanting vision in which I beheld a new heaven\r\nand a new earth. Beyond the bower rose a heap of boulders, bare except\r\nfor the tall yucca’s cream-white blossoms which decked them in bridal\r\nbrightness, and a species of night-blooming cereus that with the\r\ndeclining day unfolded every petal and filled the air with a fragrance\r\nlike white lilies. On a bench in front of the hut sat a prospector\r\nand the belated travellers; lounging on blankets and skins were half\r\na dozen soldiers, a Pueblo Indian, a negro and a Mexican _peon_. The\r\nbanjo did its best for the musician occupying the candle box; I was\r\nenthroned in the only chair. A mixed company, representative of the\r\nborder races.\r\n\r\nWhat should we sing but “Tenting to-night boys,” and “Oft in the stilly\r\nnight,” the twilight song with its tender memories of the lost loves\r\nburied many a year ago? Lastly, in the solemn beauty of the afterglow,\r\nwe gave “John Brown’s Body” with a rousing chorus in honor of the\r\ngraves forever green and glorious.\r\n\r\nA line of crimson lights flamed along the mountain peaks, then the drop\r\ncurtain of violet and pearl gray fell softly through the speckless\r\nsapphire and over the darkening hills. ’Twas time to say good-night;\r\nmost of the herdsmen wrapped themselves in blankets and rolled like\r\nlogs on the ground; the passive ragged _peon_ bowed in courteous grace\r\nwith gently spoken _adios_, and lay against the side of the hut, his\r\ndelicate face upturned to the sky. Old uncle Ned made a tiny fire of\r\npine cones “to toas my feet, missis,” as he muffled head and ears in an\r\narmy coat on which a shred of shoulder strap hinted of better days. We,\r\ntoo, said “good-night.” Besides the old songs my ear was haunted with\r\ndim æolian soundings mingling an evening strain from the Koran:\r\n\r\n  “Have we not given you the earth for a bed,\r\n   And made you husband and wife?\r\n   And given you sleep for rest,\r\n   And made you a mantle of night?”\r\n\r\nBut I could not sleep thus mantled in that Eden bower. The air was so\r\nelectric that five lines of fire followed my fingers as I drew them\r\nacross the buffalo robe. I was in that state known to most women and\r\na few men when my eyelids would _not_ close. I felt as if the seven\r\ndoors of the enchanted lantern were opened and I could see all over\r\nthe world. There was nothing to fear, but a sense of strangeness and\r\nawe held me. The spangled arch which upholds the throne of God,--its\r\nsplendor robbed me of my rest; my spirit was not fitted to the\r\nmagnificent infinite palace. Of the exquisite beauty of that balmy\r\nsemi-tropic night I hardly trust myself to speak. Through the soft\r\nperfumed dusk, through the leafy tent, the stars glowed resplendent.\r\nNone missing there; the lost Pleiad found her sisters; Aldebaran\r\nshone in the East; Arcturus and his sons; Orion belted and spurred\r\nwith jewels. The blanket slipped from its fastenings and there was\r\nno curtaining to veil the far-off mystery of my boundless bed-room.\r\nThe cool night breeze fanned my face as I watched the lofty spaces\r\nso solemn, so wondrous fair. I had often slept in the ambulance with\r\ncurtains close-buttoned; that was a room. The walls of this apartment\r\nwere limitless.\r\n\r\nRestlessly turning on the pink pillow I thought of eyes that are\r\nlooking down, not up at the starry hosts, and the voice now beyond them\r\nwhich used to sing to the air of “Bonnie Doon,”\r\n\r\n  “Forever and forevermore,\r\n   The star, the star of Bethlehem.”\r\n\r\nThe goats and sheep were at rest, the hurt lamb had ceased its bleat,\r\nthe light in the ranche went out. In the stilly night silence all,\r\nsave the low wind soughing in the pines making midnight hush the\r\ndeeper. The long howl of a dog in the distance. Was he barking at the\r\nsilver boat in the blue bay overhead? What sailors manned that fairy\r\ncraft? Did they understand the mysteries and could they answer my\r\nweary questionings? What saw they in the unfathomable depths? and what\r\nmeant that signal shot from the slender bow across the trackless blue,\r\ndropping sparkles of fire through the dusk?\r\n\r\nGood night, Good night!\r\n\r\n  THE END.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes:\r\n\r\nFootnotes have been moved to the end of each chapter and relabeled\r\nconsecutively through the document.\r\n\r\nIllustrations have been moved to paragraph breaks, except for the\r\nfrontispiece.\r\n\r\nPunctuation has been made consistent.\r\n\r\nVariations in spelling and hyphenation were retained as they appear in\r\nthe original publication, except that obvious typographical errors have\r\nbeen corrected.\r\n\r\nThe following changes were made:\r\n\r\nSanta Fè has been changed to Santa Fé throughout.\r\n\r\np. 45: Taguna changed to Laguna (the Laguna mission,)",
