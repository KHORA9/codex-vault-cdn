He will feel himself a master spirit in the\r\nwilderness he traverses, and not the victim of every _new_ combination\r\nof circumstances which nature affords or fate allots, as if to try his\r\nskill and prowess.\r\n\r\nI have waited for several years, with the confident expectation that\r\nsome one more competent than myself would assume the task, and give the\r\npublic the desired information; but it seems that no one has taken\r\nsufficient interest in the subject to disseminate the benefits of his\r\nexperience in this way. Our frontier-men, although brave in council and\r\naction, and possessing an intelligence that quickens in the face of\r\ndanger, are apt to feel shy of the pen. They shun the atmosphere of the\r\nstudent's closet; their sphere is in the free and open wilderness. It\r\nis not to be wondered at, therefore, that to our veteran borderer the\r\nfield of literature should remain a \"_terra incognita_.\" It is our\r\narmy that unites the chasm between the culture of civilization in the\r\naspect of science, art, and social refinement, and the powerful\r\nsimplicity of nature. On leaving the Military Academy, a majority of\r\nour officers are attached to the line of the army, and forthwith\r\nassigned to duty upon our remote and extended frontier, where the\r\nrestless and warlike habits of the nomadic tribes render the soldier's\r\nlife almost as unsettled as that of the savages themselves.\r\n\r\nA regiment is stationed to-day on the borders of tropical Mexico;\r\nto-morrow, the war-whoop, borne on a gale from the northwest, compels\r\nits presence in the frozen latitudes of Puget's Sound. The very limited\r\nnumerical strength of our army, scattered as it is over a vast area of\r\nterritory, necessitates constant changes of stations, long and toilsome\r\nmarches, a promptitude of action, and a tireless energy and\r\nself-reliance, that can only be acquired through an intimate\r\nacquaintance with the sphere in which we act and move.\r\n\r\nThe education of our officers at the Military Academy is doubtless well\r\nadapted to the art of civilized warfare, but can not familiarize them\r\nwith the diversified details of border service; and they often, at the\r\noutset of their military career, find themselves compelled to improvise\r\nnew expedients to meet novel emergences.\r\n\r\nThe life of the wilderness is an _art_ as well as that of the city\r\nor court, and every art subjects its votaries to discipline in\r\npreparing them for a successful career in its pursuit. The Military\r\nArt, as enlarged to meet all the requirements of border service, the\r\nsavage in his wiles or the elements in their caprices, embraces many\r\nother special arts which have hitherto been almost ignored, and results\r\nwhich experience and calculation should have guaranteed have been\r\nimprovidently staked upon favorable chances.\r\n\r\nThe main object at which I have aimed in the following pages has been\r\nto explain and illustrate, as clearly and succinctly as possible, the\r\nbest methods of performing the duties devolving upon the prairie\r\ntraveler, so as to meet their contingencies under all circumstances,\r\nand thereby to endeavor to establish a more uniform system of marching\r\nand campaigning in the Indian country.\r\n\r\nI have also furnished itineraries of most of the principal routes that\r\nhave been traveled across the plains, taken from the best and most\r\nreliable authorities; and I have given some information concerning the\r\nhabits of the Indians and wild animals that frequent the prairies, with\r\nthe secrets of the hunter's and warrior's strategy, which I have\r\nendeavored to impress more forcibly upon the reader by introducing\r\nillustrative anecdote.\r\n\r\nI take great pleasure in acknowledging my indebtedness to several\r\nofficers of the Topographical Engineers and of other corps of the army\r\nfor the valuable information I have obtained from their official\r\nreports regarding the different routes embraced in the itineraries, and\r\nto these gentlemen I beg leave very respectfully to dedicate my book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRAIRIE TRAVELER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nThe different Routes to California and Oregon. Their respective\r\nAdvantages. Organization of Companies. Elections of Captains.\r\nWagons and Teams. Relative Merits of Mules and Oxen. Stores\r\nand Provisions. How packed.

Arms.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUTES TO CALIFORNIA AND OREGON.\r\n\r\nEmigrants or others desiring to make the overland journey to the\r\nPacific should bear in mind that there are several different routes\r\nwhich may be traveled with wagons, each having its advocates in persons\r\ndirectly or indirectly interested in attracting the tide of emigration\r\nand travel over them.\r\n\r\nInformation concerning these routes coming from strangers living or\r\nowning property near them, from agents of steam-boats or railways, or\r\nfrom other persons connected with transportation companies, should be\r\nreceived with great caution, and never without corroborating evidence\r\nfrom disinterested sources.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that each one of these roads has its advantages and\r\ndisadvantages, but a judicious selection must depend chiefly upon the\r\nfollowing considerations, namely, the locality from whence the\r\nindividual is to take his departure, the season of the year when he\r\ndesires to commence his journey, the character of his means of\r\ntransportation, and the point upon the Pacific coast that he wishes to\r\nreach.\r\n\r\nPersons living in the Northeastern States can, with about equal\r\nfacility and dispatch, reach the eastern terminus of any one of the\r\nroutes they may select by means of public transport. And, as animals\r\nare much cheaper upon the frontier than in the Eastern States, they\r\nshould purchase their teams at or near the point where the overland\r\njourney is to commence.\r\n\r\nThose living in the Northwestern States, having their own teams, and\r\nwishing to go to any point north of San Francisco, will of course make\r\nchoice of the route which takes its departure from the Missouri River.\r\n\r\nThose who live in the middle Western States, having their own means of\r\ntransportation, and going to any point upon the Pacific coast, should\r\ntake one of the middle routes.\r\n\r\nOthers, who reside in the extreme Southwest, and whose destination is\r\nsouth of San Francisco, should travel the southern road running through\r\nTexas, which is the only one practicable for comfortable winter travel.\r\nThe grass upon a great portion of this route is green during the entire\r\nwinter, and snow seldom covers it. This road leaves the Gulf coast at\r\n_Powder-horn_, on Matagorda Bay, which point is difficult of access by\r\nland from the north, but may be reached by steamers from New Orleans\r\nfive times a week.\r\n\r\nThere are stores at Powder-horn and Indianola where the traveler can\r\nobtain most of the articles necessary for his journey, but I would\r\nrecommend him to supply himself before leaving New Orleans with every\r\nthing he requires with the exception of animals, which he will find\r\ncheaper in Texas.\r\n\r\nThis road has received a large amount of travel since 1849, is well\r\ntracked and defined, and, excepting about twenty miles of \"_hog\r\nwallow prairie_\" near Powder-horn, it is an excellent road for\r\ncarriages and wagons. It passes through a settled country for 250\r\nmiles, and within this section supplies can be had at reasonable rates.\r\n\r\nAt Victoria and San Antonio many fine stores will be found, well\r\nsupplied with large stocks of goods, embracing all the articles the\r\ntraveler will require.\r\n\r\nThe next route to the north is that over which the semi-weekly mail to\r\nCalifornia passes, and which, for a great portion of the way to New\r\nMexico, I traveled and recommended in 1849. This road leaves the\r\nArkansas River at Fort Smith, to which point steamers run during the\r\nseasons of high water in the winter and spring.\r\n\r\nSupplies of all descriptions necessary for the overland journey may be\r\nprocured at Fort Smith, or at Van Buren on the opposite side of the\r\nArkansas. Horses and cattle are cheap here. The road, on leaving Fort\r\nSmith, passes through the Choctaw and Chickasaw country for 180 miles,\r\nthen crosses Red River by ferry-boat at Preston, and runs through the\r\nborder settlements of northern Texas for 150 miles, within which\r\ndistances supplies may be procured at moderate prices.\r\n\r\nThis road is accessible to persons desiring to make the entire journey\r\nwith their own transportation from Tennessee or Mississippi, by\r\ncrossing the Mississippi River at Memphis or Helena, passing Little\r\nRock, and thence through Washington County, intersecting the road at\r\nPreston. It may also be reached by taking steamers up Red River to\r\nShreveport or Jefferson, from either of which places there are roads\r\nrunning through a populated country, and intersecting the Fort Smith\r\nroad near Preston.\r\n\r\nThis road also unites with the San Antonio road at El Paso, and from\r\nthat point they pass together over the mountains to Fort Yuma and to\r\nSan Francisco in California.\r\n\r\nAnother road leaves Fort Smith and runs up the south side of the\r\nCanadian River to Santa Fe and Albuquerque in New Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis route is set down upon most of the maps of the present day as\r\nhaving been discovered and explored by various persons, but my own name\r\nseems to have been carefully excluded from the list. Whether this\r\nomission has been intentional or not, I leave for the authors to\r\ndetermine. I shall merely remark that I had the command and entire\r\ndirection of an expedition which in 1849 discovered, explored, located,\r\nand marked out this identical wagon road from Fort Smith, Arkansas, to\r\nSanta Fe, New Mexico, and that this road, for the greater portion of\r\nthe distance, is the same that has been since recommended for a Pacific\r\nrailway.\r\n\r\nThis road, near Albuquerque, unites with Captain Whipple's and\r\nLieutenant Beall's roads to California.\r\n\r\nAnother road, which takes its departure from Fort Smith and passes\r\nthrough the Cherokee country, is called the \"Cherokee Trail.\" It\r\ncrosses Grand River at Fort Gibson, and runs a little north of west to\r\nthe Verdigris River, thence up the valley of this stream on the north\r\nside for 80 miles, when it crosses the river, and, taking a northwest\r\ncourse, strikes the Arkansas River near old Fort Mann, on the Santa Fe\r\ntrace; thence it passes near the base of Pike's Peak, and follows down\r\nCherry Creek from its source to its confluence with the South Platte,\r\nand from thence over the mountains into Utah, and on to California\r\n_via_ Fort Bridger and Salt Lake City.\r\n\r\nFor persons who desire to go from the Southern States to the gold\r\ndiggings in the vicinity of Cherry Creek, this route is shorter by\r\nsome 300 miles than that from Fort Smith _via_ Fort Leavenworth. It\r\nis said to be an excellent road, and well supplied with the requisites\r\nfor encamping. It has been traveled by large parties of California\r\nemigrants for several years, and is well tracked and defined.\r\n\r\nThe grass upon all the roads leaving Fort Smith is sufficiently\r\nadvanced to afford sustenance to animals by the first of April, and\r\nfrom this time until winter sets in it is abundant. The next route on\r\nthe north leaves the Missouri River at Westport, Leavenworth City,\r\nAtcheson, or from other towns above, between either of which points and\r\nSt. Louis steamers ply during the entire summer season.\r\n\r\nThe necessary outfit of supplies can always be procured at any of the\r\nstarting-points on the Missouri River at moderate rates.\r\n\r\nThis is the great emigrant route from Missouri to California and\r\nOregon, over which so many thousands have traveled within the past few\r\nyears. The track is broad, well worn, and can not be mistaken. It has\r\nreceived the major part of the Mormon emigration, and was traversed by\r\nthe army in its march to Utah in 1857.\r\n\r\nAt the point where this road crosses the South Platte River, Lieutenant\r\nBryan's road branches off to the left, leading through Bridger's Pass,\r\nand thence to Fort Bridger. The Fort Kearney route to the gold region\r\nnear Pike's Peak also leaves the emigrant road at this place and runs\r\nup the South Platte.\r\n\r\nFrom Fort Bridger there are two roads that may be traveled with wagons\r\nin the direction of California; one passing Salt Lake City, and the\r\nother running down Bear River to Soda Springs, intersecting the Salt\r\nLake City road at the _City of Rocks_. Near Soda Springs the Oregon\r\nroad turns to the right, passing Fort Hall, and thence down Snake River\r\nto Fort Wallah-Wallah. Unless travelers have business in Salt Lake\r\nValley, I would advise them to take the Bear River route, as it is much\r\nshorter, and better in every respect. The road, on leaving the Missouri\r\nRiver, passes for 150 miles through a settled country where grain can\r\nbe purchased cheap, and there are several stores in this section where\r\nmost of the articles required by travelers can be obtained.\r\n\r\nMany persons who have had much experience in prairie traveling prefer\r\nleaving the Missouri River in March or April, and feeding grain to\r\ntheir animals until the new grass appears. The roads become muddy and\r\nheavy after the spring rains set in, and by starting out early the\r\nworst part of the road will be passed over before the ground becomes\r\nwet and soft. This plan, however, should never be attempted unless the\r\nanimals are well supplied with grain, and kept in good condition. They\r\nwill eat the old grass in the spring, but it does not, in this climate,\r\nas in Utah and New Mexico, afford them sufficient sustenance.\r\n\r\nThe grass, after the 1st of May, is good and abundant upon this road as\r\nfar as the South Pass, from whence there is a section of about 50 miles\r\nwhere it is scarce; there is also a scarcity upon the desert beyond the\r\nsink of the Humboldt. As large numbers of cattle pass over the road\r\nannually, they soon consume all the grass in these barren localities,\r\nand such as pass late in the season are likely to suffer greatly, and\r\noftentimes perish from starvation. When I came over the road in August,\r\n1858, I seldom found myself out of sight of dead cattle for 500 miles\r\nalong the road, and this was an unusually favorable year for grass, and\r\nbefore the main body of animals had passed for that season.\r\n\r\nUpon the head of the Sweetwater River, and west of the South Pass,\r\nalkaline springs are met with, which are exceedingly poisonous to\r\ncattle and horses. They can readily be detected by the yellowish-red\r\ncolor of the grass growing around them. Animals should never be allowed\r\nto graze near them or to drink the water.\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF COMPANIES.\r\n\r\nAfter a particular route has been selected to make the journey across\r\nthe plains, and the requisite number have arrived at the eastern\r\nterminus, their first business should be to organize themselves into a\r\ncompany and elect a commander. The company should be of sufficient\r\nmagnitude to herd and guard animals, and for protection against\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nFrom 50 to 70 men, properly armed and equipped, will be enough for\r\nthese purposes, and any greater number only makes the movements of the\r\nparty more cumbersome and tardy.\r\n\r\nIn the selection of a captain, good judgment, integrity of purpose, and\r\npractical experience are the essential requisites, and these are\r\nindispensable to the harmony and consolidation of the association. His\r\nduty should be to direct the order of march, the time of starting and\r\nhalting, to select the camps, detail and give orders to guards, and,\r\nindeed, to control and superintend all the movements of the company.\r\n\r\nAn obligation should then be drawn up and signed by all the members of\r\nthe association, wherein each one should bind himself to abide in all\r\ncases by the orders and decisions of the captain, and to aid him by\r\nevery means in his power in the execution of his duties; and they\r\nshould also obligate themselves to aid each other, so as to make the\r\nindividual interest of each member the common concern of the whole\r\ncompany. To insure this, a fund should be raised for the purchase of\r\nextra animals to supply the places of those which may give out or die\r\non the road; and if the wagon or team of a particular member should\r\nfail and have to be abandoned, the company should obligate themselves\r\nto transport his luggage, and the captain should see that he has his\r\nshare of transportation equal with any other member. Thus it will be\r\nmade the interest of every member of the company to watch over and\r\nprotect the property of others as well as his own.\r\n\r\nIn case of failure on the part of any one to comply with the\r\nobligations imposed by the articles of agreement after they have been\r\nduly executed, the company should of course have the power to punish\r\nthe delinquent member, and, if necessary, to exclude him from all the\r\nbenefits of the association.\r\n\r\nOn such a journey as this, there is much to interest and amuse one who\r\nis fond of picturesque scenery, and of wild life in its most primitive\r\naspect, yet no one should attempt it without anticipating many rough\r\nknocks and much hard labor; every man must expect to do his share of\r\nduty faithfully and without a murmur.\r\n\r\nOn long and arduous expeditions men are apt to become irritable and\r\nill-natured, and oftentimes fancy they have more labor imposed upon\r\nthem than their comrades, and that the person who directs the march is\r\npartial toward his favorites, etc. That man who exercises the greatest\r\nforbearance under such circumstances, who is cheerful, slow to take up\r\nquarrels, and endeavors to reconcile difficulties among his companions,\r\nis deserving of all praise, and will, without doubt, contribute largely\r\nto the success and comfort of an expedition.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of an association such as I have mentioned are\r\nmanifestly numerous. The animals can be herded together and guarded by\r\nthe different members of the company in rotation, thereby securing to\r\nall the opportunities of sleep and rest. Besides, this is the only way\r\nto resist depredations of the Indians, and to prevent their stampeding\r\nand driving off animals; and much more efficiency is secured in every\r\nrespect, especially in crossing streams, repairing roads, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nUnless a systematic organization be adopted, it is impossible for a\r\nparty of any magnitude to travel in company for any great length of\r\ntime, and for all the members to agree upon the same arrangements in\r\nmarching, camping, etc. I have several times observed, where this has\r\nbeen attempted, that discords and dissensions sooner or later arose\r\nwhich invariably resulted in breaking up and separating the company.\r\n\r\nWhen a captain has once been chosen, he should be sustained in all his\r\ndecisions unless he commit some manifest outrage, when a majority of\r\nthe company can always remove him, and put a more competent man in his\r\nplace. Sometimes men may be selected who, upon trial, do not come up to\r\nthe anticipations of those who have placed them in power, and other men\r\nwill exhibit, during the course of the march, more capacity. Under\r\nthese circumstances it will not be unwise to make a change, the first\r\nelection having been distinctly provisional.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAGONS AND TEAMS.\r\n\r\nA company having been organized, its first interest is to procure a\r\nproper outfit of transportation and supplies for the contemplated\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nWagons should be of the simplest possible construction--strong, light,\r\nand made of well-seasoned timber, especially the wheels, as the\r\natmosphere, in the elevated and arid region over which they have to\r\npass, is so exceedingly dry during the summer months that, unless the\r\nwood-work is thoroughly seasoned, they will require constant repairs to\r\nprevent them from falling to pieces.\r\n\r\nWheels made of the bois-d'arc, or Osage orange-wood, are the best for\r\nthe plains, as they shrink but little, and seldom want repairing. As,\r\nhowever, this wood is not easily procured in the Northern States, white\r\noak answers a very good purpose if well seasoned.\r\n\r\nSpring wagons made in Concord, New Hampshire, are used to transport\r\npassengers and the mails upon some of the routes across the plains, and\r\nthey are said, by those who have used them, to be much superior to any\r\nothers. They are made of the close-grained oak that grows in a high\r\nnorthern latitude, and well seasoned.\r\n\r\nThe pole of the wagon should have a joint where it enters the hounds,\r\nto prevent the weight from coming upon it and breaking the hounds in\r\npassing short and abrupt holes in the road.\r\n\r\nThe perch or coupling-pole should be shifting or movable, as, in the\r\nevent of the loss of a wheel, an axle, or other accident rendering it\r\nnecessary to abandon the wagon, a temporary cart may be constructed out\r\nof the remaining portion. The tires should be examined just before\r\ncommencing the journey, and, if not perfectly snug, reset.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief causes of accidents to carriages upon the plains\r\narises from the nuts coming off from the numerous bolts that secure the\r\nrunning gearing. To prevent this, the ends of all the bolts should be\r\nriveted; it is seldom necessary to take them off, and when this is\r\nrequired the ends of the bolts may easily be filed away.\r\n\r\nWagons with six mules should never, on a long journey over the\r\nprairies, be loaded with over 2000 pounds, unless grain is transported,\r\nwhen an additional thousand pounds may be taken, provided it is fed out\r\ndaily to the team. When grass constitutes the only forage, 2000 pounds\r\nis deemed a sufficient load. I regard our government wagons as\r\nunnecessarily heavy for six mules. There is sufficient material in them\r\nto sustain a burden of 4000 pounds, but they are seldom loaded with\r\nmore than half that weight. Every wagon should be furnished with\r\nsubstantial bows and double osnaburg covers, to protect its contents\r\nfrom the sun and weather.\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion regarding the relative merits of mules\r\nand oxen for prairie traveling, and the question is yet far from being\r\nsettled. Upon good firm roads, in a populated country, where grain can\r\nbe procured, I should unquestionably give the preference to mules, as\r\nthey travel faster, and endure the heat of summer much better than\r\noxen; and if the journey be not over 1000 miles, and the grass\r\nabundant, even without grain, I think mules would be preferable. But\r\nwhen the march is to extend 1500 or 2000 miles, or over a rough sandy\r\nor muddy road, I believe young oxen will endure better than mules; they\r\nwill, if properly managed, keep in better condition, and perform the\r\njourney in an equally brief space of time. Besides, they are much more\r\neconomical, a team of six mules costing six hundred dollars, while an\r\neight-ox team only costs upon the frontier about two hundred dollars.\r\nOxen are much less liable to be stampeded and driven off by Indians,\r\nand can be pursued and overtaken by horsemen; and, finally, they can,\r\nif necessary, be used for beef.\r\n\r\nIn Africa oxen are used as saddle animals, and it is said that they\r\nperform good service in this way. This will probably be regarded by our\r\npeople as a very undignified and singular method of locomotion, but, in\r\nthe absence of any other means of transportation upon a long journey, a\r\nsaddle-ox might be found serviceable.\r\n\r\nAndersson, in his work on Southwestern Africa, says: \"A short strong\r\nstick, of peculiar shape, is forced through the cartilage of the nose\r\nof the ox, and to either end of this stick is attached (in bridle\r\nfashion) a tough leathern thong. From the extreme tenderness of the\r\nnose he is now more easily managed.\" \"Hans presented me with an ox\r\ncalled 'Spring,' which I afterward rode upward of two thousand miles.\r\nOn the day of our departure he mounted us all on oxen, and a curious\r\nsight it was to see some of the men take their seats who had never\r\nbefore ridden on ox-back. It is impossible to guide an ox as one would\r\nguide a horse, for in the attempt to do so you would instantly jerk the\r\nstick out of his nose, which at once deprives you of every control over\r\nthe beast; but by pulling _both_ sides of the bridle at the same time,\r\nand toward the side you wish him to take, he is easily managed.[1] Your\r\nseat is not less awkward and difficult; for the skin of the ox, unlike\r\nthat of the horse, is loose, and, notwithstanding your saddle may be\r\ntightly girthed, you keep rocking to and fro like a child in a cradle.\r\nA few days, however, enables a person to acquire a certain steadiness,\r\nand long habit will do the rest.\"\r\n\r\n      [1] A ring instead of the stick put through the cartilage of the\r\n      nose would obviate this difficulty.--AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\"Ox traveling, when once a man becomes accustomed to it, is not so\r\ndisagreeable as might be expected, particularly if one succeeds in\r\nobtaining a tractable animal. On emergencies, an ox can be made to\r\nproceed at a tolerable quick pace; for, though his walk is only about\r\nthree miles an hour at an average, he may be made to perform double\r\nthat distance in the same time. Mr. Galton once accomplished 24 miles\r\nin four hours, and that, too, through heavy sand!\"\r\n\r\nCows will be found very useful upon long journeys when the rate of\r\ntravel is slow, as they furnish milk, and in emergencies they may be\r\nworked in wagons. I once saw a small cow yoked beside a large ox, and\r\ndriven about six hundred miles attached to a loaded wagon, and she\r\nperformed her part equally well with the ox. It has been by no means an\r\nunusual thing for emigrant travelers to work cows in their teams.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Pembina, on Red River, work a single ox harnessed in\r\nshafts like a horse, and they transport a thousand pounds in a rude\r\ncart made entirely of wood, without a particle of iron. One man drives\r\nand takes the entire charge of eight or ten of these teams upon long\r\njourneys. This is certainly a very economical method of transportation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORES AND PROVISIONS.\r\n\r\nSupplies for a march should be put up in the most secure, compact, and\r\nportable shape.\r\n\r\nBacon should be packed in strong sacks of a hundred pounds to each; or,\r\nin very hot climates, put in boxes and surrounded with bran, which in a\r\ngreat measure prevents the fat from melting away.\r\n\r\nIf pork be used, in order to avoid transporting about forty per cent.\r\nof useless weight, it should be taken out of the barrels and packed\r\nlike the bacon; then so placed in the bottom of the wagons as to keep\r\nit cool. The pork, if well cured, will keep several months in this way,\r\nbut bacon is preferable.\r\n\r\nFlour should be packed in stout double canvas sacks well sewed, a\r\nhundred pounds in each sack.\r\n\r\nButter may be preserved by boiling it thoroughly, and skimming off the\r\nscum as it rises to the top until it is quite clear like oil. It is\r\nthen placed in tin canisters and soldered up. This mode of preserving\r\nbutter has been adopted in the hot climate of southern Texas, and it is\r\nfound to keep sweet for a great length of time, and its flavor is but\r\nlittle impaired by the process.\r\n\r\nSugar may be well secured in India-rubber or gutta-percha sacks, or so\r\nplaced in the wagon as not to risk getting wet.\r\n\r\nDesiccated or dried vegetables are almost equal to the fresh, and are\r\nput up in such a compact and portable form as easily to be transported\r\nover the plains. They have been extensively used in the Crimean war,\r\nand by our own army in Utah, and have been very generally approved.\r\nThey are prepared by cutting the fresh vegetables into thin slices and\r\nsubjecting them to a very powerful press, which removes the juice and\r\nleaves a solid cake, which, after having been thoroughly dried in an\r\noven, becomes almost as hard as a rock. A small piece of this, about\r\nhalf the size of a man's hand, when boiled, swells up so as to fill a\r\nvegetable dish, and is sufficient for four men. It is believed that the\r\nantiscorbutic properties of vegetables are not impaired by desiccation,\r\nand they will keep for years if not exposed to dampness. Canned\r\nvegetables are very good for campaigning, but are not so portable as\r\nwhen put up in the other form. The desiccated vegetables used in our\r\narmy have been prepared by Chollet and Co., 46 Rue Richer, Paris. There\r\nis an agency for them in New York. I regard these compressed vegetables\r\nas the best preparation for prairie traveling that has yet been\r\ndiscovered. A single ration weighs, before being boiled, only an ounce,\r\nand a cubic yard contains 16,000 rations. In making up their outfit for\r\nthe plains, men are very prone to overload their teams with a great\r\nvariety of useless articles. It is a good rule to carry nothing more\r\nthan is absolutely necessary for use upon the journey. One can not\r\nexpect, with the limited allowance of transportation that emigrants\r\nusually have, to indulge in luxuries upon such expeditions, and\r\narticles for use in California can be purchased there at less cost than\r\nthat of overland transport.\r\n\r\nThe allowance of provisions for men in marching should be much greater\r\nthan when they take no exercise. The army ration I have always found\r\ninsufficient for soldiers who perform hard service, yet it is ample for\r\nthem when in quarters.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the amount of subsistence consumed per day by\r\neach man of Dr. Rae's party, in his spring journey to the Arctic\r\nregions of North America in 1854:\r\n\r\n    Pemmican                          1.25 lbs.\r\n    Biscuit                           0.25  \"\r\n    Edward's preserved potatoes       0.10  \"\r\n    Flour                             0.33  \"\r\n    Tea                               0.03  \"\r\n    Sugar                             0.14  \"\r\n    Grease or alcohol, for cooking    0.25  \"\r\n                                      ----\r\n                                      2.35 lbs.\r\n\r\nThis allowance of a little over two pounds of the most nutritious food\r\nwas found barely sufficient to subsist the men in that cold climate.\r\n\r\nThe pemmican, which constitutes almost the entire diet of the Fur\r\nCompany's men in the Northwest, is prepared as follows: The buffalo\r\nmeat is cut into thin flakes, and hung up to dry in the sun or before a\r\nslow fire; it is then pounded between two stones and reduced to a\r\npowder; this powder is placed in a bag of the animal's hide, with the\r\nhair on the outside; melted grease is then poured into it, and the bag\r\nsewn up. It can be eaten raw, and many prefer it so. Mixed with a\r\nlittle flour and boiled, it is a very wholesome and exceedingly\r\nnutritious food, and will keep fresh for a long time.\r\n\r\nI would advise all persons who travel for any considerable time through\r\na country where they can procure no vegetables to carry with them some\r\nantiscorbutics, and if they can not transport desiccated or canned\r\nvegetables, citric acid answers a good purpose, and is very portable.\r\nWhen mixed with sugar and water, with a few drops of the essence of\r\nlemon, it is difficult to distinguish it from lemonade. Wild onions are\r\nexcellent as antiscorbutics; also wild grapes and greens. An infusion\r\nof hemlock leaves is also said to be an antidote to scurvy.\r\n\r\nThe most portable and simple preparation of subsistence that I know of,\r\nand which is used extensively by the Mexicans and Indians, is called\r\n\"_cold flour_.\" It is made by parching corn, and pounding it in a\r\nmortar to the consistency of coarse meal; a little sugar and cinnamon\r\nadded makes it quite palatable. When the traveler becomes hungry or\r\nthirsty, a little of the flour is mixed with water and drunk. It is an\r\nexcellent article for a traveler who desires to go the greatest length\r\nof time upon the smallest amount of transportation. It is said that\r\nhalf a bushel is sufficient to subsist a man thirty days.\r\n\r\nPersons undergoing severe labor, and driven to great extremities for\r\nfood, will derive sustenance from various sources that would never\r\noccur to them under ordinary circumstances. In passing over the Rocky\r\nMountains during the winter of 1857-8, our supplies of provisions were\r\nentirely consumed eighteen days before reaching the first settlements\r\nin New Mexico, and we were obliged to resort to a variety of expedients\r\nto supply the deficiency. Our poor mules were fast failing and dropping\r\ndown from exhaustion in the deep snows, and our only dependence for the\r\nmeans of sustaining life was upon these starved animals as they became\r\nunserviceable and could go no farther. We had no salt, sugar, coffee,\r\nor tobacco, which, at a time when men are performing the severest labor\r\nthat the human system is capable of enduring, was a great privation. In\r\nthis destitute condition we found a substitute for tobacco in the bark\r\nof the red willow, which grows upon many of the mountain streams in\r\nthat vicinity. The outer bark is first removed with a knife, after\r\nwhich the inner bark is scraped up into ridges around the sticks, and\r\nheld in the fire until it is thoroughly roasted, when it is taken off\r\nthe stick, pulverized in the hand, and is ready for smoking. It has the\r\nnarcotic properties of the tobacco, and is quite agreeable to the taste\r\nand smell. The sumach leaf is also used by the Indians in the same way,\r\nand has a similar taste to the willow bark. A decoction of the dried\r\nwild or horse mint, which we found abundant under the snow, was quite\r\npalatable, and answered instead of coffee. It dries up in that climate,\r\nbut does not lose its flavor. We suffered greatly for the want of salt;\r\nbut, by burning the outside of our mule steaks, and sprinkling a little\r\ngunpowder upon them, it did not require a very extensive stretch of the\r\nimagination to fancy the presence of both salt and pepper. We tried the\r\nmeat of horse, colt, and mules, all of which were in a starved\r\ncondition, and of course not very tender, juicy, or nutritious. We\r\nconsumed the enormous amount of from five to six pounds of this meat\r\nper man daily, but continued to grow weak and thin, until, at the\r\nexpiration of twelve days, we were able to perform but little labor,\r\nand were continually craving for fat meat.\r\n\r\nThe allowance of provisions for each grown person, to make the journey\r\nfrom the Missouri River to California, should suffice for 110 days. The\r\nfollowing is deemed requisite, viz.: 150 lbs. of flour, or its\r\nequivalent in hard bread; 25 lbs. of bacon or pork, and enough fresh\r\nbeef to be driven on the hoof to make up the meat component of the\r\nration; 15 lbs. of coffee, and 25 lbs. of sugar; also a quantity of\r\nsaleratus or yeast powders for making bread, and salt and pepper.\r\n\r\nThese are the chief articles of subsistence necessary for the trip, and\r\nthey should be used with economy, reserving a good portion for the\r\nwestern half of the journey. Heretofore many of the California\r\nemigrants have improvidently exhausted their stocks of provisions\r\nbefore reaching their journey's end, and have, in many cases, been\r\nobliged to pay the most exorbitant prices in making up the deficiency.\r\n\r\nIt is true that if persons choose to pass through Salt Lake City, and\r\nthe Mormons _happen_ to be in an amiable mood, supplies may sometimes\r\nbe procured from them; but those who have visited them well know how\r\nlittle reliance is to be placed upon their hospitality or spirit of\r\naccommodation.\r\n\r\nI once traveled with a party of New Yorkers _en route_ for California.\r\nThey were perfectly ignorant of every thing relating to this kind of\r\ncampaigning, and had overloaded their wagons with almost every thing\r\nexcept the very articles most important and necessary; the consequence\r\nwas, that they exhausted their teams, and were obliged to throw away\r\nthe greater part of their loading. They soon learned that Champagne,\r\nEast India sweetmeats, olives, etc., etc., were not the most useful\r\narticles for a prairie tour.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOTHING.\r\n\r\nA suitable dress for prairie traveling is of great import to health and\r\ncomfort. Cotton or linen fabrics do not sufficiently protect the body\r\nagainst the direct rays of the sun at midday, nor against rains or\r\nsudden changes of temperature. Wool, being a non-conductor, is the best\r\nmaterial for this mode of locomotion, and should always be adopted for\r\nthe plains. The coat should be short and stout, the shirt of red or\r\nblue flannel, such as can be found in almost all the shops on the\r\nfrontier: this, in warm weather, answers for an outside garment. The\r\npants should be of thick and soft woolen material, and it is well to\r\nhave them re-enforced on the inside, where they come in contact with\r\nthe saddle, with soft buckskin, which makes them more durable and\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\nWoolen socks and stout boots, coming up well at the knees, and made\r\nlarge, so as to admit the pants, will be found the best for horsemen,\r\nand they guard against rattlesnake bites.\r\n\r\nIn traveling through deep snow during very cold weather in winter,\r\nmoccasins are preferable to boots or shoes, as being more pliable, and\r\nallowing a freer circulation of the blood. In crossing the Rocky\r\nMountains in the winter, the weather being intensely cold, I wore two\r\npairs of woolen socks, and a square piece of thick blanket sufficient\r\nto cover the feet and ankles, over which were drawn a pair of thick\r\nbuckskin moccasins, and the whole enveloped in a pair of buffalo-skin\r\nboots with the hair inside, made open in the front and tied with\r\nbuckskin strings. At the same time I wore a pair of elkskin pants,\r\nwhich most effectually prevented the air from penetrating to the skin,\r\nand made an excellent defense against brush and thorns.\r\n\r\nMy men, who were dressed in the regulation clothing, wore out their\r\npants and shoes before we reached the summit of the mountains, and many\r\nof them had their feet badly frozen in consequence. They mended their\r\nshoes with pieces of leather cut from the saddle-skirts as long as they\r\nlasted, and, when this material was gone, they covered the entire shoe\r\nwith green beeve or mule hide, drawn together and sewed upon the top,\r\nwith the hair inside, which protected the upper as well as the sole\r\nleather. The sewing was done with an awl and buckskin strings. These\r\nsimple expedients contributed greatly to the comfort of the party; and,\r\nindeed, I am by no means sure that they did not, in our straitened\r\ncondition, without the transportation necessary for carrying disabled\r\nmen, save the lives of some of them. Without the awl and buckskins we\r\nshould have been unable to have repaired the shoes. They should never\r\nbe forgotten in making up the outfit for a prairie expedition.\r\n\r\nWe also experienced great inconvenience and pain by the reflection of\r\nthe sun's rays from the snow upon our eyes, and some of the party\r\nbecame nearly snow-blind. Green or blue glasses, inclosed in a wire\r\nnet-work, are an effectual protection to the eyes; but, in the absence\r\nof these, the skin around the eyes and upon the nose should be\r\nblackened with wet powder or charcoal, which will afford great relief.\r\n\r\nIn the summer season shoes are much better for footmen than boots, as\r\nthey are lighter, and do not cramp the ankles; the soles should be\r\nbroad, so as to allow a square, firm tread, without distorting or\r\npinching the feet.\r\n\r\nThe following list of articles is deemed a sufficient outfit for one\r\nman upon a three months' expedition, viz.:\r\n\r\n    2 blue or red flannel overshirts, open in front, with buttons.\r\n    2 woolen undershirts.\r\n    2 pairs thick cotton drawers.\r\n    4 pairs woolen socks.\r\n    2 pairs cotton socks.\r\n    4 colored silk handkerchiefs.\r\n    2 pairs stout shoes, for footmen.\r\n    1 pair boots, for horsemen.\r\n    1 pair shoes, for horsemen.\r\n    3 towels.\r\n    1 gutta percha poncho.\r\n    1 broad-brimmed hat of soft felt.\r\n    1 comb and brush.\r\n    2 tooth-brushes.\r\n    1 pound Castile soap.\r\n    3 pounds bar soap for washing   clothes.\r\n    1 belt-knife and small whetstone.\r\n    Stout linen thread, large needles, a bit of beeswax, a few\r\n      buttons, paper of pins, and a thimble, all contained in\r\n      a small buckskin or stout cloth bag.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing articles, with the coat and overcoat, complete the\r\nwardrobe.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMP EQUIPAGE.\r\n\r\nThe bedding for each person should consist of two blankets, a\r\ncomforter, and a pillow, and a gutta percha or painted canvas cloth to\r\nspread beneath the bed upon the ground, and to contain it when rolled\r\nup for transportation.\r\n\r\nEvery mess of six or eight persons will require a wrought-iron camp\r\nkettle, large enough for boiling meat and making soup; a coffee-pot and\r\ncups of heavy tin, with the handles riveted on; tin plates, frying and\r\nbake pans of wrought iron, the latter for baking bread and roasting\r\ncoffee. Also a mess pan of heavy tin or wrought iron for mixing bread\r\nand other culinary purposes; knives, forks, and spoons; an extra camp\r\nkettle; tin or gutta percha bucket for water--wood, being liable to\r\nshrink and fall to pieces, is not deemed suitable; an axe, hatchet, and\r\nspade will also be needed, with a mallet for driving picket-pins.\r\nMatches should be carried in bottles and corked tight, so as to exclude\r\nthe moisture.\r\n\r\nA little blue mass, quinine, opium, and some cathartic medicine, put up\r\nin doses for adults, will suffice for the medicine-chest.\r\n\r\nEach ox wagon should be provided with a covered tar-bucket, filled with\r\na mixture of tar or resin and grease, two bows extra, six S's, and six\r\nopen links for repairing chains. Every set of six wagons should have a\r\ntongue, coupling pole, king-bolt, and pair of hounds extra.\r\n\r\nEvery set of six mule wagons should be furnished with five pairs of\r\nhames, two double trees, four whipple-trees, and two pairs of lead bars\r\nextra.\r\n\r\nTwo lariats will be needed for every horse and mule, as one generally\r\nwears out before reaching the end of a long journey. They will be found\r\nuseful in crossing deep streams, and in letting wagons down steep hills\r\nand mountains; also in repairing broken wagons. Lariats made of hemp\r\nare the best.\r\n\r\nOne of the most indispensable articles to the outfit of the prairie\r\ntraveler is buckskin. For repairing harness, saddles, bridles, and\r\nnumerous other purposes of daily necessity, the awl and buckskin will\r\nbe found in constant requisition.\r\n\r\n\r\nARMS.\r\n\r\nEvery man who goes into the Indian country should be armed with a rifle\r\nand revolver, and he should never, either in camp or out of it, lose\r\nsight of them. When not on the march, they should be placed in such a\r\nposition that they can be seized at an instant's warning; and when\r\nmoving about outside the camp, the revolver should invariably be worn\r\nin the belt, as the person does not know at what moment he may have use\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nA great diversity of opinion obtains regarding the kind of rifle that\r\nis the most efficient and best adapted to Indian warfare, and the\r\nquestion is perhaps as yet very far from being settled to the\r\nsatisfaction of all. A large majority of men prefer the breech-loading\r\narm, but there are those who still adhere tenaciously to the\r\nold-fashioned muzzle-loading rifle as preferable to any of the modern\r\ninventions. Among these may be mentioned the border hunters and\r\nmountaineers, who can not be persuaded to use any other than the\r\nHawkins rifle, for the reason that they know nothing about the merits\r\nof any others. My own experience has forced me to the conclusion that\r\nthe breech-loading arm possesses great advantages over the\r\nmuzzle-loading, for the reason that it can be charged and fired with\r\nmuch greater rapidity.\r\n\r\nColt's revolving pistol is very generally admitted, both in Europe and\r\nAmerica, to be the most efficient arm of its kind known at the present\r\nday. As the same principles are involved in the fabrication of his\r\nbreech-loading rifle as are found in the pistol, the conviction to me\r\nis irresistible that, if one arm is worthy of consideration, the other\r\nis equally so. For my own part, I look upon Colt's new patent rifle as\r\na most excellent arm for border service. It gives six shots in more\r\nrapid succession than any other rifle I know of, and these, if properly\r\nexpended, are oftentimes sufficient to decide a contest; moreover, it\r\nis the most reliable and certain weapon to fire that I have ever used,\r\nand I can not resist the force of my conviction that, if I were alone\r\nupon the prairies, and expected an attack from a body of Indians, I am\r\nnot acquainted with any arm I would as soon have in my hands as this.\r\n\r\nThe army and navy revolvers have both been used in our army, but the\r\nofficers are not united in opinion in regard to their relative merits.\r\nI prefer the large army size, for reasons which will be given\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMarching.

Corraling\r\nWagons.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCHING.\r\n\r\nThe success of a long expedition through an unpopulated country depends\r\nmainly on the care taken of the animals, and the manner in which they\r\nare driven, herded, and guarded. If they are broken down or lost, every\r\nthing must be sacrificed, and the party becomes perfectly helpless.\r\n\r\nThe great error into which inexperienced travelers are liable to fall,\r\nand which probably occasions more suffering and disaster than almost\r\nany thing else, lies in overworking their cattle at the commencement of\r\nthe journey. To obviate this, short and easy drives should be made\r\nuntil the teams become habituated to their work, and gradually inured\r\nto this particular method of traveling. If animals are overloaded and\r\noverworked when they first start out into the prairies, especially if\r\nthey have recently been taken from grain, they soon fall away, and give\r\nout before reaching the end of the journey.\r\n\r\nGrass and water are abundant and good upon the eastern portions of all\r\nthe different overland routes; animals should not, therefore, with\r\nproper care, fall away in the least before reaching the mountains, as\r\nwest of them are long stretches where grass and water are scarce, and\r\nit requires the full amount of strength and vigor of animals in good\r\ncondition to endure the fatigues and hard labor attendant upon the\r\npassage of these deserts. Drivers should be closely watched, and never,\r\nunless absolutely necessary, permitted to beat their animals, or to\r\nforce them out of a walk, as this will soon break down the best teams.\r\nThose teamsters who make the least use of the whip invariably keep\r\ntheir animals in the best condition. Unless the drivers are checked at\r\nthe outset, they are very apt to fall into the habit of flogging their\r\nteams. It is not only wholly unnecessary but cruel, and should never be\r\ntolerated.\r\n\r\nIn traveling with ox teams in the summer season, great benefit will be\r\nderived from making early marches; starting with the dawn, and making a\r\n\"nooning\" during the heat of the day, as oxen suffer much from the heat\r\nof the sun in midsummer. These noon halts should, if possible, be so\r\narranged as to be near grass and water, where the animals can improve\r\ntheir time in grazing. When it gets cool they may be hitched to the\r\nwagons again, and the journey continued in the afternoon. Sixteen or\r\neighteen miles a day may thus be made without injury to the beasts, and\r\nlonger drives can never be expedient, unless in order to reach grass or\r\nwater. When the requisites for encamping can not be found at the\r\ndesired intervals, it is better for the animals to make a very long\r\ndrive than to encamp without water or grass. The noon halt in such\r\ncases may be made without water, and the evening drive lengthened.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of water upon some of the routes across the plains\r\noccasionally exposes the traveler to intense suffering, and renders it\r\na matter of much importance for him to learn the best methods of\r\nguarding against the disasters liable to occur to men and animals in\r\nthe absence of this most necessary element.\r\n\r\nIn mountainous districts water can generally be found either in\r\nsprings, the dry beds of streams, or in holes in the rocks, where they\r\nare sheltered from rapid evaporation. For example, in the Hueco tanks,\r\nthirty miles east of El Paso, New Mexico, upon the Fort Smith road,\r\nwhere there is an immense reservoir in a cave, water can always be\r\nfound. This reservoir receives the drainage of a mountain.\r\n\r\nDuring a season of the year when there are occasional showers, water\r\nwill generally be found in low places where there is a substratum of\r\nclay, but after the dry season has set in these pools evaporate, and it\r\nis necessary to dig wells. The lowest spots should be selected for this\r\npurpose when the grass is green and the surface earth moist.\r\n\r\nIn searching for water along the dry sandy beds of streams, it is well\r\nto try the earth with a stick or ramrod, and if this indicates moisture\r\nwater will generally be obtained by excavation. Streams often sink in\r\nlight and porous sand, and sometimes make their appearance again lower\r\ndown, where the bed is more tenacious; but it is a rule with prairie\r\ntravelers, in searching for water in a sandy country, to ascend the\r\nstreams, and the nearer their sources are approached the more water\r\nwill be found in a dry season.\r\n\r\nWhere it becomes necessary to sink a well in a stream the bed of which\r\nis quicksand, a flour-barrel, perforated with small holes, should be\r\nused as a curb, to prevent the sand from caving in. The barrel must be\r\nforced down as the sand is removed; and when, as is often the case,\r\nthere is an undercurrent through the sand, the well will be continually\r\nfilled with water.\r\n\r\nThere are many indications of water known to old campaigners, although\r\nnone of them are absolutely infallible. The most certain of them are\r\ndeep green cottonwood or willow trees growing in depressed localities;\r\nalso flags, water-rushes, tall green grass, etc.\r\n\r\nThe fresh tracks and trails of animals converging toward a common\r\ncentre, and the flight of birds and water-fowl toward the same points,\r\nwill also lead to water. In a section frequented by deer or mustangs,\r\nit may be certain that water is not far distant, as these animals drink\r\ndaily, and they will not remain long in a locality after the water has\r\ndried up. Deer generally go to water during the middle of the day, but\r\nbirds toward evening.\r\n\r\nA supply of drinking water may be obtained during a shower from the\r\ndrippings of a tent, or by suspending a cloth or blanket by the four\r\ncorners and hanging a small weight to the centre, so as to allow all\r\nthe rain to run toward one point, from whence it drops into a vessel\r\nbeneath. India-rubber, gutta-percha, or painted canvas cloths answer a\r\nvery good purpose for catching water during a rain, but they should be\r\npreviously well washed, to prevent them from imparting a bad taste.\r\n\r\nWhen there are heavy dews water may be collected by spreading out a\r\nblanket with a stick attached to one end, tying a rope to it, dragging\r\nit over the grass, and wringing out the water as it accumulates. In\r\nsome parts of Australia this method is practiced.\r\n\r\nIn traversing the country upon the head waters of Red River during the\r\nsummer of 1852, we suffered most severely from thirst, having nothing\r\nbut the acrid and bitter waters from the river, which, issuing from a\r\ngypsum formation, was highly charged with salts, and, when taken into\r\nthe stomach, did not quench thirst in the slightest degree, but, on the\r\ncontrary, produced a most painful and burning sensation, accompanied\r\nwith diarrhoea. During the four days that we were compelled to drink\r\nthis water the thermometer rose to 104 deg. in the shade, and the only\r\nrelief we found was from bathing in the river.\r\n\r\nThe use of water is a matter of habit, very much within our control, as\r\nby practice we may discipline ourselves so as to require but a small\r\namount. Some persons, for example, who place no restraint upon their\r\nappetites, will, if they can get it, drink water twenty times a day,\r\nwhile others will not perhaps drink more than once or twice during the\r\nsame time. I have found a very effectual preventive to thirst by\r\ndrinking a large quantity of water before breakfast, and, on feeling\r\nthirsty on the march, chewing a small green twig or leaf.\r\n\r\nWater taken from stagnant pools, charged with putrid vegetable matter\r\nand animalculae, would be very likely to generate fevers and dysenteries\r\nif taken into the stomach without purification. It should therefore be\r\nthoroughly boiled, and all the scum removed from the surface as it\r\nrises; this clarifies it, and by mixing powdered charcoal with it the\r\ndisinfecting process is perfected. Water may also be purified by\r\nplacing a piece of alum in the end of a stick that has been split, and\r\nstirring it around in a bucket of water. Charcoal and the leaves of the\r\nprickly pear are also used for the same purpose. I have recently seen a\r\ncompact and portable filter, made of charcoal, which clarifies the\r\nwater very effectually, and draws it off on the siphon principle. It\r\ncan be obtained at 85 West Street, New York, for one dollar and a half.\r\nWater may be partially filtered in a muddy pond by taking a barrel and\r\nboring the lower half full of holes, then filling it up with grass or\r\nmoss above the upper holes, after which it is placed in the pond with\r\nthe top above the surface. The water filters through the grass or moss,\r\nand rises in the barrel to a level with the pond. Travelers frequently\r\ndrink muddy water by placing a cloth or handkerchief over the mouth of\r\na cup to catch the larger particles of dirt and animalculae.\r\n\r\nWater may be cooled so as to be quite palatable by wrapping cloths\r\naround the vessels containing it, wetting them, and hanging them in the\r\nair, where a rapid evaporation will be produced. Some of the\r\nfrontier-men use a leathern sack for carrying water: this is porous,\r\nand allows the necessary evaporation without wetting.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs also use a leathern bottle, which they call _zemsemiyah_.\r\nWhen they are _en route_ they hang it on the shady side of a camel,\r\nwhere the evaporation keeps the water continually cool.\r\n\r\nNo expedition should ever set out into the plains without being\r\nsupplied with the means for carrying water, especially in an unknown\r\nregion. If wooden kegs are used they must frequently be looked after,\r\nand soaked, in order that they may not shrink and fall to pieces. Men,\r\nin marching in a hot climate, throw off a great amount of perspiration\r\nfrom the skin, and require a corresponding quantity of water to supply\r\nthe deficiency, and unless they get this they suffer greatly. When a\r\nparty makes an expedition into a desert section, where there is a\r\nprobability of finding no water, and intend to return over the same\r\ntrack, it is well to carry water as far as convenient, and bury it in\r\nthe ground for use on the return trip.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Sturt, when he explored Australia, took a tank in his cart,\r\nwhich burst, and, besides that, he carried casks of water. By these he\r\nwas enabled to face a desert country with a success which no traveler\r\nhad ever attained to. For instance, when returning homeward, the water\r\nwas found to be drying up from the country on all sides of him. He was\r\nat a pool, and the next stage was 118 miles, at the end of which it was\r\ndoubtful if there remained any water. It was necessary to send to\r\nreconnoitre, and to furnish the messenger with means of returning\r\nshould the pool be found dry. He killed a bullock, skinned it, and,\r\nfilling the skin with water (which held 150 gallons), sent it by an ox\r\ndray 30 miles, with orders to bury it and to return. Shortly after he\r\ndispatched a light one-horse cart, carrying 36 gallons of water; the\r\nhorse and man were to drink at the hide and go on. Thus they had 36\r\ngallons to supply them for a journey of 176 miles, or six days at 30\r\nmiles a day, at the close of which they would return to the ox\r\nhide--sleeping, in fact, five nights on 36 gallons of water. This a\r\nhardy, well-driven horse could do, even in the hottest climate.\"[2]\r\n\r\n      [2] F. Galton's _Art of Travel_, p. 17 and 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOURNADAS.\r\n\r\nIn some localities 50 or 60 miles, and even greater distances, are\r\nfrequently traversed without water; these long stretches are called by\r\nthe Mexicans \"_journadas_,\" or day's journeys. There is one in New\r\nMexico called _Journada del Muerto_, which is 78-1/2 miles in length,\r\nwhere, in a dry season, there is not a drop of water; yet, with proper\r\ncare, this drive can be made with ox or mule teams, and without loss or\r\ninjury to the animals.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the last camping-ground before entering upon the\r\njournada, all the animals should be as well rested and refreshed as\r\npossible. To insure this, they must be turned out upon the best grass\r\nthat can be found, and allowed to eat and drink as much as they desire\r\nduring the entire halt. Should the weather be very warm, and the teams\r\ncomposed of oxen, the march should not be resumed until it begins to\r\ncool in the afternoon. They should be carefully watered just previous\r\nto being hitched up and started out upon the journada, the water-kegs\r\nhaving been previously filled. The drive is then commenced, and\r\ncontinued during the entire night, with 10 or 15 minutes rest every two\r\nhours. About daylight a halt should be made, and the animals\r\nimmediately turned out to graze for two hours, during which time,\r\nespecially if there is dew upon the grass, they will have become\r\nconsiderably refreshed, and may be put to the wagons again and driven\r\nuntil the heat becomes oppressive toward noon, when they are again\r\nturned out upon a spot where the grass is good, and, if possible, where\r\nthere are shade trees. About four o'clock P.M. they are again started,\r\nand the march continued into the night, and as long as they can be\r\ndriven without suffering. If, however, there should be dew, which is\r\nseldom the case on the plains, it would be well to turn out the animals\r\nseveral times during the second night, and by morning, if they are in\r\ngood condition, the journada of 70 or 80 miles will have been passed\r\nwithout any great amount of suffering. I am supposing, in this case,\r\nthat the road is firm and free from sand.\r\n\r\nMany persons have been under the impression that animals, in traversing\r\nthe plains, would perform better and keep in better condition by\r\nallowing them to graze in the morning before commencing the day's\r\nmarch, which involves the necessity of making late starts, and driving\r\nduring the heat of the day. The same persons have been of the opinion\r\nthat animals will graze only at particular hours; that the remainder of\r\nthe day must be allowed them for rest and sleep, and that, unless these\r\nrules be observed, they would not thrive. This opinion is, however,\r\nerroneous, as animals will in a few days adapt themselves to any\r\ncircumstances, so far as regards their hours of labor, rest, and\r\nrefreshment. If they have been accustomed to work at particular periods\r\nof the day, and the order of things is suddenly reversed, the working\r\nhours changed into hours of rest, and _vice versa_, they may not do as\r\nwell for a short time, but they will soon accustom themselves to the\r\nchange, and eat and rest as well as before. By making early drives\r\nduring the summer months the heat of the day is avoided, whereas, I\r\nrepeat, if allowed to graze before starting, the march can not commence\r\nuntil it grows warm, when animals, especially oxen, will suffer greatly\r\nfrom the heat of the sun, and will not do as well as when the other\r\nplan is pursued.\r\n\r\nOxen upon a long journey will sometimes wear down their hoofs and\r\nbecome lame. When this occurs, a thick piece of raw hide wrapped around\r\nthe foot and tied firmly to the leg will obviate the difficulty,\r\nprovided the weather is not wet; for if so, the shoe soon wears out.\r\nMexican and Indian horses and mules will make long journeys without\r\nbeing shod, as their hoofs are tough and elastic, and wear away very\r\ngradually; they will, however, in time become very smooth, making it\r\ndifficult for them to travel upon grass.\r\n\r\nA train of wagons should always be kept closed upon a march; and if, as\r\noften happens, a particular wagon gets out of order and is obliged to\r\nhalt, it should be turned out of the road, to let the others pass while\r\nthe injury is being repaired. As soon as the broken wagon is in order,\r\nit should fall into the line wherever it happens to be. In the event of\r\na wagon breaking down so as to require important repairs, men should be\r\nimmediately dispatched with the necessary tools and materials, which\r\nshould be placed in the train where they can readily be got at, and a\r\nguard should be left to escort the wagon to camp after having been\r\nrepaired. If, however, the damage be so serious as to require any great\r\nlength of time to repair it, the load should be transferred to other\r\nwagons, so that the team which is left behind will be able to travel\r\nrapidly and overtake the train.\r\n\r\nIf the broken wagon is a poor one, and there be abundance of better\r\nones, the accident being such as to involve much delay for its repair,\r\nit may be wise to abandon it, taking from it such parts as may possibly\r\nbe wanted in repairing other wagons.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANCE AND REAR GUARDS.\r\n\r\nA few men, well mounted, should constitute the advance and rear guards\r\nfor each train of wagons passing through the Indian country. Their duty\r\nwill be to keep a vigilant look-out in all directions, and to\r\nreconnoitre places where Indians would be likely to lie in ambush.\r\nShould hostile Indians be discovered, the fact should be at once\r\nreported to the commander, who (if he anticipates an attack) will\r\nrapidly form his wagons into a circle or \"_corral_,\" with the animals\r\ntoward the centre, and the men on the inside, with their arms in\r\nreadiness to repel an attack from without. If these arrangements be\r\nproperly attended to, few parties of Indians will venture to make an\r\nattack, as they are well aware that some of their warriors might pay\r\nwith their lives the forfeit of such indiscretion.\r\n\r\nI know an instance where one resolute man, pursued for several days by\r\na large party of Comanches on the Santa Fe trace, defended himself by\r\ndismounting and pointing his rifle at the foremost whenever they came\r\nnear him, which always had the effect of turning them back. This was\r\nrepeated so often that the Indians finally abandoned the pursuit, and\r\nleft the traveler to pursue his journey without farther molestation.\r\nDuring all this time he did not discharge his rifle; had he done so he\r\nwould doubtless have been killed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF CAMPS.\r\n\r\nThe security of animals, and, indeed, the general safety of a party, in\r\ntraveling through a country occupied by hostile Indians, depends\r\ngreatly upon the judicious selection of camps. One of the most\r\nimportant considerations that should influence the choice of a locality\r\nis its capability for defense. If the camp be pitched beside a stream,\r\na concave bend, where the water is deep, with a soft alluvial bed\r\ninclosed by high and abrupt banks, will be the most defensible, and all\r\nthe more should the concavity form a peninsula. The advantages of such\r\na position are obvious to a soldier's eye, as that part of the\r\nencampment inclosed by the stream is naturally secure, and leaves only\r\none side to be defended. The concavity of the bend will enable the\r\ndefending party to cross its fire in case of attack from the exposed\r\nside. The bend of the stream will also form an excellent corral in\r\nwhich to secure animals from a stampede, and thereby diminish the\r\nnumber of sentinels needful around the camp. In herding animals at\r\nnight within the bend of a stream, a spot should be selected where no\r\nclumps of brush grow on the side where the animals are posted. If\r\nthickets of brush can not be avoided, sentinels should be placed near\r\nthem, to guard against Indians, who might take advantage of this cover\r\nto steal animals, or shoot them down with arrows, before their presence\r\nwere known.\r\n\r\nIn camping away from streams, it is advisable to select a position in\r\nwhich one or more sides of the encampment shall rest upon the crest of\r\nan abrupt hill or bluff. The prairie Indians make their camps upon the\r\nsummits of the hills, whence they can see in all directions, and thus\r\navoid a surprise.\r\n\r\nThe line of tents should be pitched on that side of the camp most\r\nexposed to attack, and sentinels so posted that they may give alarm in\r\ntime for the main body to rally and prepare for defense.\r\n\r\n\r\nSANITARY CONSIDERATIONS.\r\n\r\nWhen camping near rivers and lakes surrounded by large bodies of timber\r\nand a luxuriant vegetation, which produces a great amount of\r\ndecomposition and consequent exhalations of malaria, it is important to\r\nascertain what localities will be the least likely to generate disease,\r\nand to affect the sanitary condition of men occupying them.\r\n\r\nThis subject has been thoroughly examined by Dr. Robert Johnson,\r\nInspector General of Hospitals in the English army in 1845; and, as his\r\nconclusions are deduced from enlarged experience and extended research,\r\nthey should have great weight. I shall therefore make no apology for\r\nintroducing here a few extracts from his interesting report touching\r\nupon this subject:\r\n\r\n\"It is consonant with the experience of military people, in all ages\r\nand in all countries, that camp diseases most abound near the muddy\r\nbanks of large rivers, near swamps and ponds, and on grounds which have\r\nbeen recently stripped of their woods. The fact is precise, but it has\r\nbeen set aside to make way for an opinion. It was assumed, about half a\r\ncentury since, by a celebrated army physician, that camp diseases\r\noriginated from causes of putrefaction, and that putrefaction is\r\nconnected radically with a stagnant condition of the air.\r\n\r\n\"As streams of air usually proceed along rivers with more certainty and\r\nforce than in other places, and as there is evidently a more certain\r\nmovement of air, that is, more wind on open grounds than among woods\r\nand thickets, this sole consideration, without any regard to\r\nexperience, influenced opinion, gave currency to the destructive maxim\r\nthat the banks of rivers, open grounds, and exposed heights are the\r\nmost eligible situations for the encampment of troops. They are the\r\nbest ventilated; they must, if the theory be true, be the most healthy.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is the reverse; but, demonstrative as the fact may be,\r\nfashion has more influence than multiplied examples of fact\r\nexperimentally proved. Encampments are still formed in the vicinity of\r\nswamps, or on grounds which are newly cleared of their woods, in\r\nobedience to theory, and contrary to fact.\r\n\r\n\"It is prudent, as now said, in _selecting ground for encampment_, to\r\navoid the immediate vicinity of swamps and rivers. The air is there\r\nnoxious; but, as its influence thence originating does not extend\r\nbeyond a certain limit, it is a matter of some importance to ascertain\r\nto what distance it does extend; because, if circumstances do not\r\npermit that the encampment be removed out of its reach, prudence\r\ndirects that remedies be applied to weaken the force of its pernicious\r\nimpressions.\r\n\r\n\"The remedies consist in the interposition of rising grounds, woods, or\r\nsuch other impediments as serve to break the current in its progress\r\nfrom the noxious source. It is an obvious fact, that the noxious cause,\r\nor the exhalation in which it is enveloped, ascends as it traverses the\r\nadjacent plain, and that its impression is augmented by the\r\nadventitious force with which it strikes upon the subject of its\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\"It is thus that a position of three hundred paces from the margin of a\r\nswamp, on a level with the swamp itself, or but moderately elevated, is\r\nless unhealthy than one at six hundred on the same line of direction on\r\nan exposed height. The cause here strikes fully in its ascent; and as\r\nthe atmosphere has a more varied temperature, and the succussions of\r\nthe air are more irregular on the height than on the plain, the\r\nimpression is more forcible, and the noxious effect more strongly\r\nmarked. In accord with this principle, it is almost uniformly true,\r\n_coeteris paribus_, that diseases are more common, at least more\r\nviolent, in broken, irregular, and hilly countries, where the\r\ntemperature is liable to sudden changes, and where blasts descend with\r\nfury from the mountains, than in large and extensive inclined plains\r\nunder the action of equal and gentle breezes only.\r\n\r\n\"From this fact it becomes an object of the first consideration, in\r\nselecting ground for encampment, to guard against the impression of\r\nstrong winds on their own account, independently of their proceeding\r\nfrom swamps, rivers, and noxious soils.\r\n\r\n\"It is proved by experience, in armies as in civil life, that injury\r\ndoes not often result from simple wetting with rain when the person is\r\nfairly exposed in the open air, and habitually inured to the\r\ncontingencies of weather. Irregular troops, which act in the advanced\r\nline of armies, and which have no other shelter from weather than a\r\nhedge or tree, rarely experience sickness--never, at least, the\r\nsickness which proceeds from contagion; hence it is inferred that the\r\nshelter of tents is not necessary for the preservation of health.\r\nIrregular troops, with contingent shelter only, are comparatively\r\nhealthy, while sickness often rages with violence in the same scene,\r\namong those who have all the protection against the inclemencies of\r\nweather which can be furnished by canvas. The fact is verified by\r\nexperience, and the cause of it is not of difficult explanation. When\r\nthe earth is damp, the action of heat on its surface occasions the\r\ninterior moisture to ascend. The heat of the bodies of a given number\r\nof men, confined within a tent of a given dimension, raises the\r\ntemperature within the tent beyond the temperature of the common air\r\noutside the tent. The ascent of moisture is thus encouraged, generally\r\nby a change of temperature in the tent, and more particularly by the\r\nimmediate or near contact of the heated bodies of the men with the\r\nsurface of the earth. Moisture, as exhaled from the earth, is\r\nconsidered by observers of fact to be a cause which acts injuriously on\r\nhealth. Produced artificially by the accumulation of individuals in\r\nclose tents, it may reasonably be supposed to produce its usual effects\r\non armies. A cause of contagious influence, of fatal effect, is thus\r\ngenerated by accumulating soldiers in close and crowded tents, under\r\nthe pretext of defending them from the inclemencies of the weather; and\r\nhence it is that the means which are provided for the preservation of\r\nhealth are actually the causes of destruction of life.\r\n\r\n\"There are two causes which more evidently act upon the health of\r\ntroops in the field than any other, namely, moisture exhaled direct\r\nfrom the surface of the earth in undue quantity, and emanations of a\r\npeculiar character arising from diseased action in the animal system in\r\na mass of men crowded together. These are principal, and they are\r\nimportant. The noxious effects may be obviated, or rather the noxious\r\ncause will not be generated, under the following arrangement, namely, a\r\ncarpet of painted canvas for the floor of the tent; a tent with a light\r\nroof, as defense against perpendicular rain or the rays of a vertical\r\nsun; and with side walls of moderate height, to be employed only\r\nagainst driving rains. To the first there can be no objection: it is\r\nuseful, as preventing the exhalations of moisture from the surface of\r\nthe earth; it is convenient, as always ready; and it is economical, as\r\nless expensive than straw. It requires to be fresh painted only once a\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of crowding men together in close quarters, illy ventilated,\r\nwas shown in the prisons of Hindostan, where at one time, when the\r\nEnglish held sway, they had, on an average, 40,000 natives in\r\nconfinement; and this unfortunate population was every year liberated\r\nby death in proportions varying from 4000 to 10,000. The annual average\r\nmortality by crowded and unventilated barracks in the English army has\r\nsometimes been enormous, as at Barrackpore, where it seldom fell far\r\nshort of one tenth; that is to say, its garrisons were every year\r\ndecimated by fever or cholera, while the officers and other\r\ninhabitants, who lived in well-ventilated houses, did not find the\r\nplace particularly unhealthy.\r\n\r\nThe same fact of general exemption among the officers, and complete\r\nexemption among their wives, was observed in the marching regiments,\r\nwhich lost by cholera from one tenth to one sixth of the enlisted men,\r\nwho were packed together at night ten and twelve in a tent, with the\r\nthermometer at 96 deg.. The dimensions of the celebrated Black Hole of\r\nCalcutta--where in 1756, 123 prisoners out of 140 died by carbonic acid\r\nin one night--was but eighteen feet square, and with but two small\r\nwindows. Most of the twenty-three who survived until morning were\r\nseized with putrid fever and died very soon afterward.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of December, 1848, 150 deck passengers of the steamer\r\nLondonderry were ordered below by the captain and the hatches closed\r\nupon them: seventy were found dead the next morning.\r\n\r\nThe streams which intersect our great prairies have but a very sparse\r\ngrowth of wood or vegetation upon their banks, so that one of the\r\nfundamental causes for the generation of noxious malaria does not, to\r\nany great extent, exist here, and I believe that persons may encamp\r\nwith impunity directly upon their banks.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICKET GUARDS.\r\n\r\nWhen a party is sufficiently strong, a picket guard should be stationed\r\nduring the night some two or three hundred yards in advance of the\r\npoint which is most open to assault, and on low ground, so that an\r\nenemy approaching over the surrounding higher country can be seen\r\nagainst the sky, while the sentinel himself is screened from\r\nobservation. These sentinels should not be allowed to keep fires,\r\nunless they are so placed that they can not be seen from a distance.\r\n\r\nDuring the day the pickets should be posted on the summits of the\r\nhighest eminences in the vicinity of camp, with instructions to keep a\r\nvigilant lookout in all directions; and, if not within hailing\r\ndistance, they should be instructed to give some well-understood\r\ntelegraphic signals to inform those in camp when there is danger. For\r\nexample, should Indians be discovered approaching at a great distance,\r\nthey may raise their caps upon the muzzles of their pieces, and at the\r\nsame time walk around in a circle; while, if the Indians are near and\r\nmoving rapidly, the sentinel may swing his cap and run around rapidly\r\nin a circle. To indicate the direction from which the Indians are\r\napproaching, he may direct his piece toward them, and walk in the same\r\nline of direction.\r\n\r\nShould the pickets suddenly discover a party of Indians very near, and\r\nwith the apparent intention of making an attack, they should fire their\r\npieces to give the alarm to the camp.\r\n\r\nThese telegraphic signals, when well understood and enforced, will tend\r\ngreatly to facilitate the communication of intelligence throughout the\r\ncamp, and conduce much to its security.\r\n\r\nThe picket guards should receive minute and strict orders regarding\r\ntheir duties under all circumstances, and these orders should be\r\ndistinctly understood by every one in the camp, so that no false alarms\r\nwill be created. All persons, with the exception of the guards and\r\nherders, should after dark be confined to the limits of the chain of\r\nsentinels, so that, if any one is seen approaching from without these\r\nlimits, it will be known that they are strangers.\r\n\r\nAs there will not often be occasion for any one to pass the chain of\r\npickets during the night, it is a good rule (especially if the party is\r\nsmall), when a picket sentinel discovers any one lurking about his post\r\nfrom without, if he has not himself been seen, to quietly withdraw and\r\nreport the fact to the commander, who can wake his men and make his\r\narrangements to repel an attack and protect his animals. If, however,\r\nthe man upon the picket has been seen, he should distinctly challenge\r\nthe approaching party, and if he receives no answer, fire, and retreat\r\nto camp to report the fact.\r\n\r\nIt is of the utmost importance that picket guards should be wide awake,\r\nand allow nothing to escape their observation, as the safety of the\r\nwhole camp is involved. During a dark night a man can see better\r\nhimself, and is less exposed to the view of others, when in a sitting\r\nposture than when standing up or moving about. I would therefore\r\nrecommend this practice for night pickets.\r\n\r\nHorses and mules (especially the latter), whose senses of hearing and\r\nsmelling are probably more acute than those of almost any other\r\nanimals, will discover any thing strange or unusual about camp much\r\nsooner than a man. They indicate this by turning in the direction from\r\nwhence the object is approaching, holding their heads erect, projecting\r\ntheir ears forward, and standing in a fixed and attentive attitude.\r\nThey exhibit the same signs of alarm when a wolf or other wild animal\r\napproaches the camp; but it is always wise, when they show fear in this\r\nmanner, to be on the alert till the cause is ascertained.\r\n\r\nMules are very keenly sensitive to danger, and, in passing along over\r\nthe prairies, they will often detect the proximity of strangers long\r\nbefore they are discovered by their riders. Nothing seems to escape\r\ntheir observation; and I have heard of several instances where they\r\nhave given timely notice of the approach of hostile Indians, and thus\r\nprevented stampedes.\r\n\r\nDogs are sometimes good sentinels, but they often sleep sound, and are\r\nnot easily awakened on the approach of an enemy.\r\n\r\nIn marching with large force, unless there is a guide who knows the\r\ncountry, a small party should always be sent in advance to search for\r\ngood camping-places, and these parties should be dispatched early\r\nenough to return and meet the main command in the event of not finding\r\na camping-place within the limits of the day's march. A regiment should\r\naverage upon the prairies, where the roads are good, about eighteen\r\nmiles a day, but, if necessary, it can make 25 or even 30 miles. The\r\nadvance party should therefore go as far as the command can march,\r\nprovided the requisites for camping are not found within that distance.\r\nThe article of first importance in campaigning is grass, the next\r\nwater, and the last fuel.\r\n\r\nIt is the practice of most persons traveling with large ox trains to\r\nselect their camps upon the summit of a hill, where the surrounding\r\ncountry in all directions can be seen. Their cattle are then\r\ncontinually within view from the camp, and can be guarded easily.\r\n\r\nWhen a halt is made the wagons are \"corraled,\" as it is called, by\r\nbringing the two front ones near and parallel to each other. The two\r\nnext are then driven up on the outside of these, with the front wheels\r\nof the former touching the rear wheels of the latter, the rear of the\r\nwagons turned out upon the circumference of the circle that is being\r\nformed, and so on until one half the circle is made, when the rear of\r\nthe wagons are turned in to complete the circle. An opening of about\r\ntwenty yards should be left between the last two wagons for animals to\r\npass in and out of the corral, and this may be closed with two ropes\r\nstretched between the wagons. Such a corral forms an excellent and\r\nsecure barricade against Indian attacks, and a good inclosure for\r\ncattle while they are being yoked; indeed, it is indispensable.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAMPEDES.\r\n\r\nInclosures are made in the same manner for horses and mules, and, in\r\ncase of an attempt to stampede them, they should be driven with all\r\npossible dispatch into the corral, where they will be perfectly secure.\r\nA \"stampede\" is more to be dreaded upon the plains than almost any\r\ndisaster that can happen. It not unfrequently occurs that very many\r\nanimals are irretrievably lost in this way, and the objects of an\r\nexpedition thus defeated.\r\n\r\nThe Indians are perfectly familiar with the habits and disposition of\r\nhorses and mules, and with the most effectual methods of terrifying\r\nthem. Previous to attempting a stampede, they provide themselves with\r\nrattles and other means for making frightful noises; thus prepared,\r\nthey approach as near the herds as possible without being seen, and\r\nsuddenly, with their horses at full speed, rush in among them, making\r\nthe most hideous and unearthly screams and noises to terrify them, and\r\ndrive them off before their astonished owners are able to rally and\r\nsecure them.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the animals are started the Indians divide their party,\r\nleaving a portion to hurry them off rapidly, while the rest linger some\r\ndistance in the rear, to resist those who may pursue them.\r\n\r\nHorses and mules will sometimes, especially in the night, become\r\nfrightened and stampeded from very slight causes. A wolf or a deer\r\npassing through a herd will often alarm them, and cause them to break\r\naway in the most frantic manner. Upon one occasion in the Choctaw\r\ncountry, my entire herd of about two hundred horses and mules all\r\nstampeded in the night, and scattered over the country for many miles,\r\nand it was several days before I succeeded in collecting them together.\r\nThe alarm occurred while the herders were walking among the animals,\r\nand without any perceptible cause. The foregoing facts go to show how\r\nimportant it is at all times to keep a vigilant guard over animals. In\r\nthe vicinity of hostile Indians, where an attack may be anticipated,\r\nseveral good horses should be secured in such positions that they will\r\ncontinually be in readiness for an emergency of this kind. The herdsmen\r\nshould have their horses in hand, saddled and bridled, and ready at an\r\ninstant's notice to spring upon their backs and drive the herds into\r\ncamp. As soon as it is discovered that the animals have taken fright,\r\nthe herdsmen should use their utmost endeavors to turn them in the\r\ndirection of the camp, and this can generally be accomplished by riding\r\nthe bell mare in front of the herd, and gradually turning her toward\r\nit, and slackening her speed as the familiar objects about the camp\r\ncome in sight. This usually tends to quiet their alarm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nRepairing broken Wagons. Fording Rivers. Quicksand. Wagon Boats. Bull\r\nBoats. Crossing Packs. Swimming Animals. Marching with loose Horses.\r\nHerding Mules. Best Methods of Marching. Herding and guarding Animals.\r\nDescending Mountains. Storms. Northers.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPAIRS OF ACCIDENTS.\r\n\r\nThe accidents most liable to happen to wagons on the plains arise from\r\nthe great dryness of the atmosphere, and the consequent shrinkage and\r\ncontraction of the wood-work in the wheels, the tires working loose,\r\nand the wheels, in passing over sidling ground, oftentimes falling down\r\nand breaking all the spokes where they enter the hub. It therefore\r\nbecomes a matter of absolute necessity for the prairie traveler to\r\ndevise some means of repairing such damages, or of guarding against\r\nthem by the use of timely expedients.\r\n\r\nThe wheels should be frequently and closely examined, and whenever a\r\ntire becomes at all loose it should at once be tightened with pieces of\r\nhoop-iron or wooden wedges driven by twos simultaneously from opposite\r\nsides. Another remedy for the same thing is to take off the wheels\r\nafter encamping, sink them in water, and allow them to remain over\r\nnight. This swells the wood, but is only temporary, requiring frequent\r\nrepetition; and, after a time, if the wheels have not been made of\r\nthoroughly seasoned timber, it becomes necessary to reset the tires in\r\norder to guard against their destruction by falling to pieces and\r\nbreaking the spokes.\r\n\r\nIf the tires run off near a blacksmith's shop, or if there be a\r\ntraveling forge with the train, they may be tied on with raw hide or\r\nropes, and thus driven to the shop or camp. When a rear wheel breaks\r\ndown upon a march, the best method I know of for taking the vehicle to\r\na place where it can be repaired is to take off the damaged wheel, and\r\nplace a stout pole of three or four inches in diameter under the end of\r\nthe axle, outside the wagon-bed, and extending forward above the front\r\nwheel, where it is firmly lashed with ropes, while the other end of the\r\npole runs six or eight feet to the rear, and drags upon the ground. The\r\npole must be of such length and inclination that the axle shall be\r\nraised and retained in its proper horizontal position, when it can be\r\ndriven to any distance that may be desired. The wagon should be\r\nrelieved as much as practicable of its loading, as the pole dragging\r\nupon the ground will cause it to run heavily.\r\n\r\nWhen a front wheel breaks down, the expedient just mentioned can not be\r\napplied to the front axle, but the two rear wheels may be taken off and\r\nplaced upon this axle (they will always fit), while the sound front\r\nwheel can be substituted upon one side of the rear axle, after which\r\nthe pole may be applied as before described. This plan I have adopted\r\nupon several different occasions, and I can vouch for its efficacy.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing facts may appear very simple and unimportant in\r\nthemselves, but blacksmiths and wheelwrights are not met with at every\r\nturn of the roads upon the prairies; and in the wilderness, where the\r\ntraveler is dependent solely upon his own resources, this kind of\r\ninformation will be found highly useful.\r\n\r\nWhen the spokes in a wheel shrink more than the felloes, they work\r\nloose in the hub, and can not be tightened by wedging. The only remedy\r\nin such cases is to cut the felloe with a saw on opposite sides, taking\r\nout two pieces of such dimensions that the reduced circumference will\r\ndraw back the spokes into their proper places and make them snug. A\r\nthin wagon-bow, or barrel-hoops, may then be wrapped around the outside\r\nof the felloe, and secured with small nails or tacks. This increases\r\nthe diameter of the wheel, so that when the tire has been heated, put\r\non, and cooled, it forces back the spokes into their true places, and\r\nmakes the wheel as sound and strong as it ever was. This simple process\r\ncan be executed in about half an hour if there be fuel for heating, and\r\nobviates the necessity of cutting and welding the tire. I would\r\nrecommend that the tires should be secured with bolts and nuts, which\r\nwill prevent them from running off when they work loose, and, if they\r\nhave been cut and reset, they should be well tried with a hammer where\r\nthey are welded to make sure that the junction is sound.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORDING RIVERS.\r\n\r\nMany streams that intersect the different routes across our continent\r\nare broad and shallow, and flow over beds of quicksand, which, in\r\nseasons of high water, become boggy and unstable, and are then\r\nexceedingly difficult of crossing. When these streams are on the rise,\r\nand, indeed, before any swelling is perceptible, their beds become\r\nsurcharged with the sand loosened by the action of the under-current\r\nfrom the approaching flood, and from this time until the water subsides\r\nfording is difficult, requiring great precautions.\r\n\r\nOn arriving upon the bank of a river of this character which has not\r\nrecently been crossed, the condition of the quicksand may be\r\nascertained by sending an intelligent man over the fording-place, and,\r\nshould the sand not yield under his feet, it may be regarded as safe\r\nfor animals or wagons. Should it, however, prove soft and yielding, it\r\nmust be thoroughly examined, and the best track selected. This can be\r\ndone by a man on foot, who will take a number of sharp sticks long\r\nenough, when driven into the bottom of the river, to stand above the\r\nsurface of the water. He starts from the shore, and with one of the\r\nsticks and his feet tries the bottom in the direction of the opposite\r\nbank until he finds the firmest ground, where he plants one of the\r\nsticks to mark the track. A man incurs no danger in walking over\r\nquicksand provided he step rapidly, and he will soon detect the safest\r\nground. He then proceeds, planting his sticks as often as may be\r\nnecessary to mark the way, until he reaches the opposite bank. The ford\r\nis thus ascertained, and, if there are footmen in the party, they\r\nshould cross before the animals and wagons, as they pack the sand, and\r\nmake the track more firm and secure.\r\n\r\nIf the sand is soft, horses should be led across, and not allowed to\r\nstop in the stream; and the better to insure this, they should be\r\nwatered before entering upon the ford; otherwise, as soon as they stand\r\nstill, their feet sink in the sand, and soon it becomes difficult to\r\nextricate them. The same rule holds in the passage of wagons: they must\r\nbe driven steadily across, and the animals never allowed to stop while\r\nin the river, as the wheels sink rapidly in quicksand. Mules will often\r\nstop from fear, and, when once embarrassed in the sand, they lie down,\r\nand will not use the slightest exertion to regain their footing. The\r\nonly alternative, then, is to drag them out with ropes. I have even\r\nknown some mules refuse to put forth the least exertion to get up after\r\nbeing pulled out upon firm ground, and it was necessary to set them\r\nupon their feet before they were restored to a consciousness of their\r\nown powers.\r\n\r\nIn crossing rivers where the water is so high as to come into the\r\nwagon-beds, but is not above a fording stage, the contents of the\r\nwagons may be kept dry by raising the beds between the uprights, and\r\nretaining them in that position with blocks of wood placed at each\r\ncorner between the rockers and the bottom of the wagon-beds. The blocks\r\nmust be squared at each end, and their length, of course, should vary\r\nwith the depth of water, which can be determined before cutting them.\r\nThis is a very common and simple method of passing streams among\r\nemigrant travelers.\r\n\r\nWhen streams are deep, with a very rapid current, it is difficult for\r\nthe drivers to direct their teams to the proper coming-out places, as\r\nthe current has a tendency to carry them too far down. This difficulty\r\nmay be obviated by attaching a lariat rope to the leading animals, and\r\nhaving a mounted man ride in front with the rope in his hand, to assist\r\nthe team in stemming the current, and direct it toward the point of\r\negress. It is also a wise precaution, if the ford be at all hazardous,\r\nto place a mounted man on the lower side of the team with a whip, to\r\nurge forward any animal that may not work properly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SWIMMING A HORSE.]\r\n\r\nWhere rivers are wide, with a swift current, they should always, if\r\npossible, be forded obliquely down stream, as the action of the water\r\nagainst the wagons assists very materially in carrying them across. In\r\ncrossing the North Platte upon the Cherokee trail at a season when the\r\nwater was high and very rapid, we were obliged to take the only\r\npracticable ford, which ran diagonally up the stream. The consequence\r\nwas, that the heavy current, coming down with great force against the\r\nwagons, offered such powerful resistance to the efforts of the mules\r\nthat it was with difficulty they could retain their footing, and\r\nseveral were drowned. Had the ford crossed obliquely down the river,\r\nthere would have been no difficulty.\r\n\r\nWhen it becomes necessary, with loaded wagons, to cross a stream of\r\nthis character against the current, I would recommend that the teams be\r\ndoubled, the leading animals led, a horseman placed on each side with\r\nwhips to assist the driver, and that, before the first wagon enters the\r\nwater, a man should be sent in advance to ascertain the best ford.\r\n\r\nDuring seasons of high water, men, in traversing the plains, often\r\nencounter rivers which rise above a fording stage, and remain in that\r\ncondition for many days, and to await the falling of the water might\r\ninvolve a great loss of time. If the traveler be alone, his only way is\r\nto swim his horse; but if he retains the seat on his saddle, his weight\r\npresses the animal down into the water, and cramps his movements very\r\nsensibly. It is a much better plan to attach a cord to the bridle-bit,\r\nand drive him into the stream; then, seizing his tail, allow him to tow\r\nyou across. If he turns out of the course, or attempts to turn back, he\r\ncan be checked with the cord, or by splashing water at his head. If the\r\nrider remains in the saddle, he should allow the horse to have a loose\r\nrein, and never pull upon it except when necessary to guide. If he\r\nwishes to steady himself, he can lay hold upon the mane.\r\n\r\nIn traveling with large parties, the following expedients for crossing\r\nrivers have been successfully resorted to within my own experience, and\r\nthey are attended with no risk to life or property.\r\n\r\nA rapid and deep stream, with high, abrupt, and soft banks, probably\r\npresents the most formidable array of unfavorable circumstances that\r\ncan be found. Streams of this character are occasionally met with, and\r\nit is important to know how to cross them with the greatest promptitude\r\nand safety.\r\n\r\nA train of wagons having arrived upon the bank of such a stream, first\r\nselect the best point for the passage, where the banks upon both sides\r\nrequire the least excavation for a place of ingress and egress to and\r\nfrom the river. As I have before remarked, the place of entering the\r\nriver should be above the coming-out place on the opposite bank, as the\r\ncurrent will then assist in carrying wagons and animals across. A spot\r\nshould be sought where the bed of the stream is firm at the place where\r\nthe animals are to get out on the opposite bank. If, however, no such\r\nplace can be found, brush and earth should be thrown in to make a\r\nfoundation sufficient to support the animals, and to prevent them from\r\nbogging. After the place for crossing has been selected, it will be\r\nimportant to determine the breadth of the river between the points of\r\ningress and egress, in order to show the length of rope necessary to\r\nreach across. A very simple practical method of doing this without\r\ninstruments is found in the French \"Manuel du Genie.\" It is as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The line AB (the distance to be measured) is extended\r\nupon the bank to D, from which point, after having marked it, lay off\r\nequal distances, DC and C_d_; produce BC to _b_, making CB=C_b_; then\r\nextend the line _db_ until it intersects the prolongation of the line\r\nthrough CA at _a_. The distance between _ab_ is equal to AB, or the\r\nwidth of the crossing.]\r\n\r\nA man who is an expert swimmer then takes the end of a fishing-line or\r\na small cord in his mouth, and carries it across, leaving the other end\r\nfixed upon the opposite bank, after which a lariat is attached to the\r\ncord, and one end of it pulled across and made fast to a tree; but if\r\nthere is nothing convenient to which the lariat can be attached, an\r\nextra axle or coupling-pole can be pulled over by the man who has\r\ncrossed, firmly planted in the ground, and the rope tied to it. The\r\nrope must be long enough to extend twice across the stream, so that one\r\nend may always be left on each shore. A very good substitute for a\r\nferry-boat may be made with a wagon-bed by filling it with empty\r\nwater-casks, stopped tight and secured in the wagon with ropes, with a\r\ncask lashed opposite the centre of each outside. It is then placed in\r\nthe water bottom upward, and the rope that has been stretched across\r\nthe stream attached to one end of it, while another rope is made fast\r\nto the other end, after which it is loaded, the shore-end loosened, and\r\nthe men on the opposite bank pull it across to the landing, where it is\r\ndischarged and returned for another load, and so on until all the\r\nbaggage and men are passed over.\r\n\r\nThe wagons can be taken across by fastening them down to the axles,\r\nattaching a rope to the end of the tongue, and another to the rear of\r\neach to steady it and hold it from drifting below the landing. It is\r\nthen pushed into the stream, and the men on the opposite bank pull it\r\nover. I have passed a large train of wagons in this way across a rapid\r\nstream fifteen feet deep without any difficulty. I took, at the same\r\ntime, a six-pounder cannon, which was separated from its carriage, and\r\nferried over upon the wagon-boat; after which the carriage was pulled\r\nover in the same way as described for the wagons.\r\n\r\nThere are not always a sufficient number of airtight water-casks to\r\nfill a wagon-bed, but a tentfly, paulin, or wagon-cover can generally\r\nbe had. In this event, the wagon-bed may be placed in the centre of one\r\nof these, the cloth brought up around the ends and sides, and secured\r\nfirmly with ropes tied around transversely, and another rope fastened\r\nlengthwise around under the rim. This holds the cloth in its place, and\r\nthe wagon may then be placed in the water right side upward, and\r\nmanaged in the same manner as in the other case. If the cloth be made\r\nof cotton, it will soon swell so as to leak but very little, and\r\nanswers a very good purpose.\r\n\r\nAnother method of ferrying streams is by means of what is called by the\r\nmountaineers a \"_bull-boat_,\" the frame-work of which is made of\r\nwillows bent into the shape of a short and wide skiff, with a flat\r\nbottom. Willows grow upon the banks of almost all the streams on the\r\nprairies, and can be bent into any shape desired. To make a boat with\r\nbut one hide, a number of straight willows are cut about an inch in\r\ndiameter, the ends sharpened and driven into the ground, forming a\r\nframe-work in the shape of a half egg-shell cut through the\r\nlongitudinal axis. Where these rods cross they are firmly secured with\r\nstrings. A stout rod is then heated and bent around the frame in such a\r\nposition that the edges of the hide, when laid over it and drawn tight,\r\nwill just reach it. This rod forms the gunwale, which is secured by\r\nstrings to the ribs. Small rods are then wattled in so as to make it\r\nsymmetrical and strong. After which the green or soaked hide is thrown\r\nover the edges, sewed to the gunwales, and left to dry. The rods are\r\nthen cut off even with the gunwale, and the boat is ready for use.\r\n\r\nTo build a boat with two or more hides: A stout pole of the desired\r\nlength is placed upon the ground for a keel, the ends turned up and\r\nsecured by a lariat; willow rods of the required dimensions are then\r\ncut, heated, and bent into the proper shape for knees, after which\r\ntheir centres are placed at equal distances upon the keel, and firmly\r\ntied with cords. The knees are retained in their proper curvature by\r\ncords around the ends. After a sufficient number of them have been\r\nplaced upon the keel, two poles of suitable dimensions are heated, bent\r\naround the ends for a gunwale, and firmly lashed to each knee. Smaller\r\nwillows are then interwoven, so as to model the frame.\r\n\r\nGreen or soaked hides are cut into the proper shape to fit the frame,\r\nand sewed together with buckskin strings; then the frame of the boat is\r\nplaced in the middle, the hide drawn up snug around the sides, and\r\nsecured with raw-hide thongs to the gunwale. The boat is then turned\r\nbottom upward and left to dry, after which the seams where they have\r\nbeen sewed are covered with a mixture of melted tallow and pitch: the\r\ncraft is now ready for launching.\r\n\r\nA boat of this kind is very light and serviceable, but after a while\r\nbecomes water-soaked, and should always be turned bottom upward to dry\r\nwhenever it is not in the water. Two men can easily build a _bull-boat_\r\nof three hides in two days which will carry ten men with perfect safety.\r\n\r\nA small party traveling with a pack train and arriving upon the banks\r\nof a deep stream will not always have the time to stop or the means to\r\nmake any of the boats that have been described. Should their luggage be\r\nsuch as to become seriously injured by a wetting, and there be an\r\nIndia-rubber or gutta-percha cloth disposable, or if even a green beef\r\nor buffalo hide can be procured, it may be spread out upon the ground,\r\nand the articles of baggage placed in the centre, in a square or\r\nrectangular form; the ends and sides are then brought up so as entirely\r\nto envelop the package, and the whole secured with ropes or raw hide.\r\nIt is then placed in the water with a rope attached to one end, and\r\ntowed across by men in the same manner as the boats before described.\r\nIf hides be used they will require greasing occasionally, to prevent\r\ntheir becoming water-soaked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSSING A STREAM.]\r\n\r\nWhen a mounted party with pack animals arrive upon the borders of a\r\nrapid stream, too deep to ford, and where the banks are high and\r\nabrupt, with perhaps but one place where the beasts can get out upon\r\nthe opposite shore, it would not be safe to drive or ride them in,\r\ncalculating that all will make the desired landing. Some of them will\r\nprobably be carried by the swift current too far down the stream, and\r\nthereby endanger not only their own lives, but the lives of their\r\nriders. I have seen the experiment tried repeatedly, and have known\r\nseveral animals to be carried by the current below the point of egress,\r\nand thus drowned. Here is a simple, safe, and expeditious method of\r\ntaking animals over such a stream. Suppose, for example, a party of\r\nmounted men arrive upon the bank of the stream. There will always be\r\nsome good swimmers in the party, and probably others who can not swim\r\nat all. Three or four of the most expert of these are selected, and\r\nsent across with one end of a rope made of lariats tied together, while\r\nthe other end is retained upon the first bank, and made fast to the\r\nneck of a gentle and good swimming horse; after which another gentle\r\nhorse is brought up and made fast by a lariat around his neck to the\r\ntail of the first, and so on until all the horses are thus tied\r\ntogether. The men who can not swim are then mounted upon the best\r\nswimming horses and tied on, otherwise they are liable to become\r\nfrightened, lose their balance, and be carried away in a rapid current;\r\nor a horse may stumble and throw his rider. After the horses have been\r\nstrung out in a single line by their riders, and every thing is in\r\nreadiness, the first horse is led carefully into the water, while the\r\nmen on the opposite bank, pulling upon the rope, thus direct him\r\nacross, and, if necessary, aid him in stemming the current. As soon as\r\nthis horse strikes bottom he pulls upon those behind him, and thereby\r\nassists them in making the landing, and in this manner all are passed\r\nover in perfect safety.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRIVING LOOSE HORSES.\r\n\r\nIn traveling with loose horses across the plains, some persons are in\r\nthe habit of attaching them in pairs by their halters to a long, stout\r\nrope stretched between two wagons drawn by mules, each wagon being\r\nabout half loaded. The principal object of the rear wagon being to hold\r\nback and keep the rope stretched, not more than two stout mules are\r\nrequired, as the horses aid a good deal with their heads in pulling\r\nthis wagon. From thirty to forty horses may be driven very well in this\r\nmanner, and, if they are wild, it is perhaps the safest method, except\r\nthat of leading them with halters held by men riding beside them. The\r\nrope to which the horses are attached should be about an inch and a\r\nquarter in diameter, with loops or rings inserted at intervals\r\nsufficient to admit the horses without allowing them to kick each\r\nother, and the halter straps tied to these loops. The horses, on first\r\nstarting, should have men by their sides, to accustom them to this\r\nmanner of being led. The wagons should be so driven as to keep the rope\r\ncontinually stretched. Good drivers must be assigned to these wagons,\r\nwho will constantly watch the movements of the horses attached, as well\r\nas their own teams.\r\n\r\nI have had 150 loose horses driven by ten mounted herdsmen. This\r\nrequires great care for some considerable time, until the horses become\r\ngentle and accustomed to their herders. It is important to ascertain,\r\nas soon as possible after starting, which horses are wild, and may be\r\nlikely to stampede and lead off the herd; such should be led, and never\r\nsuffered to run loose, either on the march or in camp. Animals of this\r\ncharacter will soon indicate their propensities, and can be secured\r\nduring the first days of the march. It is desirable that all animals\r\nthat will not stampede when not working should run loose on a march, as\r\nthey pick up a good deal of grass along the road when traveling, and\r\nthe success of an expedition, when animals get no other forage but\r\ngrass, depends in a great degree upon the time given them for grazing.\r\nThey will thrive much better when allowed a free range than when\r\npicketed, as they then are at liberty to select such grass as suits\r\nthem. It may therefore be set down as an infallible rule never to be\r\ndeparted from, that all animals, excepting such as will be likely to\r\nstampede, should be turned loose for grazing immediately after arriving\r\nat the camping-place; but it is equally important that they should be\r\ncarefully herded as near the camp as good grass will admit; and those\r\nthat it is necessary to picket should be placed upon the best grass,\r\nand their places changed often. The ropes to which they are attached\r\nshould be about forty feet long; the picket-pins, of iron, fifteen\r\ninches long, with ring and swivel at top, so that the rope shall not\r\ntwist as the animal feeds around it; and the pins must be firmly driven\r\ninto tenacious earth.\r\n\r\nAnimals should be herded during the day at such distances as to leave\r\nsufficient grass undisturbed around and near the camp for grazing\r\nthrough the night.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF MARCHING.\r\n\r\nAmong men of limited experience in frontier life will be found a great\r\ndiversity of opinion regarding the best methods of marching, and of\r\ntreating animals in expeditions upon the prairies. Some will make late\r\nstarts and travel during the heat of the day without nooning, while\r\nothers will start early and make two marches, laying by during the\r\nmiddle of the day; some will picket their animals continually in camp,\r\nwhile others will herd them day and night, etc., etc. For mounted\r\ntroops, or, indeed, for any body of men traveling with horses and\r\nmules, a few general rules may be specified which have the sanction of\r\nmature experience, and a deviation from them will inevitably result in\r\nconsequences highly detrimental to the best interests of an expedition.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary marches through a country where grass and water are\r\nabundant and good, animals receiving proper attention should not fall\r\naway, even if they receive no grain; and, as I said before, they should\r\nnot be made to travel faster than a walk unless absolutely necessary;\r\nneither should they be taken off the road for the purpose of hunting or\r\nchasing buffalo, as one buffalo-chase injures them more than a week of\r\nmoderate riding. In the vicinity of hostile Indians, the animals must\r\nbe carefully herded and guarded within protection of the camp, while\r\nthose picketed should be changed as often as the grass is eaten off\r\nwithin the circle described by the tether-rope. At night they should be\r\nbrought within the chain of sentinels and picketed as compactly as is\r\nconsistent with the space needed for grazing, and under no\r\ncircumstances, unless the Indians are known to be near and an attack is\r\nto be expected, should they be tied up to a picket line where they can\r\nget no grass. Unless allowed to graze at night they will fall away\r\nrapidly, and soon become unserviceable. It is much better to march\r\nafter nightfall, turn some distance off the road, and to encamp without\r\nfires in a depressed locality where the Indians can not track the\r\nparty, and the animals may be picketed without danger.\r\n\r\nIn descending abrupt hills and mountains one wheel of a loaded wagon\r\nshould always be locked, as this relieves the wheel animals and makes\r\nevery thing more secure. When the declivity is great both rear wheels\r\nshould be locked, and if very abrupt, requiring great effort on the\r\nwheel animals to hold the wagon, the wheels should be rough-locked by\r\nlengthening the lock-chains so that the part which goes around the\r\nwheels will come directly upon the ground, and thus create more\r\nfriction. Occasionally, however, hills are met with so nearly\r\nperpendicular that it becomes necessary to attach ropes to the rear\r\naxle, and to station men to hold back upon them and steady the vehicle\r\ndown the descent. Rough-locking is a very safe method of passing heavy\r\nartillery down abrupt declivities. There are several mountains between\r\nthe Missouri River and California where it is necessary to resort to\r\none of the two last-mentioned methods in order to descend with\r\nsecurity. If there are no lock-chains upon wagons, the front and rear\r\nwheels on the same side may be tied together with ropes so as to lock\r\nthem very firmly.\r\n\r\nIt is an old and well-established custom among men experienced in\r\nfrontier life always to cross a stream upon which it is intended to\r\nencamp for the night, and this rule should never be departed from where\r\na stream is to be forded, as a rise during the night might detain the\r\ntraveler for several days in awaiting the fall of the waters.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORMS.\r\n\r\nIn Western Texas, during the autumn and winter months, storms arise\r\nvery suddenly, and, when accompanied by a north wind, are very severe\r\nupon men and animals; indeed, they are sometimes so terrific as to make\r\nit necessary for travelers to hasten to the nearest sheltered place to\r\nsave the lives of their animals. When these storms come from the north,\r\nthey are called \"_northers;_\" and as, during the winter season, the\r\ntemperature often undergoes a sudden change of many degrees at the time\r\nthe storm sets in, the perspiration is checked, and the system receives\r\nan instantaneous shock, against which it requires great vital energy to\r\nbear up. Men and animals are not, in this mild climate, prepared for\r\nthese capricious meteoric revolutions, and they not unfrequently perish\r\nunder their effects.\r\n\r\nWhile passing near the head waters of the Colorado in October, 1849, I\r\nleft one of my camps at an early hour in the morning under a mild and\r\nsoft atmosphere, with a gentle breeze from the south, but had marched\r\nonly a short distance when the wind suddenly whipped around into the\r\nnorth, bringing with it a furious chilling rain, and in a short time\r\nthe road became so soft and heavy as to make the labor of pulling the\r\nwagons over it very exhausting upon the mules, and they came into camp\r\nin a profuse sweat, with the rain pouring down in torrents upon them.\r\n\r\nThey were turned out of harness into the most sheltered place that\r\ncould be found; but, instead of eating, as was their custom, they\r\nturned their heads from the wind, and remained in that position,\r\nchilled and trembling, without making the least effort to move. The\r\nrain continued with unabated fury during the entire day and night, and\r\non the following morning thirty-five out of one hundred and ten mules\r\nhad perished, while those remaining could hardly be said to have had a\r\nspark of vitality left. They were drawn up with the cold, and could\r\nwith difficulty walk. Tents and wagon-covers were cut up to protect\r\nthem, and they were then driven about for some time, until a little\r\nvital energy was restored, after which they commenced eating grass, but\r\nit was three or four days before they recovered sufficiently to resume\r\nthe march.\r\n\r\nThe mistake I made was in driving the mules after the \"norther\"\r\ncommenced. Had I gone immediately into camp, before they became heated\r\nand wearied, they would probably have eaten the grass, and this, I have\r\nno doubt, would have saved them; but as it was, their blood became\r\nheated from overwork, and the sudden chill brought on a reaction which\r\nproved fatal. If an animal will eat his forage plentifully, there is\r\nbut little danger of his perishing with cold. This I assert with much\r\nconfidence, as I once, when traveling with about 1500 horses and mules,\r\nencountered the most terrific snow-storm that has been known within the\r\nmemory of the oldest mountaineers. It commenced on the last day of\r\nApril, and continued without cessation for sixty consecutive hours. The\r\nday had been mild and pleasant; the green grass was about six inches\r\nhigh; the trees had put out their new leaves, and all nature conspired\r\nto show that the sombre garb of winter had been permanently superseded\r\nby the smiling attire of spring. About dark, however, the wind turned\r\ninto the north; it commenced to snow violently, and increased until it\r\nbecame a frightful tempest, filling the atmosphere with a dense cloud\r\nof driving snow, against which it was impossible to ride or walk. Soon\r\nafter the storm set in, one herd of three hundred horses and mules\r\nbroke away from the herdsmen who were around them, and, in spite of all\r\ntheir efforts, ran at full speed, directly with the wind and snow, for\r\nfifty miles before they stopped.\r\n\r\nThree of the herdsmen followed them as far as they were able, but soon\r\nbecame exhausted and lost on the prairie. One of them found his way\r\nback to camp in a state of great prostration and suffering. One of the\r\nothers was found dead, and the third crawling about upon his hands and\r\nknees, after the storm ceased.\r\n\r\nIt happened, fortunately, that I had reserved a quantity of corn to be\r\nused in the event of finding a scarcity of grass, and as soon as the\r\nground became covered with snow, so that the animals could not get at\r\nthe grass, I fed out the corn, which I am induced to believe saved\r\ntheir lives. Indeed, they did not seem to be at all affected by this\r\nprolonged and unseasonable tempest. This occurred upon the summit of\r\nthe elevated ridge dividing the waters of the Arkansas and South Platte\r\nRivers, where storms are said to be of frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the animals that stampeded were recovered after the\r\nstorm, and, although they had traveled a hundred miles at a very rapid\r\npace, they did not seem to be much affected by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPacking.

Cures for the Bite.\r\n\r\n\r\nPACKING AND DRIVING.\r\n\r\nWith a train of pack animals properly organized and equipped, a party\r\nmay travel with much comfort and celerity. It is enabled to take short\r\ncuts, and move over the country in almost any direction without regard\r\nto roads. Mountains and broken ground may easily be traversed, and\r\nexemption is gained from many of the troubles and detentions attendant\r\nupon the transit of cumbersome wagon-trains.\r\n\r\nOne of the most essential requisites to the outfit of a pack train is a\r\ngood pack-saddle. Various patterns are in use, many of which are mere\r\ninstruments of torture upon the backs of the poor brutes, lacerating\r\nthem cruelly, and causing continued pain.\r\n\r\nThe Mexicans use a leathern pack-saddle without a tree. It is stuffed\r\nwith hay, and is very large, covering almost the entire back, and\r\nextending far down the sides. It is secured with a broad hair girth,\r\nand the load is kept in position by a lash-rope drawn by two men so\r\ntight as to give the unfortunate beast intense suffering.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRIMSLEY'S PACK-SADDLE.]\r\n\r\nA pack-saddle is made by T. Grimsley, No. 41 Main Street, St. Louis,\r\nMo. It is open at the top, with a light, compact, and strong tree,\r\nwhich fits the animal's back well, and is covered with raw hide, put on\r\ngreen, and drawn tight by the contraction in drying. It has a leathern\r\nbreast-strap, breeching, and lash-strap, with a broad hair girth\r\nfastened in the Mexican fashion. Of sixty-five of these saddles that I\r\nused in crossing the Rocky Mountains, over an exceedingly rough and\r\nbroken section, not one of them wounded a mule's back, and I regard\r\nthem as the best saddles I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nNo people, probably, are more familiar with the art of packing than the\r\nMexicans. They understand the habits, disposition, and powers of the\r\nmule perfectly, and will get more work out of him than any other men I\r\nhave ever seen. The mule and the donkey are to them as the camel to the\r\nArab--their porters over deserts and mountains where no other means of\r\ntransportation can be used to advantage. The Spanish Mexicans are,\r\nhowever, cruel masters, having no mercy upon their beasts, and it is no\r\nuncommon thing for them to load their mules with the enormous burden of\r\nthree or four hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nThese muleteers believe that, when the pack is firmly lashed, the\r\nanimal supports his burden better and travels with greater ease, which\r\nseems quite probable, as the tension forms, as it were, an external\r\nsheath supporting and bracing the muscles. It also has a tendency to\r\nprevent the saddle from slipping and chafing the mule's back. With such\r\nhuge _cargas_ as the Mexicans load upon their mules, it is impossible,\r\nby any precautions, to prevent their backs and withers from becoming\r\nhorribly mangled, and it is common to see them working their animals\r\nday after day in this miserable plight. This heavy packing causes the\r\nscars that so often mark Mexican mules.\r\n\r\nThe animal, in starting out from camp in the morning, groaning under\r\nthe weight of his heavy burden, seems hardly able to move; but the pack\r\nsoon settles, and so loosens the lashing that after a short time he\r\nmoves along with more ease. Constant care and vigilance on the part of\r\nthe muleteers are necessary to prevent the packs from working loose and\r\nfalling off. The adjustment of a _carga_ upon a mule does not, however,\r\ndetain the caravan, as the others move on while it is being righted. If\r\nthe mules are suffered to halt, they are apt to lie down, and it is\r\nvery difficult for them, with their loads, to rise; besides, they are\r\nlikely to strain themselves in their efforts to do so. The Mexicans, in\r\ntraveling with large caravans, usually make the day's march without\r\nnooning, as too much time would be consumed in unloading and packing up\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nPacks, when taken off in camp, should be piled in a row upon the\r\nground, and, if there be a prospect of rain, the saddles should be\r\nplaced over them, and the whole covered with the saddle-blankets or\r\ncanvas.\r\n\r\nThe muleteers and herders should be mounted upon well-trained horses,\r\nand be careful to keep the animals of the caravan from wandering or\r\nscattering along the road. This can easily be done by having some of\r\nthe men riding upon each side, and others in rear of the caravan.\r\n\r\nIn herding mules it is customary among prairie travelers to have a\r\nbell-mare, to which the mules soon become so attached that they will\r\nfollow her wherever she goes. By keeping her in charge of one of the\r\nherdsmen, the herds are easily controlled; and during a stampede, if\r\nthe herdsman mounts her, and rushes ahead toward camp, they will\r\ngenerally follow.\r\n\r\nIn crossing rivers the bell-mare should pass first, after which the\r\nmules are easily induced to take to the water and pass over, even if\r\nthey have to swim. Mules are good swimmers unless they happen, by\r\nplunging off a high bank, to get water in their ears, when they are\r\noften drowned. Whenever a mule in the water drops his ears, it is a\r\nsure indication that he has water in them, and he should be taken out\r\nas soon as possible. To prevent accidents of this nature, where the\r\nwater is deep and the banks abrupt, the mule herds should be allowed to\r\nenter slowly, and without crowding, as otherwise they are not only\r\nlikely to get their heads under water, but to throw each other over and\r\nget injured.\r\n\r\nThe _madrina_, or bell-mare, acts a most important part in a herd\r\nof mules, and is regarded by experienced campaigners as indispensable\r\nto their security. She is selected for her quiet and regular habits.\r\nShe will not wander far from the camp. If she happen to have a colt by\r\nher side, this is no objection, as the mules soon form the most devoted\r\nattachment to it. I have often seen them leave their grazing when very\r\nhungry, and flock around a small colt, manifesting their delight by\r\nrubbing it with their noses, licking it with their tongues, kicking up\r\ntheir heels, and making a variety of other grotesque demonstrations of\r\naffection, while the poor little colt, perfectly unconscious of the\r\ncause of these ungainly caresses, stood trembling with fear, but unable\r\nto make his escape from the compact circle of his mulish admirers.\r\nHorses and asses are also used as bell animals, and the mules soon\r\nbecome accustomed to following them. If a man leads or rides a bell\r\nanimal in advance, the mules follow, like so many dogs, in the most\r\norderly procession.\r\n\r\n\"After traveling about fourteen miles,\" says Bayard Taylor, \"we were\r\njoined by three miners, and our mules, taking a sudden liking for their\r\nhorses, jogged on at a more brisk pace. The instincts of the mulish\r\nheart form an interesting study to the traveler in the mountains. I\r\nwould (were the comparison not too ungallant) liken it to a woman's,\r\nfor it is quite as uncertain in its sympathies, bestowing its\r\naffections when least expected, and, when bestowed, quite as constant,\r\nso long as the object is not taken away. Sometimes a horse, sometimes\r\nan ass, captivates the fancy of a whole drove of mules, but often an\r\nanimal nowise akin. Lieutenant Beale told me that his whole train of\r\nmules once galloped off suddenly, on the plains of the Cimarone, and\r\nran half a mile, when they halted in apparent satisfaction. The cause\r\nof their freak was found to be a buffalo calf which had strayed from\r\nthe herd. They were frisking around it in the greatest delight, rubbing\r\ntheir noses against it, throwing up their heels, and making themselves\r\nridiculous by abortive attempts to neigh and bray, while the calf,\r\nunconscious of its attractive qualities, stood trembling in their\r\nmidst.\"\r\n\r\n\"If several large troops,\" says Charles Darwin, \"are turned into one\r\nfield to graze in the morning, the muleteer has only to lead the\r\n_madrinas_ a little apart and tinkle their bells, and, although there\r\nmay be 200 or 300 mules together, each immediately knows its own bell,\r\nand separates itself from the rest. The affection of these animals for\r\ntheir madrina saves infinite trouble. It is nearly impossible to lose\r\nan old mule, for, if detained several hours by force, she will, by the\r\npower of smell, like a dog, track out her companions, or rather the\r\nmadrina; for, according to the muleteer, she is the chief object of\r\naffection. The feeling, however, is not of an individual nature, for I\r\nbelieve I am right in saying that any animal with a bell will serve as\r\na madrina.\"\r\n\r\nOf the attachment that a mule will form for a horse, I will cite an\r\ninstance from my own observation, which struck me at the time as being\r\none of the most remarkable and touching evidences of devotion that I\r\nhave ever known among the brute creation.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Fort Leavenworth with the army for Utah in 1857, one of the\r\nofficers rode a small mule, whose kind and gentle disposition soon\r\ncaused him to become a favorite among the soldiers, and they named him\r\n\"Billy.\" As this officer and myself were often thrown together upon the\r\nmarch, the mule, in the course of a few days, evinced a growing\r\nattachment for a mare that I rode. The sentiment was not, however,\r\nreciprocated on her part, and she intimated as much by the reversed\r\nposition of her ears, and the free exercise of her feet and teeth\r\nwhenever Billy came within her reach; but these signal marks of\r\ndispleasure, instead of discouraging, rather seemed to increase his\r\ndevotion, and whenever at liberty he invariably sought to get near her,\r\nand appeared much distressed when not permitted to follow her.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Camp Scott for New Mexico Billy was among the number of\r\nmules selected for the expedition. During the march I was in the habit,\r\nwhen starting out from camp in the morning, of leading off the party,\r\nand directing the packmen to hold the mule until I should get so far in\r\nadvance with the mare that he could not see us; but the moment he was\r\nreleased he would, in spite of all the efforts of the packers, start\r\noff at a most furious pace, and never stop or cease braying until he\r\nreached the mare's side. We soon found it impossible to keep him with\r\nthe other mules, and he was finally permitted to have his own way.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time we encountered the deep snows in the Rocky\r\nMountains, where the animals could get no forage, and Billy, in common\r\nwith the others, at length became so weak and jaded that he was unable\r\nany longer to leave his place in the caravan and break a track through\r\nthe snow around to the front. He made frequent attempts to turn out and\r\nforce his way ahead, but after numerous unsuccessful efforts he would\r\nfall down exhausted, and set up a most mournful braying.\r\n\r\nThe other mules soon began to fail, and to be left, worn out and\r\nfamished, to die by the wayside; it was not, however, for some time\r\nthat Billy showed symptoms of becoming one of the victims, until one\r\nevening after our arrival at camp I was informed that he had dropped\r\ndown and been left upon the road during the day. The men all deplored\r\nhis loss exceedingly, as his devotion to the mare had touched their\r\nkind hearts, and many expressions of sympathy were uttered around their\r\nbivouac fires on that evening.\r\n\r\nMuch to our surprise, however, about ten o'clock, just as we were about\r\ngoing to sleep, we heard a mule braying about half a mile to the rear\r\nupon our trail. Sure enough, it proved to be Billy, who, after having\r\nrested, had followed upon our track and overtaken us. As soon as he\r\nreached the side of the mare he lay down and seemed perfectly\r\ncontented.\r\n\r\nThe next day I relieved him from his pack, and allowed him to run\r\nloose; but during the march he gave out, and was again abandoned to his\r\nfate, and this time we certainly never expected to see him more. To our\r\ngreat astonishment, however, about twelve o'clock that night the\r\nsonorous but not very musical notes of Billy in the distance aroused us\r\nfrom our slumbers, and again announced his approach. In an instant the\r\nmen were upon their feet, gave three hearty cheers, and rushed out in a\r\nbody to meet and escort him into camp.\r\n\r\nBut this well-meant ovation elicited no response from him. He came\r\nreeling and floundering along through the deep snow, perfectly\r\nregardless of these honors, pushing aside all those who occupied the\r\ntrail or interrupted his progress in the least, wandered about until he\r\nfound the mare, dropped down by her side, and remained until morning.\r\n\r\nWhen we resumed our march on the following day he made another\r\ndesperate effort to proceed, but soon fell down exhausted, when we\r\nreluctantly abandoned him, and saw him no more.\r\n\r\nAlas! poor Billy! your constancy deserved a better fate; you may,\r\nindeed, be said to have been a victim to unrequited affection.\r\n\r\nThe articles to be transported should be made up into two packages of\r\nprecisely equal weight, and as nearly equal in bulk as practicable,\r\notherwise they will sway the saddle over to one side, and cause it to\r\nchafe the animal's back.\r\n\r\nThe packages made, two ropes about six feet long are fastened around\r\nthe ends by a slip-knot, and if the packages contain corn or other\r\narticles that will shift about, small sticks should be placed between\r\nthe sacks and the ropes, which equalizes the pressure and keeps the\r\npackages snug. The ropes are then looped at the ends, and made\r\nprecisely of the same length, so that the packs will balance and come\r\nup well toward the top of the saddle. Two men then, each taking a pack,\r\ngo upon opposite sides of the mule, that has been previously saddled,\r\nand, raising the packs simultaneously, place the loops over the pommel\r\nand cantel, settling them well down into their places. The\r\nlashing-strap is then thrown over the top, brought through the rings\r\nupon each side, and drawn as tight at every turn as the two men on the\r\nsides can pull it, and, after having been carried back and forth\r\ndiagonally across the packs as often as its length admits (generally\r\nthree or four times), it is made fast to one of the rings, and securely\r\ntied in a slip-knot.\r\n\r\nThe breast-strap and breeching must not be buckled so close as to chafe\r\nthe skin; the girth should be broad and soft where it comes opposite\r\nthe fore legs, to prevent cutting them. Leather girths should be\r\nwrapped with cloth or bound with soft material. The hair girth, being\r\nsoft and elastic, is much better than leather.\r\n\r\nThe crupper should never be dispensed with in a mountainous country,\r\nbut it must be soft, round, and about an inch in diameter where it\r\ncomes in contact with the tail, otherwise it will wound the animal in\r\nmaking long and abrupt descents.\r\n\r\nIn Norway they use a short round stick, about ten inches long, which\r\npasses under the tail, and from each end of this a cord connects with\r\nthe saddle.\r\n\r\nCamp-kettles, tin vessels, and other articles that will rattle and be\r\nlikely to frighten animals, should be firmly lashed to the packs. When\r\nthe packs work loose, the lash-strap should be untied, and a man upon\r\neach side draw it up again and make it fast. When ropes are used for\r\nlashing, they may be tightened by twisting them with a short stick and\r\nmaking the stick fast.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and twenty-five pounds is a sufficient load for a mule upon\r\na long journey.\r\n\r\nIn traveling over a rocky country, and upon all long journeys, horses\r\nand mules should be shod, to prevent their hoofs wearing out or\r\nbreaking. The mountaineers contend that beasts travel better without\r\nshoeing, but I have several times had occasion to regret the omission\r\nof this very necessary precaution. A few extra shoes and nails, with a\r\nsmall hammer, will enable travelers to keep their animals shod.\r\n\r\nIn turning out pack animals to graze, it is well either to keep the\r\nlariat ropes upon them with the ends trailing upon the ground, or to\r\nhopple them, as no corral can be made into which they may be driven in\r\norder to catch them. A very good way to catch an animal without driving\r\nhim into an inclosure is for two men to take a long rope and stretch it\r\nout at the height of the animal's neck; some men then drive him slowly\r\nup against it, when one of the men with the rope runs around behind the\r\nanimal and back to the front again, thus taking a turn with the rope\r\naround his neck and holding him secure.\r\n\r\nTo prevent an animal from kicking, take a forked stick and make the\r\nforked part fast to the bridle-bit, bringing the two ends above the\r\nhead and securing them there, leaving the part of the stick below the\r\nfork of sufficient length to reach near the ground when the animal's\r\nhead is in its natural position. He can not kick up unless he lowers\r\nhis head, and the stick effectually prevents that.\r\n\r\nTether-ropes should be so attached to the neck of the animal as not to\r\nslip and choke him, and the picket-pins never be left on the ropes\r\nexcept when in the ground, as, in the event of a stampede, they are\r\nvery likely to swing around and injure the animals.\r\n\r\nMany experienced travelers were formerly in the habit of securing their\r\nanimals with a strap or iron ring fastened around the fetlock of one\r\nfore foot, and this attached to the tether-rope. This method holds the\r\nanimal very securely to the picket-pin, but when the rope is first put\r\non, and before he becomes accustomed to it, he is liable to throw\r\nhimself down and get hurt; so that I think the plan of tethering by the\r\nneck or halter is the safest, and, so far as I have observed, is now\r\nuniversally practiced.\r\n\r\nThe mountaineers and Indians seldom tether their animals, but prefer\r\nthe plan of hoppling, as this gives them more latitude for ranging and\r\nselecting the choicest grass.\r\n\r\nTwo methods of hoppling are practiced among the Indians and hunters of\r\nthe West: one with a strap about two feet long buckling around the fore\r\nlegs above the fetlock joints; the other is what they term the \"_side\r\nhopple_\" which is made by buckling a strap around a front and rear\r\nleg upon the same side. In both cases care should be taken not to\r\nbuckle the strap so tight as to chafe the legs. The latter plan is the\r\nbest, because the animal, side-hoppled, is able to go but little faster\r\nthan a walk, while the front hopple permits him, after a little\r\npractice, to gallop off at considerable speed. If the hopples are made\r\nof iron connected with chains, like handcuffs, with locks and keys, it\r\nwill be impossible for the Indians, without files, to cut them; but the\r\nparts that come in contact with the legs should be covered with soft\r\nleather.\r\n\r\n\"A horse,\" says Mr. Galton, \"may be hoppled with a stirrup-leather by\r\nplacing the middle around one leg, then twisting it several times and\r\nbuckling it round the other leg. When you wish to picket horses in the\r\nmiddle of a sandy plain, dig a hole two or three feet deep, and, tying\r\nyour rope to a fagot of sticks or brushwood, or even to a bag filled\r\nwith sand, bury this in it.\"\r\n\r\nFor prairie service, horses which have been raised exclusively upon\r\ngrass, and never been fed on grain, or \"_range horses_,\" as they are\r\ncalled in the West, are decidedly the best, and will perform more hard\r\nlabor than those that have been stabled and groomed. The large, stout\r\nponies found among some of our frontier settlements are well adapted to\r\nthis service, and endure admirably. The same remarks hold good in the\r\nchoice of mules; and it will be found that the square-built, big-bellied,\r\nand short-legged Mexican mule will endure far more hard service, on\r\nshort allowance of forage, than the larger American mule which has been\r\naccustomed to grain.\r\n\r\nIn our trip across the Rocky Mountains we had both the American and\r\nMexican mules, and improved a good opportunity of giving their relative\r\npowers of endurance a thorough service-trial. For many days they were\r\nreduced to a meagre allowance of dry grass, and at length got nothing\r\nbut pine leaves, while their work in the deep snow was exceedingly\r\nsevere. This soon told upon the American mules, and all of them, with\r\nthe exception of two, died, while most of the Mexican mules went\r\nthrough. The result was perfectly conclusive.\r\n\r\nWe found that, where the snow was not more than two feet deep, the\r\nanimals soon learned to paw it away and get at the grass. Of course\r\nthey do not get sufficient in this way, but they do much better than\r\none would suppose.\r\n\r\nIn Utah and New Mexico the autumn is so dry that the grass does not\r\nlose its nutritious properties by being washed with rains. It gradually\r\ndries and cures like hay, so that animals eat it freely, and will\r\nfatten upon it even in mid-winter. It is seldom that any grain is fed\r\nto stock in either of these territories.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the varieties of grass growing upon the slopes of the Rocky\r\nMountains are of excellent quality; among these may be mentioned the\r\nGramma and bunch grasses. Horses and mules turned out to graze always\r\nprefer the grass upon the mountain sides to grass of the valleys.\r\n\r\nWe left New Mexico about the first of March, six weeks before the new\r\ngrass appeared, with 1500 animals, many of them low in flesh, yet they\r\nimproved upon the journey, and on their arrival in Utah were all, with\r\nvery few exceptions, in fine working condition. Had this march been\r\nmade at the same season in the country bordering upon the Missouri\r\nRiver, where there are heavy autumnal rains, the animals would probably\r\nhave become very poor.\r\n\r\nIn this journey the herds were allowed to range over the best grass\r\nthat could be found, but were guarded both night and day with great\r\ncare, whereas, if they had been corraled or picketed at night, I dare\r\nsay they would have lost flesh.[3]\r\n\r\n      [3] Some curious and interesting experiments are said to have\r\n      been recently made at the veterinary school at Alfort, near\r\n      Paris, by order of the minister of war, to ascertain the powers\r\n      of endurance of horses. It appears that a horse will live on\r\n      water alone five-and-twenty days; seventeen days without eating\r\n      or drinking; only five days if fed and unwatered; ten days if fed\r\n      and insufficiently watered. A horse kept without water for three\r\n      days drank one hundred and four pounds of water in three minutes.\r\n      It was found that a horse taken immediately after \"feed,\" and\r\n      kept in the active exercise of the \"squadron school,\" completely\r\n      digested its \"feed\" in three hours; in the same time in the\r\n      \"conscript's school\" its food was two thirds digested; and if\r\n      kept perfectly quiet in the stable, its digestion was scarcely\r\n      commenced in three hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nSADDLES.\r\n\r\nGreat diversity of opinion exists regarding the best equipment for\r\nhorses, and the long-mooted question is as yet very far from being\r\ndefinitely settled.\r\n\r\nI do not regard the opinions of Europeans as having a more direct\r\nbearing upon this question, or as tending to establish any more\r\ndefinite and positive conclusions regarding it than have been developed\r\nby the experience of our own border citizens, the major part of whose\r\nlives has been spent in the saddle; yet I am confident that the\r\nfollowing brief description of the horse equipments used in different\r\nparts of Europe, the substance of which I have extracted from Captain\r\nM'Clellan's interesting report, will be read with interest and\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nThe saddle used by the African chasseurs consists of a plain wooden\r\ntree, with a pad upon the top, but without skirts, and is somewhat\r\nsimilar to our own military saddle, but lower in the pommel and cantle.\r\nThe girth and surcingle are of leather, with an ordinary woolen\r\nsaddle-blanket. Their bridle has a single head-stall, with the Spanish\r\nbit buckled to it.\r\n\r\nA new saddle has recently been introduced into the French service by\r\nCaptain Cogent, the tree of which is cut out of a single piece of wood,\r\nthe cantle only being glued on, and a piece of walnut let into the\r\npommel, with a thin strip veneered upon the front ends of the bars. The\r\npommel and cantle are lower than in the old model; the whole is covered\r\nwith wet raw hide, glued on and sewed at the edges. The great advantage\r\nthis saddle possesses is in being so arranged that it may be used for\r\nhorses of all sizes and conditions. The saddle-blanket is made of thick\r\nfelt cloth, and is attached to the pommel by a small strap passing\r\nthrough holes in the blanket, which is thus prevented from slipping,\r\nand at the same time it raises the saddle so as to admit a free\r\ncirculation of air over the horse's spine.\r\n\r\nThe Hungarian saddle is made of hard wood entirely uncovered, with a\r\nraised pommel and cantle. The seat is formed with a leather strap four\r\ninches wide nailed to the forks on the front and rear, and secured to\r\nthe side-boards by leather thongs, thus giving an elastic and easy\r\nsaddle-seat. This is also the form of the saddle-tree used by the\r\nRussian and Austrian cavalry. The Russians have a leather girth\r\nfastened by three small buckles: it passes over the tree, and is tied\r\nto the side-boards. The saddle-blanket is of stout felt cloth in four\r\nthicknesses, and a layer of black leather over it, and the whole held\r\ntogether by leather thongs passing through and through. When the horse\r\nfalls off in flesh, more thicknesses are added, and \"_vice versa_.\"\r\nThis saddle-blanket is regarded by the Russian officers as the best\r\npossible arrangement. The Russians use the curb and snaffle-bits made\r\nof steel.\r\n\r\nThe Cossack saddle has a thick padding under the side-boards and on the\r\nseat, which raises the rider very high on his horse, so that his feet\r\nare above the bottom of the belly. Their bridle has but a simple\r\nsnaffle-bit, and no martingale.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian cuirassiers have a heavy saddle with a low pommel and\r\ncantle, covered with leather, but it is not thought by Captain\r\nM'Clellan to present any thing worthy of imitation.\r\n\r\nThe other Prussian cavalry ride the Hungarian saddle, of a heavier\r\nmodel than the one in the Austrian service. The surcingle is of\r\nleather, and fastens in the Mexican style; the girth is also of\r\nleather, three and a half inches wide, with a large buckle. It is in\r\ntwo parts, attached to the bars by raw-hide thongs. The curb and\r\nsnaffle steel bits are used, and attached to a single head-stall.\r\n\r\nThe English cavalry use a saddle which has a lower cantle and pommel\r\nthan our _Grimsley_ saddle, covered with leather. The snaffle-bit\r\nis attached to the halter head-stall by a chain and T; the curb has a\r\nseparate head-stall, which on a march is occasionally taken off and\r\nhung on the carbine stock.\r\n\r\nThe Sardinian saddle has a bare wooden tree very similar to the\r\nHungarian. A common blanket, folded in twelve thicknesses, is placed\r\nunder it. The girth and surcingle are of leather.\r\n\r\nWithout expressing any opinion as to the comparative merits of these\r\ndifferent saddles, I may be permitted to give a few general principles,\r\nwhich I regard as infallible in the choice of a saddle.\r\n\r\nThe side-boards should be large, and made to conform to the shape of\r\nthe horse's back, thereby distributing the burden over a large surface.\r\nIt should stand up well above the spine, so as to admit a free\r\ncirculation of air under it.\r\n\r\nFor long journeys, the crupper, where it comes in contact with the\r\ntail, should be made of soft leather. It should be drawn back only far\r\nenough to hold the saddle from the withers. Some horses require much\r\nmore tension upon the crupper than others. The girth should be made\r\nbroad, of a soft and elastic material. Those made of hair, in use among\r\nthe Mexicans, fulfill the precited conditions.\r\n\r\nA light and easy bit, which will not fret or chafe the horse, is\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nThe saddle-blanket must be folded even and smooth, and placed on so as\r\nto cover every part of the back that comes in contact with the saddle,\r\nand in warm weather it is well to place a gunny bag under the blanket,\r\nas it is cooler than the wool.\r\n\r\nIt will have been observed that, in the French service, the folded\r\nsaddle-blanket is tied to the pommel to prevent it slipping back. This\r\nis well if the blanket be taken off and thoroughly dried whenever the\r\nhorse is unsaddled.\r\n\r\nA saddle-blanket made of moss is used in some of the Southwestern\r\nStates, which is regarded by many as the perfection of this article of\r\nhorse equipment. It is a mat woven into the proper shape and size from\r\nthe beaten fibres of moss that hangs from the trees in our Southern\r\nStates. It is cheap, durable, is not in any way affected by sweat, and\r\ndoes not chafe or heat the horse's spine like the woolen blanket. Its\r\nopen texture allows a rapid evaporation, which tends to keep the back\r\ncool, and obviates the danger of stripping and sudden exposure of the\r\nheated parts to the sun and air.\r\n\r\nThe experience of some of our officers who have used this mat for years\r\nin Mexico and Texas corroborates all I have said in its favor; and they\r\nare unanimous in the opinion that a horse will never get a sore back\r\nwhen it is placed under a good saddle.\r\n\r\nA saddle made by the Mexicans in California is called the _California\r\nsaddle_. This is extensively used upon the Pacific slope of the\r\nmountains, and is believed to possess, at least, as many advantages for\r\nrough frontier service as any other pattern that has been invented.\r\nThose hardy and experienced veterans, the mountaineers, could not be\r\npersuaded to ride any other saddle, and their ripened knowledge of such\r\nmatters certainly gives weight to their conclusions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALIFORNIA SADDLE.]\r\n\r\nThe merits of the California saddle consist in its being light, strong,\r\nand compact, and conforming well to the shape of the horse. When\r\nstrapped on, it rests so firmly in position that the strongest pull of\r\na horse upon a lariat attached to the pommel can not displace it. Its\r\nshape is such that the rider is compelled to sit nearly erect, with his\r\nlegs on the continuation of the line of the body, which makes his seat\r\nmore secure, and, at the same time, gives him a better control over his\r\narms and horse. This position is attained by setting the stirrup-leathers\r\nfarther back than on the old-fashioned saddle. The pommel is high, like\r\nthe Mexican saddle, and prevents the rider from being thrown forward.\r\nThe tree is covered with raw hide, put on green, and sewed; when this\r\ndries and contracts it gives it great strength. It has no iron in its\r\ncomposition, but is kept together by buckskin strings, and can easily\r\nbe taken to pieces for mending or cleaning. It has a hair girth about\r\nfive inches wide.\r\n\r\nThe whole saddle is covered with a large and thick sheet of\r\nsole-leather, having a hole to lay over the pommel; it extends back\r\nover the horse's hips, and protects them from rain, and when taken off\r\nin camp it furnishes a good security against dampness when placed under\r\nthe traveler's bed.\r\n\r\nThe California saddle-tree is regarded by many as the best of all\r\nothers for the horse's back, and as having an easier seat than the\r\nMexican.\r\n\r\nGeneral Comte de la Roche-Aymon, in his treatise upon \"Light Troops,\"\r\npublished in Paris in 1856, says:\r\n\r\n\"In nearly all the European armies the equipment of the horse is not in\r\nharmony with the new tactics--with those tactics in which, during\r\nnearly all of a campaign, the cavalry remains in bivouac. Have we\r\nreflected upon the kind of saddle which, under these circumstances,\r\nwould cover the horse best without incommoding him during the short\r\nperiods that he is permitted to repose? Have we reflected upon the kind\r\nof saddle which, offering the least fragility, exposes the horse to the\r\nleast danger of sore back? All the cuirassiers and the dragoons of\r\nEurope have saddles which they call _French saddle_, the weight of\r\nwhich is a load for the horse. The interior mechanism of these saddles\r\nis complicated and filled with weak bands of iron, which become\r\nderanged, bend, and sometimes break; the rider does not perceive these\r\naccidents, or he does not wish to perceive them, for fear of being left\r\nbehind or of having to go on foot; he continues on, and at the end of a\r\nday's march his horse has a sore back, and in a few days is absolutely\r\nunserviceable. We may satisfy ourselves of the truth of these\r\nobservations by comparing the lists of horses sent to the rear during\r\nthe course of a campaign by the cuirassiers and dragoons who use the\r\nFrench saddle, and by the hussars with the Hungarian saddle. The number\r\nsent to the rear by the latter is infinitely less, although employed in\r\na service much more active and severe; and it might be still less by\r\nmaking some slight improvements in the manner of fixing their saddle\r\nupon the horse.\r\n\r\n\"It is a long time since Marshal Saxe said there was but one kind of\r\nsaddle fit for cavalry, which was the hussar saddle: this combined all\r\nadvantages, lightness, solidity, and economy. It is astonishing that\r\nthe system of actual war had not led to the employment of the kind of\r\nsaddle in use among the Tartars, the Cossacks, the Hungarians, and,\r\nindeed, among all horsemen and nomads. This saddle has the\r\nincontestable advantage of permitting the horse to lie down and rest\r\nhimself without inconvenience. If, notwithstanding the folded blanket\r\nwhich they place under the Hungarian saddle, this saddle will still\r\nwound the animal's back sometimes, this only proceeds from the friction\r\noccasioned by the motion of the horse and the movement of the rider\r\nupon the saddle; a friction which it will be nearly impossible to\r\navoid, inasmuch as the saddle-bow is held in its place only by a\r\nsurcingle, the ends of which are united by a leathern band: these bands\r\nalways relax more or less, and the saddle becomes loose. To remedy\r\nthis, I propose to attach to the saddle-bow itself a double girth, one\r\nend of which shall be made fast to the arch in front, and the other end\r\nto the rear of the arch upon the right side, to unite in a single\r\ngirth, which would buckle to a strap attached upon the left side in the\r\nusual manner. This buckle will hold the saddle firmly in its place.\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding all these precautions, however, there were still some\r\ninconveniences resulting from the nature of the blanket placed under\r\nthe saddle, which I sought to remedy, and I easily accomplished it. The\r\nwoolen nap of the cavalry saddle-blankets, not being carefully attended\r\nto, soon wears off, and leaves only the rough, coarse threads of the\r\nfabric; this absorbs the sweat from the horse, and, after it has dried\r\nand become hard, it acts like a rasp upon the withers, first taking off\r\nthe hair, next the skin, and then the flesh, and, finally, the beast is\r\nrendered unserviceable.\r\n\r\n\"I sought, during the campaign of 1807, a means to remedy this evil,\r\nand I soon succeeded by a process as simple as it was cheap. I\r\ndistributed among a great number of cavalry soldiers pieces of linen\r\ncloth folded double, two feet square, and previously dipped in melted\r\ntallow. This cloth was laid next to the horse's back, under the\r\nsaddle-blanket, and it prevented all the bad effects of the woolen\r\nblanket. No horses, after this appliance, were afflicted with sore\r\nbacks. Such are the slight changes which I believe should be made in\r\nthe use of the Hungarian saddle. The remainder of the equipment should\r\nremain (as it always has been) composed of a breast-strap, crupper, and\r\nmartingale, etc.\"\r\n\r\nThe improvements of the present age do not appear to have developed any\r\nthing advantageous to the saddle; on the contrary, after experimenting\r\nupon numerous modifications and inventions, public sentiment has at\r\nlength given the preference to the saddle-tree of the natives in Asia\r\nand America, which is very similar to that of the Hungarians.\r\n\r\n\r\nSORES AND DISEASES.\r\n\r\nIf a horse be sweating at the time he is unsaddled, it is well to strap\r\nthe folded saddle-blanket upon his back with the surcingle, where it is\r\nallowed to remain until he is perfectly dry. This causes the back to\r\ncool gradually, and prevents scalding or swelling. Some persons are in\r\nthe habit of washing their horses' backs while heated and sweating with\r\ncold water, but this is pernicious, and often produces sores. It is\r\nwell enough to wash the back after it cools, but not before. After\r\nhorses' backs or shoulders once become chafed and sore, it is very\r\ndifficult to heal them, particularly when they are continued at work.\r\nIt is better, if practicable, to stop using them for a while, and wash\r\nthe bruised parts often with castile soap and water. Should it be\r\nnecessary, however, to continue the animal in use, I have known very\r\nsevere sores entirely healed by the free application of grease to the\r\nparts immediately after halting, and while the animal is warm and\r\nsweating. This seems to harden the skin and heal the wound even when\r\nworking with the collar in contact with it. A piece of bacon rind tied\r\nupon the collar over the wound is also an excellent remedy.\r\n\r\nIn Texas, when the horse-flies are numerous, they attack animals\r\nwithout mercy, and where a contusion is found in the skin they deposit\r\neggs, which speedily produce worms in great numbers. I have tried the\r\neffect of spirits of turpentine and several other remedies, but nothing\r\nseemed to have the desired effect but calomel blown into the wound,\r\nwhich destroyed the worms and soon effected a cure.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of the South Pass, upon the Humboldt River, and in some\r\nsections upon other routes to California, alkaline water is found,\r\nwhich is very poisonous to animals that drink it, and generates a\r\ndisease known in California as \"_alkali_.\" This disease first makes its\r\nappearance by swellings upon the abdomen and between the fore legs, and\r\nis attended with a cough, which ultimately destroys the lungs and kills\r\nthe animal. If taken at an early stage, this disease is curable, and\r\nthe following treatment is generally considered as the most\r\nefficacious. The animal is first raked, after which a large dose of\r\ngrease is poured down its throat; acids are said to have the same\r\neffect, and give immediate relief. When neither of these remedies can\r\nbe procured, many of the emigrants have been in the habit of mixing\r\nstarch or flour in a bucket of water, and allowing the animal to drink\r\nit. It is supposed that this forms a coating over the mucous membrane,\r\nand thus defeats the action of the poison.\r\n\r\nAnimals should never be allowed to graze in the vicinity of alkaline\r\nwater, as the deposits upon the grass after floods are equally\r\ndeleterious with the water itself.\r\n\r\nIn seasons when the water is low in the Humboldt River, there is much\r\nless danger of the alkali, as the running water in the river then comes\r\nfrom pure mountain springs, and is confined to the channel; whereas,\r\nduring high water, when the banks are overflowed, the salts are\r\ndissolved, making the water more impure.\r\n\r\nFor _colic_, a good remedy is a mixture of two table-spoonfuls of\r\nbrandy and two tea-spoonfuls of laudanum dissolved in a bottle of water\r\nand poured down the animal's throat. Another remedy, which has been\r\nrecommended to me by an experienced officer as producing speedy relief,\r\nis a table-spoonful of chloride of lime dissolved in a bottle of water,\r\nand administered as in the other case.\r\n\r\n\r\nRATTLESNAKE BITES.\r\n\r\nUpon the southern routes to California rattlesnakes are often met with,\r\nbut it is seldom that any person is bitten by them; yet this is a\r\npossible contingency, and it can never be amiss to have an antidote at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nHartshorn applied externally to the wound, and drunk in small\r\nquantities diluted with water whenever the patient becomes faint or\r\nexhausted from the effects of the poison, is one of the most common\r\nremedies.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of all medicines, a string or ligature should at once be\r\nbound firmly above the puncture, then scarify deeply with a knife, suck\r\nout the poison, and spit out the saliva.\r\n\r\nAndersson, in his book on Southwestern Africa, says: \"In the Cape\r\nColony the Dutch farmers resort to a cruel but apparently effective\r\nplan to counteract the bad effects of a serpent's bite. An incision\r\nhaving been made in the breast of a living fowl, the bitten part is\r\napplied to the wound. If the poison be very deadly, the bird soon\r\nevinces symptoms of distress, becomes drowsy, droops its head, and\r\ndies. It is replaced by a second, a third, and more if requisite. When,\r\nhowever, the bird no longer exhibits any of the signs just mentioned,\r\nthe patient is considered out of danger. A frog similarly applied is\r\nsupposed to be equally efficacious.\"\r\n\r\nHaunberg, in his Travels in South Africa, mentions an antidote against\r\nthe bite of serpents. He says: \"The blood of the turtle was much cried\r\nup, which, on account of this extraordinary virtue, the inhabitants dry\r\nin the form of small scales or membranes, and carry about them when\r\nthey travel in this country, which swarms with this most noxious\r\nvermin. Whenever any one is wounded by a serpent, he takes a couple of\r\npinches of the dried blood internally, and applies a little of it to\r\nthe wound.\"\r\n\r\nI was present upon one occasion when an Indian child was struck in the\r\nfore finger by a large rattlesnake. His mother, who was near at the\r\ntime, seized him in her arms, and, placing the wounded finger in her\r\nmouth, sucked the poison from the puncture for some minutes, repeatedly\r\nspitting out the saliva; after which she chewed and mashed some\r\nplantain leaves and applied to the wound. Over this she sprinkled some\r\nfinely-powdered tobacco, and wrapped the finger up in a rag. I did not\r\nobserve that the child suffered afterward the least pain or\r\ninconvenience. The immediate application of the remedies probably saved\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nIrritation from the bite of gnats and musquitoes, etc., may be relieved\r\nby chewing the plantain, and rubbing the spittle on the bite.\r\n\r\nI knew of another instance near Fort Towson, in Northern Texas, where a\r\nsmall child was left upon the earthen floor of a cabin while its mother\r\nwas washing at a spring near by. She heard a cry of distress, and, on\r\ngoing to the cabin, what was her horror on seeing a rattlesnake coiled\r\naround the child's arm, and striking it repeatedly with its fangs.\r\nAfter killing the snake, she hurried to her nearest neighbor, procured\r\na bottle of brandy, and returned as soon as possible; but the poison\r\nhad already so operated upon the arm that it was as black as a negro's.\r\nShe poured down the child's throat a huge draught of the liquor, which\r\nsoon took effect, making it very drunk, and stopped the action of the\r\npoison. Although the child was relieved, it remained sick for a long\r\ntime, but ultimately recovered.\r\n\r\nA man was struck in the leg by a very large rattlesnake near Fort\r\nBelknap, Texas, in 1853. No other remedy being at hand, a small piece\r\nof indigo was pulverized, made into a poultice with water, and applied\r\nto the puncture. It seemed to draw out the poison, turning the indigo\r\nwhite, after which it was removed and another poultice applied. These\r\napplications were repeated until the indigo ceased to change its color.\r\nThe man was then carried to the hospital at Fort Belknap, and soon\r\nrecovered, and the surgeon of the post pronounced it a very\r\nsatisfactory cure.\r\n\r\nA Chickasaw woman, who was bitten upon the foot near Fort Washita by a\r\nground rattlesnake (a very venomous species), drank a bottle of whisky\r\nand applied the indigo poultice, and when I saw her, three days\r\nafterward, she was recovering, but the flesh around the wound sloughed\r\naway.\r\n\r\nA Delaware remedy, which is said to be efficacious, is to burn powder\r\nupon the wound, but I have never known it to be tried excepting upon a\r\nhorse. In this case it was successful, or, at all events, the animal\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nOf all the remedies known to me, I should decidedly prefer ardent\r\nspirits. It is considered a sovereign antidote among our Western\r\nfrontier settlers, and I would make use of it with great confidence. It\r\nmust be taken until the patient becomes very much intoxicated, and this\r\nrequires a large quantity, as the action of the poison seems to\r\ncounteract its effects.\r\n\r\nShould the fangs of the snake penetrate deep enough to reach an artery,\r\nit is probable the person would die in a short time. I imagine,\r\nhowever, that this does not often occur.\r\n\r\nThe following remedial measures for the treatment of the bites of\r\npoisonous reptiles are recommended by Dr. Philip Weston in the London\r\nLancet for July, 1859:\r\n\r\n1. The application of a ligature round the limb close to the wound,\r\nbetween it and the heart, to arrest the return of venous blood.\r\n\r\n2. Excision of the bitten parts, or free incision through the wounds\r\nmade by the poison-teeth, subsequently encouraging the bleeding by warm\r\nsolutions to favor the escape of the poison from the circulation.\r\n\r\n3. Cauterization widely round the limb of the bite with a strong\r\nsolution of nitrate of silver, one drachm to the ounce, to prevent the\r\nintroduction of the poison into the system by the lymphatics.\r\n\r\n4. As soon as indications of the absorption of the poison into the\r\ncirculation begin to manifest themselves, the internal administration\r\nof ammonia in aerated or soda-water every quarter of an hour, to\r\nsupport the nervous energy and allay the distressing thirst.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" he continues, \"there is yet wanting some remedy that shall\r\nrapidly counteract the poison introduced into the blood, and assist in\r\nexpelling it from the system. The well-authenticated accounts of the\r\nsuccess attending the internal use of arsenic in injuries arising from\r\nthe bites of venomous reptiles in the East and West Indies, and also in\r\nAfrica, and the well-known properties of this medicine as a powerful\r\ntonic and alterative in conditions of impaired vitality of the blood\r\narising from the absorption of certain blood-poisons, would lead me to\r\ninclude this agent in the treatment already mentioned. It should be\r\nadministered in combination with ammonia, in full doses, frequently\r\nrepeated, so as to neutralize quickly the poison circulating in the\r\nblood before it can be eliminated from the system. This could readily\r\nbe accomplished by adding ten to fifteen minims of Fowler's solution to\r\nthe compound spirit of ammonia, to be given every quarter of an hour in\r\naerated or soda-water, until the vomiting and the more urgent symptoms\r\nof collapse have subsided, subsequently repeating the dose at longer\r\nintervals until reaction had become fully established, and the patient\r\nrelieved by copious bilious dejections.\"\r\n\r\n_Cedron_, which is a nut that grows on the Isthmus of Panama, and which\r\nis sold by the druggists in New York, is said to be an infallible\r\nantidote to serpent-bites. In the _Bullet. de l'Acad. de Med._ for\r\nFebruary, 1858, it is stated that a man was bitten at Panama by a\r\n_coral snake_, the most poisonous species on the Isthmus. During the\r\nfew seconds that it took him to take the cedron from his bag, he was\r\nseized with violent pains at the heart and throat; but he had scarcely\r\nchewed and swallowed a piece of the nut about the size of a small bean,\r\nwhen the pains ceased as by magic. He chewed a little more, and applied\r\nit externally to the wound, when the pains disappeared, and were\r\nfollowed by a copious evacuation of a substance like curdled milk. Many\r\nother cases are mentioned where the cedron proved an antidote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nBivouacs. Tente d'Abri. Gutta-percha Knapsack Tent. Comanche Lodge.\r\nSibley Tent.

Indian Sagacity.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIVOUACS AND TENTS.\r\n\r\nIn traveling with pack animals it is not always convenient or\r\npracticable to transport tents, and the traveler's ingenuity is often\r\ntaxed in devising the most available means for making himself\r\ncomfortable and secure against winds and storms. I have often been\r\nastonished to see how soon an experienced voyager, without any\r\nresources save those provided by nature, will erect a comfortable\r\nshelter in a place where a person having no knowledge of woodcraft\r\nwould never think of such a thing.\r\n\r\nAlmost all people in different parts of the world have their own\r\npeculiar methods of bivouacking.\r\n\r\nIn the severe climate of Thibet, Dr. Hooker informs us that they encamp\r\nnear large rocks, which absorb the heat during the day, and give it out\r\nslowly during the night. They form, as it were, reservoirs of caloric,\r\nthe influence of which is exceedingly grateful during a cold night.\r\n\r\nIn the polar regions the Esquimaux live and make themselves comfortable\r\nin huts of ice or snow, and with no other combustible but oil.\r\n\r\nThe natives of Australia bury their bodies in the sand, keeping their\r\nheads only above the surface, and thus sleep warm during the chilly\r\nnights of that climate.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the health and comfort of travelers upon the Plains,\r\nthe atmosphere is pure and dry during the greater part of the year, and\r\nit is seldom that any rain or dew is seen; neither are there marshes or\r\nponds of stagnant water to generate putrid exhalations and poisonous\r\nmalaria. The night air of the summer months is soft, exhilarating, and\r\ndelightful. Persons may therefore sleep in it and inhale it with\r\nperfect impunity, and, indeed, many prefer this to breathing the\r\nconfined atmosphere of a house or tent.\r\n\r\nDuring the rainy season only is it necessary to seek shelter. In\r\ntraveling with covered wagons one always has protection from storms,\r\nbut with pack trains it becomes necessary to improvise the best\r\nsubstitutes for tents.\r\n\r\nA very secure protection against storms may be constructed by planting\r\nfirmly in the ground two upright poles, with forks at their tops, and\r\ncrossing them with a light pole laid in the forks. A gutta-percha\r\ncloth, or sheet of canvas, or, in the absence of either of these two,\r\nblankets, may be attached by one side to the horizontal pole, the\r\nopposite edge being stretched out to the windward at an angle of about\r\nforty-five degrees to the ground, and there fastened with wooden pins,\r\nor with buckskin strings tied to the lower border of the cloth and to\r\npegs driven firmly into the earth. This forms a shelter for three or\r\nfour men, and is a good defense against winds and rains. If a fire be\r\nthen made in front, the smoke will be carried away, so as not to\r\nincommode the occupants of the bivouac.\r\n\r\nThis is called a \"half-faced\" camp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HALF-FACED CAMP.]\r\n\r\nAnother method practiced a great deal among mountain men and Indians\r\nconsists in placing several rough poles equidistant around in a half\r\ncircle, and bringing the small ends together at the top, where they are\r\nbound with a thong. This forms the conical frame-work of the bivouac,\r\nwhich, when covered with a cloth stretched around it, makes a very good\r\nshelter, and is preferable to the half-faced camp, because the sides\r\nare covered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONICAL BIVOUAC.]\r\n\r\nWhen no cloths, blankets, or hides are at hand to be placed over the\r\npoles of the lodge, it may be covered with green boughs laid on\r\ncompactly, so as to shed a good deal of rain, and keep out the wind in\r\ncold weather. We adopted this description of shelter in crossing the\r\nRocky Mountains during the winter of 1857-8, and thus formed a very\r\neffectual protection against the bleak winds which sweep with great\r\nviolence over those lofty and inhospitable _sierras_. We always\r\nselected a dense thicket for our encampment, and covered the lodges\r\nwith a heavy coating of pine boughs, wattling them together as\r\ncompactly as possible, and piling snow upon the outside in such a\r\nmanner as to make them quite impervious to the wind. The fires were\r\nthen kindled at the mouths of the lodges, and our heads and bodies were\r\ncompletely sheltered, while our feet were kept warm by the fires.\r\n\r\nThe French troops, while serving in the Crimea, used what they call the\r\n_tente d'abri_, or shelter tent, which seems to have been received with\r\ngreat favor in Europe. It is composed of two, four, or six square\r\npieces of cloth, with buttons and buttonholes adjusted upon the edges,\r\nand is pitched by planting two upright stakes in the ground at a\r\ndistance corresponding with the length of the canvas when buttoned\r\ntogether. The two sticks are connected by a cord passed around the top\r\nof each, drawn tight, and the ends made fast to pins driven firmly into\r\nthe ground. The canvas is then laid over the rope between the sticks,\r\nspread out at an angle of about forty-five degrees, and the lower edges\r\nsecured to the earth with wooden pins. This makes some defense against\r\nthe weather, and was the only shelter enjoyed by the mass of the French\r\narmy in the Crimea up to October, 1855. For a permanent camp it is\r\nusual to excavate a shallow basement under the tent, and to bank up the\r\nearth on the outside in cold weather. It is designed that upon marches\r\nthe _tente d'abri_ shall be taken to pieces and carried by the\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nA tent has recently been prepared by Mr. John Rider, 165 Broadway, New\r\nYork, which is called the \"_tent knapsack_.\" It has been examined by a\r\nboard of army officers, and recommended for adoption in our military\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TENT KNAPSACK.]\r\n\r\nThis tent is somewhat similar to the _tente d'abri_, and is pitched in\r\nthe same manner, but it has this advantage, that each separate piece\r\nmay be converted into a water-proof knapsack.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from the Report of the Board go to show that\r\nthis tent knapsack will be useful to parties traveling on the prairies\r\nwith pack trains:\r\n\r\n\"It is a piece of gutta-percha 5 feet 3 inches long, and 3 feet 8\r\ninches wide, with double edges on one side, and brass studs and\r\nbutton-holes along two edges, and straps and buckles on the fourth\r\nedge; the whole weighing three pounds; two sticks, 3 feet 8 inches long\r\nby 1-1/4 inches in diameter, and a small cord. When used as a knapsack,\r\nthe clothing is packed in a cotton bag, and the gutta-percha sheet is\r\nfolded round it, lapping at the ends. The clothing is thus protected by\r\ntwo or three thicknesses of gutta-percha, and in this respect there is\r\na superiority over the knapsack now used by our troops. Other\r\nadvantages are, that the tent knapsack has no seams, the parts at which\r\nthose in use wear out soonest; it adapts itself to the size of the\r\ncontents, so that a compact and portable bundle can be made, whether\r\nthe kit be entire or not; and, with the cotton bag, it forms a\r\nconvenient, commodious, and durable receptacle for all a soldier's\r\nclothing and necessaries.\r\n\r\n\"On a scout a soldier usually carries only a blanket, overcoat, and at\r\nmost a single shirt, pair of drawers, and a pair of socks, all of which\r\ncan be packed in the tent knapsack in a small bundle, perfectly\r\nprotected from rain, and capable of being suspended from the shoulders\r\nand carried with comfort and ease during a march.\r\n\r\n\"2d. As a shelter. The studs and eyelets along two edges of the tent\r\nknapsack are for the purpose of fastening a number of them together,\r\nand thus making a sheet of larger dimensions.\r\n\r\n\"A sheet formed by fastening together four knapsacks was exhibited to\r\nthe Board, stretched upon a frame of wood. When used in service the\r\nsheet is to be stretched on a rope supported by two poles, or by two\r\nrifles, muskets, or carbines, and pinned down at the sides with six\r\npins, three on each side.\r\n\r\n\"The sheet of four knapsacks is 10 feet 6 inches long, and 7 feet 4\r\ninches wide, and when pitched on a rope 4 feet 4 inches above the\r\nground, covers a horizontal space 6 feet 6 inches wide, and 7 feet 4\r\ninches long, which will accommodate five men, and may be made to\r\nshelter seven. The sheet can also be used on the ground, and is a great\r\nprotection from dampness, and as a shawl or talma; indeed, a variety of\r\nadvantageous uses to which the gutta-percha sheet may be put will\r\nsuggest themselves to persons using it.\r\n\r\n\"The Board is satisfied with its merits in all the uses to which it is\r\nproposed to be put, and is of opinion that the gutta-percha tent\r\nknapsack may be adopted in the military service with advantage.\"\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThe usual tenement of the prairie tribes, and of the traders, trappers,\r\nand hunters who live among them, is the Comanche lodge, which is made\r\nof eight straight peeled poles about twenty feet long, covered with\r\nhides or cloth. The lodge is pitched by connecting the smaller\r\nextremities of three of the poles with one end of a long line. The\r\nthree poles are then raised perpendicularly, and the larger extremities\r\nspread out in a tripod to the circumference of the circle that is to\r\nform the base of the lodge. The other poles are then raised, laid into\r\nthe forks of the three first, and spread out equidistant upon the\r\ncircle, thus forming the conical framework of the structure. Nine or\r\nten poles are generally used in one lodge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMANCHE LODGE.]\r\n\r\nThe long line attached to the tripod is then wound several times around\r\nthe top, where the poles intersect, and the lower end made fast at the\r\nbase of the lodge, thus securing the frame firmly in its position. The\r\ncovering, made of buffalo hides, dressed without the hair, and cut and\r\nsewed together to fit the conical frame, is raised with a pole, spread\r\nout around the structure, and united at the edges with sharpened wooden\r\npegs, leaving sufficient space open at the bottom for a doorway, which\r\nmay be closed with a blanket spread out with two small sticks, and\r\nsuspended over the opening.\r\n\r\nThe lower edge of the lodge is made fast to the ground with wooden\r\npins. The apex is left open, with a triangular wing or flap on each\r\nside, and the windward flap constantly stretched out by means of a pole\r\ninserted into a pocket in the end of it, which causes it to draw like a\r\nsail, and thus occasions a draught from the fire built upon the ground\r\nin the centre of the lodge, and makes it warm and comfortable in the\r\ncoldest winter weather. Canvas makes a very good substitute for the\r\nbuffalo-skin covering.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIBLEY TENT.\r\n\r\nA tent has been invented by Major H. H. Sibley, of the army, which is\r\nknown as the \"_Sibley tent_.\" It is somewhat similar to the Comanche\r\nlodge, but in place of the conical frame-work of poles it has but one\r\nupright standard, resting upon an iron tripod in the centre. The tripod\r\ncan be used to suspend cooking utensils over the fire, and, when folded\r\nup, admits the wooden standard between the legs, thereby reducing the\r\nlength one half, and making it more convenient for packing and\r\ntraveling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SIBLEY TENT.]\r\n\r\nThis tent constituted the entire shelter of the army in Utah during the\r\nwinter of 1857-8, and, notwithstanding the severity of the climate in\r\nthe elevated locality of Camp Scott, the troops were quite comfortable,\r\nand pleased with the tent.\r\n\r\nIn permanent camps the Sibley tent may be so pitched as to give more\r\nroom by erecting a tripod upon the outside with three poles high and\r\nstout enough to admit of the tent's being suspended by ropes attached\r\nto the apex. This method dispenses with the necessity of the central\r\nupright standard.\r\n\r\nWhen the weather is very cold, the tent may be made warmer by\r\nexcavating a basement about three feet deep, which also gives a wall to\r\nthe tent, making it more roomy.\r\n\r\nThe tent used in the army will shelter comfortably twelve men.\r\n\r\nCaptain G. Rhodes, of the English army, in his recent work upon tents\r\nand tent-life, has given a description of most of the tents used in the\r\ndifferent armies in Europe, but, in my judgment, none of them, in point\r\nof convenience, comfort, and economy, will compare with the Sibley tent\r\nfor campaigning in cold weather. One of its most important features,\r\nthat of admitting of a fire within it and of causing a draught by the\r\ndisposition of the wings, is not, that I am aware, possessed by any\r\nother tent. Moreover, it is exempt from the objections that are urged\r\nagainst some other tents on account of insalubrity from want of top\r\nventilation to carry off the impure air during the night.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMP FURNITURE.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustrations present some convenient articles of\r\nportable camp furniture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAMP CHAIR. NO. 1.]\r\n\r\nCAMP CHAIR NO. 1 is of oak or other hard wood. Fig. 1 represents it\r\nopened for use; in Fig. 2 it is closed for transportation. _A_ is a\r\nstout canvas, forming the back and seat; _b_, _b_, _b_ are iron\r\nbutt-hinges; _c_, _c_ are leather straps, one inch and a quarter wide,\r\nforming the arms; _d_ is an iron rod, with nut and screw at one end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAMP CHAIRS. NOS. 2 AND 3.]\r\n\r\nCAMP CHAIR NO. 2 is made of sticks tied together with thongs of\r\nbuckskin or raw hide.\r\n\r\nCAMP CHAIR NO. 3 is a very comfortable seat, made of a barrel, the part\r\nforming the seat being filled with grass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAMP TABLE.]\r\n\r\nCAMP TABLE. Fig. 1 represents the table folded for transportation; in\r\nFig. 2 it is spread out for use. _A_ is the top of the table; _a_, _a_\r\nare side boards, and _c_, _c_ are end boards, turning on butt-hinges,\r\n_b_, _b_, _b_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIELD COT. NO. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIELD COT. NO. 2.]\r\n\r\nFIELD COTS. In No. 1, _A_ represents the cot put up for use; _B_, the\r\ncot folded for transportation. The legs turn upon iron bolts running\r\nthrough the head and foot boards; they are then placed upon the canvas,\r\nand the whole is rolled up around the side pieces. In No. 2 the upper\r\nfigure represents the cot put up for use; the lower shows it folded for\r\ntransportation. _A_ is a stout canvas; _b_, _b_ are iron butt-hinges;\r\n_c_, _c_, the legs; _d_, _d_, leather straps, with buckles, which hold\r\nthe legs firm; _f_, _f_, ends, which fold upon hinges; _g_, _g_,\r\ncross-bars from leg to leg. This cot is strong, light, and portable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAMP BUREAU.]\r\n\r\nCAMP BUREAU. This cut represents two chests, _A_, _A_, with their\r\nhandles, a, a; the covers taken off, they are placed one upon the\r\nother, and secured by the clamps _B_, _B_; _d_ shows the division\r\nbetween the two chests. When it is to be transported, the knobs, _c_,\r\nare unscrewed from the drawers, the looking-glass, _f_, is removed, the\r\ndrawers are filled with clothing, etc., and the lids are screwed on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MESS-CHEST.]\r\n\r\nMESS-CHEST. A represents the chest open for table; _B_ is the same\r\nclosed; _C_ is the upper tray of tin, with compartments, _b_, _b_; _E_\r\nis the lower wooden tray, divided into compartments, _a_, _a_, for\r\nvarious purposes, and made fast to the bottom of the chest; _d_, _d_\r\nare lids opening with hinges; _f_ (in figure B) is a wooden leg,\r\nturning upon a hinge, and fitting snugly between two pieces of wood\r\nscrewed upon the cover.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTERS.\r\n\r\nShould a party traveling with pack animals, and without ambulances or\r\nwagons, have one of its members wounded or taken so sick as to be\r\nunable to walk or ride on horseback, a litter may be constructed by\r\ntaking two poles about twenty feet in length, uniting them by two\r\nsticks three feet long lashed across the centre at six feet apart, and\r\nstretching a piece of stout canvas, a blanket, or hide between them to\r\nform the bed. Two steady horses or mules are then selected, placed\r\nbetween the poles in the front and rear of the litter, and the ends of\r\nthe poles made fast to the sides of the animals, either by attachment\r\nto the stirrups or to the ends of straps secured over their backs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORSE-LITTER.]\r\n\r\nThe patient may then be placed upon the litter, and is ready for the\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\nThe elasticity of the long poles gives an easy motion to the\r\nconveyance, and makes this method of locomotion much more comfortable\r\nthan might be supposed.\r\n\r\nThe prairie Indians have a way of transporting their sick and children\r\nupon a litter very similar in construction to the one just described,\r\nexcepting that one animal is used instead of two. One end of the litter\r\nis made fast to the sides of the animal, while the other end is left to\r\ntrail upon the ground. A projection is raised for the feet to rest\r\nagainst and prevent the patient from sliding down. Instead of canvas,\r\nthe Indians sometimes lash a large willow basket across the poles, in\r\nwhich they place the person to be transported. The animals harnessed to\r\nthe litter must be carefully conducted upon the march, and caution used\r\nin passing over rough and broken ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAND-LITTER.]\r\n\r\nA very convenient and comfortable method of packing a sick or wounded\r\nman when there are no animals disposable, and which is sometimes\r\nresorted to by the Indians, is to take two small poles about ten feet\r\nlong, and lash three cross-pieces to them, one in the centre, and the\r\nother two about eighteen inches from the ends. A blanket or hide is\r\nthen secured firmly to this frame, and the patient placed upon it under\r\nthe centre cross-piece, which prevents him from falling out. Two men\r\nact as carriers, walking between the ends of the long poles. The\r\npatient may be protected against the rain or sun by bending small\r\nwillows over the frame, and covering them with a cloth.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAPID TRAVELING.\r\n\r\nSmall parties with good animals, light vehicles, and little lading, may\r\ntraverse the Plains rapidly and comfortably, if the following\r\ninjunctions be observed.\r\n\r\nThe day's drive should commence as soon as it is light, and, where the\r\nroad is good, the animals kept upon a slow trot for about three hours,\r\nthen immediately turned out upon the best grass that can be found for\r\ntwo hours, thus giving time for grazing and breakfast. After which\r\nanother drive of about three hours may be made, making the noon halt\r\nabout three hours, when the animals are again harnessed, and the\r\njourney continued until night.\r\n\r\nIn passing through a country infested by hostile Indians, the evening\r\ndrive should be prolonged until an hour or two after dark, turning off\r\nat a point where the ground is hard, going about half a mile from the\r\nroad, and encamping without fires, in low ground, where the Indians\r\nwill find it difficult to track or see the party.\r\n\r\nThese frequent halts serve to rest and recruit the animals so that they\r\nwill, without injury, make from thirty to forty miles a day for a long\r\ntime. This, however, can only be done with very light loads and\r\nvehicles, such, for example, as an ambulance with four mules, only\r\nthree or four persons, and a small amount of luggage.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUEL AND FIRE.\r\n\r\nThere are long distances upon some of the routes to California where no\r\nother fuel is found but the dried dung of the buffalo, called by the\r\nmountaineers \"chips,\" and by the French \"bois de vache,\" the _argul_ of\r\nthe Tartary deserts. It burns well when perfectly dry, answers a good\r\npurpose for cooking, and some men even prefer it to wood. As it will\r\nnot burn when wet, it is well, in a country where no other fuel can be\r\nhad, when it threatens to rain, for the traveler to collect a supply\r\nbefore the rain sets in, and carry it in wagons to the camp. When dry,\r\nthe chips are easily lighted.\r\n\r\nA great saving in fuel may be made by digging a trench about two feet\r\nlong by eight inches in width and depth; the fires are made in the\r\nbottom of the trench, and the cooking utensils placed upon the top,\r\nwhere they receive all the heat. This plan is especially recommended\r\nfor windy weather, and it is convenient at all times. The wood should\r\nbe cut short, and split into small pieces.\r\n\r\nIt is highly important that travelers should know the different methods\r\nthat may be resorted to for kindling fires upon a march.\r\n\r\nThe most simple and most expeditious of these is by using the lucifer\r\nmatches; but, unless they are kept in well-corked bottles, they are\r\nliable to become wet, and will then fail to ignite.\r\n\r\nThe most of those found in the shops easily imbibe dampness, and are of\r\nbut little use in the prairies. Those marked \"Van Duser, New York,\" and\r\nput up in flat rectangular boxes, are the best I have met with, and\r\nwere the only ones I saw which were not affected by the humid climate\r\nof Mexico. Wax lucifers are better than wooden, as they are impervious\r\nto moisture.\r\n\r\nI have seen an Indian start a fire with flint and steel after others\r\nhad failed to do it with matches. This was during a heavy rain, when\r\nalmost all available fuel had become wet. On such occasions dry fuel\r\nmay generally be obtained under logs, rocks, or leaning trees.\r\n\r\nThe inner bark of some dry trees, cedar for instance, is excellent to\r\nkindle a fire. The bark is rubbed in the hand until the fibres are made\r\nfine and loose, when it takes fire easily; dry grass or leaves are also\r\ngood. After a sufficient quantity of small kindling fuel has been\r\ncollected, a moistened rag is rubbed with powder, and a spark struck\r\ninto it with a flint and steel, which will ignite it; this is then\r\nplaced in the centre of the loose nest of inflammable material, and\r\nwhirled around in the air until it bursts out into a flame. When it is\r\nraining, the blaze should be laid upon the dryest spot that can be\r\nfound, a blanket held over it to keep off the water, and it is fed with\r\nvery small bits of dry wood and shavings until it has gained sufficient\r\nstrength to burn the larger damp wood. When no dry place can be found,\r\nthe fire may be started in a kettle or frying-pan, and afterward\r\ntransferred to the ground.\r\n\r\nShould there be no other means of starting a fire, it can always be\r\nmade with a gun or pistol, by placing upon the ground a rag saturated\r\nwith damp powder, and a little dry powder sprinkled over it. The gun or\r\npistol is then (uncharged) placed with the cone directly over and near\r\nthe rag, and a cap exploded, which will invariably ignite it. Another\r\nmethod is by placing about one fourth of a charge of powder into a gun,\r\npushing a rag down loosely upon it, and firing it out with the muzzle\r\ndown near the ground, which ignites the rag.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult of all methods of making a fire, but one that is\r\npracticed by some of the Western Indians, is by friction between two\r\npieces of wood. I had often heard of this process, but never gave\r\ncredit to its practicability until I saw the experiment successfully\r\ntried. It was done in the following manner: Two dried stalks of the\r\nMexican soap-plant, about three fourths of an inch in diameter, were\r\nselected, and one of them made flat on one side; near the edge of this\r\nflat surface a very small indentation was made to receive the end of\r\nthe other stick, and a groove cut from this down the side. The other\r\nstick is cut with a rounded end, and placed upright upon the first. One\r\nman then holds the horizontal piece upon the ground, while another\r\ntakes the vertical stick between the palms of his hands, and turns it\r\nback and forth as rapidly as possible, at the same time pressing\r\nforcibly down upon it. The point of the upright stick wears away the\r\nindentation into a fine powder, which runs off to the ground in the\r\ngroove that has been cut; after a time it begins to smoke, and by\r\ncontinued friction it will at length take fire.\r\n\r\nThis is an operation that is difficult, and requires practice; but if a\r\ndrill-stick is used with a cord placed around the centre of the upright\r\nstick, it can be turned much more rapidly than with the hands, and the\r\nfire produced more readily. The upright stick may be of any hard, dry\r\nwood, but the lower horizontal stick must be of a soft, inflammable\r\nnature, such as pine, cottonwood, or black walnut, and it must be\r\nperfectly dry. The Indians work the sticks with the palms of the hands,\r\nholding the lower piece between the feet; but it is better to have a\r\nman to hold the lower piece while another man works the drill-bow.\r\n\r\nInexperienced travelers are very liable, in kindling fires at their\r\ncamp, to ignite the grass around them. Great caution should be taken to\r\nguard against the occurrence of such accidents, as they might prove\r\nexceedingly disastrous. We were very near having our entire train of\r\nwagons and supplies destroyed, upon one occasion, by the carelessness\r\nof one of our party in setting fire to the grass, and it was only by\r\nthe most strenuous and well-timed efforts of two hundred men in setting\r\ncounter fires, and burning around the train, that it was saved. When\r\nthe grass is dry it will take fire like powder, and if thick and tall,\r\nwith a brisk wind, the flames run like a race-horse, sweeping every\r\nthing before them. A lighted match, or the ashes from a segar or pipe,\r\nthrown carelessly into the dry grass, sometimes sets it on fire; but\r\nthe greatest danger lies in kindling camp-fires.\r\n\r\nTo prevent accidents of this kind, before kindling the fire a space\r\nshould be cleared away sufficient to embrace the limits of the flame,\r\nand all combustibles removed therefrom, and while the fire is being\r\nmade men should be stationed around with blankets ready to put it out\r\nif it takes the grass.\r\n\r\nWhen a fire is approaching, and escape from its track is impossible, it\r\nmay be repelled in the following manner: The train and animals are\r\nparked compactly together; then several men, provided with blankets,\r\nset fire to the grass on the lee side, burning it away gradually from\r\nthe train, and extinguishing it on the side next the train. This can\r\neasily be done, and the fire controlled with the blankets, or with dry\r\nsand thrown upon it, until an area large enough to give room for the\r\ntrain has been burned clear. Now the train moves on to this ground of\r\nsafety, and the fire passes by harmless.\r\n\r\n\r\nJERKING MEAT.\r\n\r\nSo pure is the atmosphere in the interior of our continent that fresh\r\nmeat may be cured, or _jerked,_ as it is termed in the language of\r\nthe prairies, by cutting it into strips about an inch thick, and\r\nhanging it in the sun, where in a few days it will dry so well that it\r\nmay be packed in sacks, and transported over long journeys without\r\nputrefying.\r\n\r\nWhen there is not time to jerk the meat by the slow process described,\r\nit may be done in a few hours by building an open frame-work of small\r\nsticks about two feet above the ground, placing the strips of meat upon\r\nthe top of it, and keeping up a slow fire beneath, which dries the meat\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nThe jerking process may be done upon the march without any loss of time\r\nby stretching lines from front to rear upon the outside of loaded\r\nwagons, and suspending the meat upon them, where it is allowed to\r\nremain until sufficiently cured to be packed away. Salt is never used\r\nin this process, and is not required, as the meat, if kept dry, rarely\r\nputrefies.\r\n\r\nIf travelers have ample transportation, it will be a wise precaution,\r\nin passing through the buffalo range, to lay in a supply of jerked meat\r\nfor future exigences.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARIATS.\r\n\r\nIt frequently happens upon long journeys that the lariat ropes wear out\r\nor are lost, and if there were no means of replacing them great\r\ninconvenience might result therefrom. A very good substitute may be\r\nmade by taking the green hide of a buffalo, horse, mule, or ox,\r\nstretching it upon the ground, and pinning it down by the edges. After\r\nit has been well stretched, a circle is described with a piece of\r\ncharcoal, embracing as much of the skin as practicable, and a strip\r\nabout an inch wide cut from the outer edge of sufficient length to form\r\nthe lariat. The strip is then wrapped around between two trees or\r\nstakes, drawn tight, and left to dry, after which it is subjected to a\r\nprocess of friction until it becomes pliable, when it is ready for use;\r\nthis lariat answers well so long as it is kept dry, but after it has\r\nbeen wet and dried again it becomes very hard and unyielding. This,\r\nhowever, may be obviated by boiling it in oil or grease until\r\nthoroughly saturated, after which it remains pliable.\r\n\r\nThe Indians make very good lariat ropes of dressed buffalo or buck\r\nskins cut into narrow strips and braided; these, when oiled, slip much\r\nmore freely than the hemp or cotton ropes, and are better for lassoing\r\nanimals, but they are not as suitable for picketing as those made of\r\nother material, because the wolves will eat them, and thus set free the\r\nanimals to which they are attached.\r\n\r\n\r\nCACHES.\r\n\r\nIt not unfrequently happens that travelers are compelled, for want of\r\ntransportation, to abandon a portion of their luggage, and if it is\r\nexposed to the keen scrutiny of the thieving savages who often follow\r\nthe trail of a party, and hunt over old camps for such things as may be\r\nleft, it will be likely to be appropriated by them. Such contingencies\r\nhave given rise to a method of secreting articles called by the old\r\nFrench Canadian voyagers \"_caching_.\"\r\n\r\nThe proper places for making caches are in loose sandy soils, where the\r\nearth is dry and easily excavated. Near the bank of a river is the most\r\nconvenient for this purpose, as the earth taken out can be thrown into\r\nthe water, leaving no trace behind.\r\n\r\nWhen the spot has been chosen, the turf is carefully cut and laid\r\naside, after which a hole is dug in the shape of an egg, and of\r\nsufficient dimensions to contain the articles to be secreted, and the\r\nearth, as it is taken out, thrown upon a cloth or blanket, and carried\r\nto a stream or ravine, where it can be disposed of, being careful not\r\nto scatter any upon the ground near the cache. The hole is then lined\r\nwith bushes or dry grass, the articles placed within, covered with\r\ngrass, the hole filled up with earth, and the sods carefully placed\r\nback in their original position, and every thing that would be likely\r\nto attract an Indian's attention removed from the locality. If an\r\nIndia-rubber or gutta-percha cloth is disposable, it should be used to\r\nenvelop the articles in the cache.\r\n\r\nAnother plan of making a cache is to dig the hole inside a tent, and\r\noccupy the tent for some days after the goods are deposited. This\r\neffaces the marks of excavation.\r\n\r\nThe mountain traders were formerly in the habit of building fires over\r\ntheir caches, but the Indians have become so familiar with this\r\npractice that I should think it no longer safe.\r\n\r\nAnother method of caching which is sometimes resorted to is to place\r\nthe articles in the top of an evergreen tree, such as the pine,\r\nhemlock, or spruce. The thick boughs are so arranged around the\r\npackages that they can not be seen from beneath, and they are tied to a\r\nlimb to prevent them from being blown out by the wind. This will only\r\nanswer for such articles as will not become injured by the weather.\r\n\r\nCaves or holes in the rocks that are protected from the rains are also\r\nsecure deposits for caching goods, but in every case care must be taken\r\nto obliterate all tracks or other indications of men having been near\r\nthem. These caches will be more secure when made at some distance from\r\nroads or trails, and in places where Indians would not be likely to\r\npass.\r\n\r\nTo find a cache again, the bearing and distance from the centre of it\r\nto some prominent object, such as a mound, rock, or tree, should be\r\ncarefully determined and recorded, so that any one, on returning to the\r\nspot, would have no difficulty in ascertaining its position.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISPOSITION OF FIRE-ARMS.\r\n\r\nThe mountaineers and trappers exercise a very wise precaution, on\r\nlaying down for the night, by placing their arms and ammunition by\r\ntheir sides, where they can be seized at a moment's notice. This rule\r\nis never departed from, and they are therefore seldom liable to be\r\nsurprised. In Parkyns's \"Abyssinia,\" I find the following remarks upon\r\nthis subject:\r\n\r\n\"When getting sleepy, you return your rifle between your legs, roll\r\nover, and go to sleep. Some people may think this is a queer place for\r\na rifle; but, on the contrary, it is the position of all others where\r\nutility and comfort are most combined. The butt rests on the arm, and\r\nserves as a pillow for the head; the muzzle points between the knees,\r\nand the arms encircle the lock and breech, so that you have a smooth\r\npillow, and are always prepared to start up armed at a moment's\r\nnotice.\"\r\n\r\nI have never made the experiment of sleeping in this way, but I should\r\nimagine that a gun-stock would make rather a hard pillow.\r\n\r\nMany of our experienced frontier officers prefer carrying their pistols\r\nin a belt at their sides to placing them in holsters attached to the\r\nsaddle, as in the former case they are always at hand when they are\r\ndismounted; whereas, by the other plan, they become useless when a man\r\nis unhorsed, unless he has time to remove them from the saddle, which,\r\nduring the excitement of an action, would seldom be the case.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Colt's army and navy sized revolvers have been in use\r\nfor a long time in our army, officers are by no means of one mind as to\r\ntheir relative merits for frontier service. The navy pistol, being more\r\nlight and portable, is more convenient for the belt, but it is very\r\nquestionable in my mind whether these qualities counterbalance the\r\nadvantages derived from the greater weight of powder and lead that can\r\nbe fired from the larger pistol, and the consequent increased\r\nprojectile force.\r\n\r\nThis point is illustrated by an incident which fell under my own\r\nobservation. In passing near the \"Medicine-Bow Butte\" during the spring\r\nof 1858, I most unexpectedly encountered and fired at a full-grown\r\ngrizzly bear; but, as my horse had become somewhat blown by a previous\r\ngallop, his breathing so much disturbed my aim that I missed the animal\r\nat the short distance of about fifty yards, and he ran off. Fearful, if\r\nI stopped to reload my rifle, the bear would make his escape, I\r\nresolved to drive him back to the advanced guard of our escort, which I\r\ncould see approaching in the distance; this I succeeded in doing, when\r\nseveral mounted men, armed with the navy revolvers, set off in pursuit.\r\nThey approached within a few paces, and discharged ten or twelve shots,\r\nthe most of which entered the animal, but he still kept on, and his\r\nprogress did not seem materially impeded by the wounds. After these men\r\nhad exhausted their charges, another man rode up armed with the army\r\nrevolver, and fired two shots, which brought the stalwart beast to the\r\nground. Upon skinning him and making an examination of the wounds, it\r\nwas discovered that none of the balls from the small pistols had, after\r\npassing through his thick and tough hide, penetrated deeper than about\r\nan inch into the flesh, but that the two balls from the large pistol\r\nhad gone into the vitals and killed him. This test was to my mind a\r\ndecisive one as to the relative efficiency of the two arms for frontier\r\nservice, and I resolved thenceforth to carry the larger size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GRIZZLY.]\r\n\r\nSeveral different methods are practiced in slinging and carrying\r\nfire-arms upon horseback. The shoulder-strap, with a swivel to hook\r\ninto a ring behind the guard, with the muzzle resting downward in a\r\nleather cup attached by a strap to the same staple as the\r\nstirrup-leather, is a very handy method for cavalry soldiers to sling\r\ntheir carbines; but, the gun being reversed, the jolting caused by the\r\nmotion of the horse tends to move the charge and shake the powder out\r\nof the cone, which renders it liable to burst the gun and to miss fire.\r\n\r\nAn invention of the Namaquas, in Africa, described by Galton in his Art\r\nof Travel, is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Sew a bag of canvas, leather, or hide, of such bigness as to admit the\r\nbutt of the gun pretty freely. The straps that support it buckle\r\nthrough a ring in the pommel, and the thongs by which its slope is\r\nadjusted fasten round the girth below. The exact adjustments may not be\r\nhit upon by an unpracticed person for some little time, but, when they\r\nare once ascertained, the straps need never be shifted. The gun is\r\nperfectly safe, and never comes below the arm-pit, even in taking a\r\ndrop leap; it is pulled out in an instant by bringing the elbow in\r\nfront of the gun and close to the side, so as to throw the gun to the\r\noutside of the arm; then, lowering the hand, the gun is caught up. It\r\nis a bungling way to take out the gun while its barrel lies between the\r\narm and the body. Any sized gun can be carried in this fashion. It\r\noffers no obstacle to mounting or dismounting.\"\r\n\r\nThis may be a convenient way of carrying the gun; I have never tried\r\nit. Of all methods I have used, I prefer, for hunting, a piece of\r\nleather about twelve inches by four, with a hole cut in each end; one\r\nof the ends is placed over the pommel of the saddle, and with a\r\nbuckskin string made fast to it, where it remains a permanent fixture.\r\nWhen the rider is mounted, he places his gun across the strap upon the\r\nsaddle, and carries the loose end forward over the pommel, the gun\r\nresting horizontally across his legs. It will now only be necessary\r\noccasionally to steady the gun with the hand. After a little practice\r\nthe rider will be able to control it with his knees, and it will be\r\nfound a very easy and convenient method of carrying it. When required\r\nfor use, it is taken out in an instant by simply raising it with the\r\nhand, when the loose end of the strap comes off the pommel.\r\n\r\nThe chief causes of accidents from the use of fire-arms arise from\r\ncarelessness, and I have always observed that those persons who are\r\nmost familiar with their use are invariably the most careful. Many\r\naccidents have happened from carrying guns with the cock down upon the\r\ncap. When in this position, a blow upon the cock, and sometimes the\r\nconcussion produced by the falling of the gun, will explode the cap;\r\nand, occasionally, when the cock catches a twig, or in the clothes, and\r\nlifts it from the cap, it will explode. With a gun at half-cock there\r\nis but little danger of such accidents; for, when the cock is drawn\r\nback, it either comes to the full-cock, and remains, or it returns to\r\nthe half-cock, but does not go down upon the cone. Another source of\r\nvery many sad and fatal accidents resulting from the most stupid and\r\nculpable carelessness is in persons standing before the muzzles of guns\r\nand attempting to pull them out of wagons, or to draw them through a\r\nfence or brush in the same position. If the cock encounters an obstacle\r\nin its passage, it will, of course, be drawn back and fall upon the\r\ncap. These accidents are of frequent occurrence, and the cause is well\r\nunderstood by all, yet men continue to disregard it, and their lives\r\npay the penalty of their indiscretion. It is a wise maxim, which\r\napplies with especial force in campaigning on the prairies, \"_Always\r\nlook to your gun, but never let your gun look at you._\"\r\n\r\nAn equally important maxim might be added to this: _Never to point\r\nyour gun at another, whether charged or uncharged, and never allow\r\nanother to point his gun at you._ Young men, before they become\r\naccustomed to the use of arms, are very apt to be careless, and a large\r\npercentage of gun accidents may be traced to this cause. That finished\r\nsportsman and wonderful shot, my friend Captain Martin Scott, than whom\r\na more gallant soldier never fought a battle, was the most careful man\r\nwith fire-arms I ever knew, and up to the time he received his\r\ndeath-wound upon the bloody field of Molino del Rey he never ceased his\r\ncautionary advice to young officers upon this subject. His extended\r\nexperience and intimate acquaintance with the use of arms had fully\r\nimpressed him with its importance, and no man ever lived whose opinions\r\nupon this subject should carry greater weight. As incomprehensible as\r\nit may appear to persons accustomed to the use of fire-arms, recruits\r\nare very prone, before they have been drilled at target practice with\r\nball cartridges, to place the ball below the powder in the piece.\r\nOfficers conducting detachments through the Indian country should\r\ntherefore give their special attention to this, and require the\r\nrecruits to tear the cartridge and pour all the powder into the piece\r\nbefore the ball is inserted.\r\n\r\nAs accidents often occur in camp from the accidental discharge of\r\nfire-arms that have been capped, I would recommend that the arms be\r\ncontinually kept loaded in campaigning, but the caps not placed upon\r\nthe cones until they are required for firing. This will cause but\r\nlittle delay in an action, and will conduce much to security from\r\naccidents.\r\n\r\nWhen loaded fire-arms have been exposed for any considerable time to a\r\nmoist atmosphere, they should be discharged, or the cartridges drawn,\r\nand the arms thoroughly cleaned, dried, and oiled. Too much attention\r\ncan not be given in keeping arms in perfect firing order.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAILING.\r\n\r\nI know of nothing in the woodman's education of so much importance, or\r\nso difficult to acquire, as the art of trailing or tracking men and\r\nanimals. To become an adept in this art requires the constant practice\r\nof years, and with some men a lifetime does not suffice to learn it.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the Indians whom I have met with are proficient in this\r\nspecies of knowledge, the faculty for acquiring which appears to be\r\ninnate with them. Exigencies of woodland and prairie-life stimulate the\r\nsavage from childhood to develop faculties so important in the arts of\r\nwar and of the chase.\r\n\r\nI have seen very few white men who were good trailers, and practice did\r\nnot seem very materially to improve their faculties in this regard;\r\nthey have not the same acute perceptions for these things as the Indian\r\nor the Mexican. It is not apprehended that this difficult branch of\r\nwoodcraft can be taught from books, as it pertains almost exclusively\r\nto the school of practice, yet I will give some facts relating to the\r\nhabits of the Indians that will facilitate its acquirement.\r\n\r\nA party of Indians, for example, starting out upon a war excursion,\r\nleave their families behind, and never transport their lodges; whereas,\r\nwhen they move with their families, they carry their lodges and other\r\neffects. If, therefore, an Indian trail is discovered with the marks of\r\nthe lodge-poles upon it, it has certainly not been made by a war-party;\r\nbut if the track do not show the trace of lodge-poles, it will be\r\nequally certain that a war or hunting party has passed that way, and if\r\nit is not desired to come in conflict with them, their direction may be\r\navoided. Mustangs or wild horses, when moving from place to place,\r\nleave a trail which is sometimes difficult to distinguish from that\r\nmade by a mounted party of Indians, especially if the mustangs do not\r\nstop to graze. This may be determined by following upon the trail until\r\nsome dung is found, and if this should lie in a single pile, it is a\r\nsure indication that a herd of mustangs has passed, as they always stop\r\nto relieve themselves, while a party of Indians would keep their horses\r\nin motion, and the ordure would be scattered along the road. If the\r\ntrail pass through woodland, the mustangs will occasionally go under\r\nthe limbs of trees too low to admit the passage of a man on horseback.\r\n\r\nAn Indian, on coming to a trail, will generally tell at a glance its\r\nage, by what particular tribe it was made, the number of the party, and\r\nmany other things connected with it astounding to the uninitiated.\r\n\r\nI remember, upon one occasion, as I was riding with a Delaware upon the\r\nprairies, we crossed the trail of a large party of Indians traveling\r\nwith lodges. The tracks appeared to me quite fresh, and I remarked to\r\nthe Indian that we must be near the party. \"Oh no,\" said he, \"the trail\r\nwas made two days before, in the morning,\" at the same time pointing\r\nwith his finger to where the sun would be at about 8 o'clock. Then,\r\nseeing that my curiosity was excited to know by what means he arrived\r\nat this conclusion, he called my attention to the fact that there had\r\nbeen no dew for the last two nights, but that on the previous morning\r\nit had been heavy. He then pointed out to me some spears of grass that\r\nhad been pressed down into the earth by the horses' hoofs, upon which\r\nthe sand still adhered, having dried on, thus clearly showing that the\r\ngrass was wet when the tracks were made.\r\n\r\nAt another time, as I was traveling with the same Indian, I discovered\r\nupon the ground what I took to be a bear-track, with a distinctly-marked\r\nimpression of the heel and all the toes. I immediately called the\r\nIndian's attention to it, at the same time flattering myself that I had\r\nmade quite an important discovery, which had escaped his observation.\r\nThe fellow remarked with a smile, \"Oh no, captain, may be so he not\r\nbear-track.\" He then pointed with his gun-rod to some spears of grass\r\nthat grew near the impression, but I did not comprehend the mystery\r\nuntil he dismounted and explained to me that, when the wind was\r\nblowing, the spears of grass would be bent over toward the ground, and\r\nthe oscillating motion thereby produced would scoop out the loose sand\r\ninto the shape I have described. The truth of this explanation was\r\napparent, yet it occurred to me that its solution would have baffled\r\nthe wits of most white men.\r\n\r\nFresh tracks generally show moisture where the earth has been turned\r\nup, but after a short exposure to the sun they become dry. If the\r\ntracks be very recent, the sand may sometimes, where it is very loose\r\nand dry, be seen running back into the tracks, and by following them to\r\na place where they cross water, the earth will be wet for some distance\r\nafter they leave it. The droppings of the dung from animals are also\r\ngood indications of the age of a trail. It is well to remember whether\r\nthere have been any rains within a few days, as the age of a trail may\r\nsometimes be conjectured in this way. It is very easy to tell whether\r\ntracks have been made before or after a rain, as the water washes off\r\nall the sharp edges.\r\n\r\nIt is not a difficult matter to distinguish the tracks of American\r\nhorses from those of Indian horses, as the latter are never shod;\r\nmoreover, they are much smaller.\r\n\r\nIn trailing horses, there will be no trouble while the ground is soft,\r\nas the impressions they leave will then be deep and distinct; but when\r\nthey pass over hard or rocky ground, it is sometimes a very slow and\r\ntroublesome process to follow them. Where there is grass, the trace can\r\nbe seen for a considerable time, as the grass will be trodden down and\r\nbent in the direction the party has moved; should the grass have\r\nreturned to its upright position, the trail can often be distinguished\r\nby standing upon it and looking ahead for some distance in the\r\ndirection it has been pursuing; the grass that has been turned over\r\nwill show a different shade of green from that around it, and this\r\noften marks a trail for a long time.\r\n\r\nShould all traces of the track be obliterated in certain localities, it\r\nis customary with the Indians to follow on in the direction it has been\r\npursuing for a time, and it is quite probable that in some place where\r\nthe ground is more favorable it will show itself again. Should the\r\ntrail not be recovered in this way, they search for a place where the\r\nearth is soft, and make a careful examination, embracing the entire\r\narea where it is likely to run.\r\n\r\nIndians who find themselves pursued and wish to escape, scatter as much\r\nas possible, with an understanding that they are to meet again at some\r\npoint in advance, so that, if the pursuing party follows any one of the\r\ntracks, it will invariably lead to the place of rendezvous. If, for\r\nexample, the trail points in the direction of a mountain pass, or\r\ntoward any other place which affords the only passage through a\r\nparticular section of country, it would not be worth while to spend\r\nmuch time in hunting it, as it would probably be regained at the pass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORSE-TRACKS AT ORDINARY SPEED.]\r\n\r\nAs it is important in trailing Indians to know at what gaits they are\r\ntraveling, and as the appearance of the tracks of horses are not\r\nfamiliar to all, I have in the following cut represented the prints\r\nmade by the hoofs at the ordinary speed of the walk, trot, and gallop,\r\nso that persons, in following the trail of Indians, may form an idea as\r\nto the probability of overtaking them, and regulate their movements\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nIn traversing a district of unknown country where there are no\r\nprominent landmarks, and with the view of returning to the point of\r\ndeparture, a pocket compass should always be carried, and attached by a\r\nstring to a button-hole of the coat, to prevent its being lost or\r\nmislaid; and on starting out, as well as frequently during the trip, to\r\ntake the bearing, and examine the appearance of the country when facing\r\ntoward the starting-point, as a landscape presents a very different\r\naspect when viewing it from opposite directions. There are few white\r\nmen who can retrace their steps for any great distance unless they take\r\nthe above precautions in passing over an unknown country for the first\r\ntime; but with the Indians it is different; the sense of locality seems\r\nto be innate with them, and they do not require the aid of the magnetic\r\nneedle to guide them.\r\n\r\nUpon a certain occasion, when I had made a long march over an\r\nunexplored section, and was returning upon an entirely different route\r\nwithout either road or trail, a Delaware, by the name of \"Black\r\nBeaver,\" who was in my party, on arriving at a particular point,\r\nsuddenly halted, and, turning to me, asked if I recognized the country\r\nbefore us. Seeing no familiar objects, I replied in the negative. He\r\nput the same question to the other white men of the party, all of whom\r\ngave the same answers, whereupon he smiled, and in his quaint\r\nvernacular said, \"Injun he don't know nothing. Injun big fool. White\r\nman mighty smart; he know heap.\" At the same time he pointed to a tree\r\nabout two hundred yards from where we were then standing, and informed\r\nus that our outward trail ran directly by the side of it, which proved\r\nto be true.\r\n\r\nAnother time, as I was returning from the Comanche country over a route\r\nmany miles distant from the one I had traveled in going out, one of my\r\nDelaware hunters, who had never visited the section before, on arriving\r\nupon the crest of an eminence in the prairie, pointed out to me a clump\r\nof trees in the distance, remarking that our outward track would be\r\nfound there. I was not, however, disposed to credit his statement until\r\nwe reached the locality and found the road passing the identical spot\r\nhe had indicated.\r\n\r\nThis same Indian would start from any place to which he had gone by a\r\nsinuous route, through an unknown country, and keep a direct bearing\r\nback to the place of departure; and he assured me that he has never,\r\neven during the most cloudy or foggy weather, or in the darkest nights,\r\nlost the points of compass. There are very few white men who are\r\nendowed with these wonderful faculties, and those few are only rendered\r\nproficient by matured experience.\r\n\r\nI have known several men, after they had become lost in the prairies,\r\nto wander about for days without exercising the least judgment, and\r\nfinally exhibiting a state of mental aberration almost upon the verge\r\nof lunacy. Instead of reasoning upon their situation, they exhaust\r\nthemselves running a-head at their utmost speed without any regard to\r\ndirection. When a person is satisfied that he has lost his way, he\r\nshould stop and reflect upon the course he has been traveling, the time\r\nthat has elapsed since he left his camp, and the probable distance that\r\nhe is from it; and if he is unable to retrace his steps, he should keep\r\nas nearly in the direction of them as possible; and if he has a\r\ncompass, this will be an easy matter; but, above all, he should guard\r\nagainst following his own track around in a circle with the idea that\r\nhe is in a beaten trace.\r\n\r\nWhen he is traveling with a train of wagons which leaves a plain trail,\r\nhe can make the distance he has traveled from camp the radius of a\r\ncircle in which to ride around, and before the circle is described he\r\nwill strike the trail. If the person has no compass, it is always well\r\nto make an observation, and to remember the direction of the wind at\r\nthe time of departure from camp; and as this would not generally change\r\nduring the day, it would afford a means of keeping the points of the\r\ncompass.\r\n\r\nIn the night Ursa Major (the Great Bear) is not only useful to find the\r\nnorth star, but its position, when the pointers will be vertical in the\r\nheavens, may be estimated with sufficient accuracy to determine the\r\nnorth even when the north star can not be seen. In tropical latitudes,\r\nthe zodiacal stars, such as Orion and Antares, give the east and west\r\nbearing, and the Southern Cross the north and south when Polaris and\r\nthe Great Bear can not be seen.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the moss upon the firs and other trees in Europe gives\r\na certain indication of the points of compass in a forest country, the\r\ngreatest amount accumulating upon the north side of the trees. But I\r\nhave often observed the trees in our own forests, and have not been\r\nable to form any positive conclusions in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nGuides and Hunters.

They have been with me upon several different\r\noccasions, and I have invariably found them intelligent, brave,\r\nreliable, and in every respect well qualified to fill their positions.\r\nThey are endowed with those keen and wonderful powers in woodcraft\r\nwhich can only be acquired by instinct, practice, and necessity, and\r\nwhich are possessed by no other people that I have heard of, unless it\r\nbe the khebirs or guides who escort the caravans across the great\r\ndesert of Sahara.\r\n\r\nGeneral E. Dumas, in his treatise upon the \"Great Desert,\" published in\r\nParis, 1856, in speaking of these guides, says:\r\n\r\n\"The khebir is always a man of intelligence, of tried probity, bravery,\r\nand skill. He knows how to determine his position from the appearance\r\nof the stars; by the experience of other journeys he has learned all\r\nabout the roads, wells, and pastures; the dangers of certain passes,\r\nand the means of avoiding them; all the chiefs whose territories it is\r\nnecessary to pass through; the salubrity of the different localities;\r\nthe remedies against diseases; the treatment of fractures, and the\r\nantidotes to the venom of snakes and scorpions.\r\n\r\n\"In these vast solitudes, where nothing seems to indicate the route,\r\nwhere the wind covers up all traces of the track with sand, the khebir\r\nhas a thousand ways of directing himself in the right course. In the\r\nnight, when there are no stars in sight, by the simple inspection of a\r\nhandful of grass, which he examines with his fingers, which he smells\r\nand tastes, he informs himself of his locale without ever being lost or\r\nwandering.\r\n\r\n\"I saw with astonishment that our conductor, although he had but one\r\neye, and that defective, recognized perfectly the route; and Leon, the\r\nAfrican, states that the conductor of his caravan became blind upon the\r\njourney from ophthalmia, yet by feeling the grass and sand he could\r\ntell when we were approaching an inhabited place.\r\n\r\n\"Our guide had all the qualities which make a good khebir. He was\r\nyoung, large, and strong; he was a master of arms; his eye commanded\r\nrespect, and his speech won the heart. But if in the tent he was\r\naffable and winning, once _en route_ he spoke only when it was\r\nnecessary, and never smiled.\"\r\n\r\nThe Delawares are but a minute remnant of the great Algonquin family,\r\nwhose early traditions declare them to be the parent stock from which\r\nthe other numerous branches of the Algonquin tribes originated. And\r\nthey are the same people whom the first white settlers found so\r\nnumerous upon the banks of the Delaware.\r\n\r\nWhen William Penn held his council with the Delawares upon the ground\r\nwhere the city of Philadelphia now stands, they were as peaceful and\r\nunwarlike in their habits as the Quakers themselves. They had been\r\nsubjugated by the Five Nations, forced to take the appellation of\r\nsquaws, and forego the use of arms; but after they moved west, beyond\r\nthe influence of their former masters, their naturally independent\r\nspirit revived, they soon regained their lofty position as braves and\r\nwarriors, and the male squaws of the Iroquois soon became formidable\r\nmen and heroes, and so have continued to the present day. Their\r\nwar-path has reached the shores of the Pacific Ocean on the west,\r\nHudson's Bay on the north, and into the very heart of Mexico on the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nThey are not clannish in their dispositions like most other Indians,\r\nnor by their habits confined to any given locality, but are found as\r\ntraders, trappers, or hunters among most of the Indian tribes\r\ninhabiting our continent. I even saw them living with the Mormons in\r\nUtah. They are among the Indians as the Jews among the whites,\r\nessentially wanderers.\r\n\r\nThe Shawnees have been associated with the Delawares 185 years. They\r\nintermarry and live as one people. Their present places of abode are\r\nupon the Missouri River, near Fort Leavenworth, and in the Choctaw\r\nTerritory, upon the Canadian River, near Fort Arbuckle. They are\r\nfamiliar with many of the habits and customs of their pale-faced\r\nneighbors, and some of them speak the English language, yet many of\r\ntheir native characteristics tenaciously cling to them.\r\n\r\nUpon one occasion I endeavored to teach a Delaware the use of the\r\ncompass. He seemed much interested in its mechanism, and very\r\nattentively observed the oscillations of the needle. He would move away\r\na short distance, then return, keeping his eyes continually fixed upon\r\nthe needle and the uniform position into which it settled. He did not,\r\nhowever, seem to comprehend it in the least, but regarded the entire\r\nproceeding as a species of necromantic performance got up for his\r\nespecial benefit, and I was about putting away the instrument when he\r\nmotioned me to stop, and came walking toward it with a very serious but\r\nincredulous countenance, remarking, as he pointed his finger toward it,\r\n\"Maybe so he tell lie sometime.\"\r\n\r\nThe ignorance evinced by this Indian regarding the uses of the compass\r\nis less remarkable than that of some white men who are occasionally met\r\nupon the frontier.\r\n\r\nWhile surveying Indian lands in the wilds of Western Texas during the\r\nsummer of 1854, I encountered a deputy surveyor traveling on foot, with\r\nhis compass and chain upon his back. I saluted him very politely,\r\nremarking that I presumed he was a surveyor, to which he replied, \"I\r\nreckon, _stranger_, I ar that thar individoal.\"\r\n\r\nI had taken the magnetic variation several times, always with nearly\r\nthe same results (about 10 deg. 20'); but, in order to verify my\r\nobservations, I was curious to learn how they accorded with his own\r\nworking, and accordingly inquired of him what he made the variation of\r\nthe compass in that particular locality. He seemed struck with\r\nastonishment, took his compass from his back and laid it upon a log\r\nnear by, then facing me, and pointing with his hand toward it, said,\r\n\r\n\"Straanger, do yer see that thar instru-_ment_?\" to which I replied in\r\nthe affirmative. He continued,\r\n\r\n\"I've owned her well-nigh goin on twenty year. I've put her through the\r\nperarries and through the timber, and now look yeer, straanger, you can\r\njust bet your life on't she never _var_-ried arry time, and if you'll\r\njust follow her sign you'll knock the centre outer the north star. She\r\nnever lies, she don't.\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed to consider my interrogatory as a direct insinuation that his\r\ncompass was an imperfect one, and hence his indignation. Thinking that\r\nI should not get any very important intelligence concerning the\r\nvariation of the needle from this surveyor, I begged his pardon for\r\nquestioning the accuracy of his instru-_ment_, bid him good-morning,\r\nand continued on my journey.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK BEAVER.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 I met with a very interesting specimen of the Delaware tribe\r\nwhose name was Black Beaver. He had for ten years been in the employ of\r\nthe American Fur Company, and during this time had visited nearly every\r\npoint of interest within the limits of our unsettled territory. He had\r\nset his traps and spread his blanket upon the head waters of the\r\nMissouri and Columbia; and his wanderings had led him south to the\r\nColorado and Gila, and thence to the shores of the Pacific in Southern\r\nCalifornia. His life had been that of a veritable cosmopolite, filled\r\nwith scenes of intense and startling interest, bold and reckless\r\nadventure. He was with me two seasons in the capacity of guide, and I\r\nalways found him perfectly reliable, brave, and competent. His\r\nreputation as a resolute, determined, and fearless warrior did not\r\nadmit of question, yet I have never seen a man who wore his laurels\r\nwith less vanity.\r\n\r\nWhen I first made his acquaintance I was puzzled to know what to think\r\nof him. He would often, in speaking of the Prairie Indians, say to me,\r\n\r\n\"Captain, if you have a fight, you mustn't count much on me, for I'ze a\r\nbig coward. When the fight begins I 'spect you'll see me run under the\r\ncannon; Injun mighty 'fraid of big gun.\"\r\n\r\nI expressed my surprise that he should, if what he told me was true,\r\nhave gained such a reputation as a warrior; whereupon he informed me\r\nthat many years previous, when he was a young man, and before he had\r\never been in battle, he, with about twenty white men and four\r\nDelawares, were at one of the Fur Company's trading-posts upon the\r\nUpper Missouri, engaged in trapping beaver. While there, the stockade\r\nfort was attacked by a numerous band of Blackfeet Indians, who fought\r\nbravely, and seemed determined to annihilate the little band that\r\ndefended it.\r\n\r\nAfter the investment had been completed, and there appeared no\r\nprobability of the attacking party's abandoning their purpose, \"One\r\nd----d fool Delaware\" (as Black Beaver expressed it) proposed to his\r\ncountrymen to make a sortie, and thereby endeavor to effect an\r\nimpression upon the Blackfeet. This, Beaver said, was the last thing he\r\nwould ever have thought of suggesting, and it startled him\r\nprodigiously, causing him to tremble so much that it was with\r\ndifficulty he could stand.\r\n\r\nHe had, however, started from home with the fixed purpose of becoming a\r\ndistinguished brave, and made a great effort to stifle his emotion. He\r\nassumed an air of determination, saying that was the very idea he was\r\njust about to propose; and, slapping his comrades upon the back,\r\nstarted toward the gate, telling them to follow. As soon as the gate\r\nwas passed, he says, he took particular care to keep in the rear of the\r\nothers, so that, in the event of a retreat, he would be able to reach\r\nthe stockade first.\r\n\r\nThey had not proceeded far before a perfect shower of arrows came\r\nfalling around them on all sides, but, fortunately, without doing them\r\nharm. Not fancying this hot reception, those in front proposed an\r\nimmediate retreat, to which he most gladly acceded, and at once set off\r\nat his utmost speed, expecting to reach the fort first. But he soon\r\ndiscovered that his comrades were more fleet, and were rapidly passing\r\nand leaving him behind. Suddenly he stopped and called out to them,\r\n\"Come back here, you cowards, you squaws; what for you run away and\r\nleave brave man to fight alone?\" This taunting appeal to their courage\r\nturned them back, and, with their united efforts, they succeeded in\r\nbeating off the enemy immediately around them, securing their entrance\r\ninto the fort.\r\n\r\nBeaver says when the gate was closed the captain in charge of the\r\nestablishment grasped him warmly by the hand, saying, \"Black Beaver,\r\nyou are a brave man; you have done this day what no other man in the\r\nfort would have the courage to do, and I thank you from the bottom of\r\nmy heart.\"\r\n\r\nIn relating the circumstance to me he laughed most heartily, thinking\r\nit a very good joke, and said after that he was regarded as a brave\r\nwarrior.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, my friend Beaver was one of those few heroes who never\r\nsounded his own trumpet; yet no one that knows him ever presumed to\r\nquestion his courage.\r\n\r\nAt another time, while Black Beaver remained upon the head waters of\r\nthe Missouri, he was left in charge of a \"_cache_\" consisting of a\r\nquantity of goods buried to prevent their being stolen by the Indians.\r\nDuring the time he was engaged upon this duty he amused himself by\r\nhunting in the vicinity, only visiting his charge once a day. As he was\r\nmaking one of these periodical visits, and had arrived upon the summit\r\nof a hill overlooking the locality, he suddenly discovered a large\r\nnumber of hostile Blackfeet occupying it, and he supposed they had\r\nappropriated all the goods. As soon as they espied him, they beckoned\r\nfor him to come down and have a friendly chat with them.\r\n\r\nKnowing that their purpose was to beguile him into their power, he\r\nreplied that he did not feel in a talking humor just at that time, and\r\nstarted off in another direction, whereupon they hallooed after him,\r\nmaking use of the most insulting language and gestures, and asking him\r\nif he considered himself a man thus to run away from his friends, and\r\nintimating that, in their opinion, he was an old woman, who had better\r\ngo home and take care of the children.\r\n\r\nBeaver says this roused his indignation to such a pitch that he\r\nstopped, turned around, and replied, \"Maybe so; s'pose three or four of\r\nyou Injuns come up here alone, I'll show you if I'ze old womans.\" They\r\ndid not, however, accept the challenge, and Beaver rode off.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Delawares generally seem quite happy in their social\r\nrelations, yet they are not altogether exempt from some of those minor\r\ndiscords which occasionally creep in and mar the domestic harmony of\r\ntheir more civilized pale-faced brethren.\r\n\r\nI remember, upon one occasion, I had bivouacked for the night with\r\nBlack Beaver, and he had been endeavoring to while away the long hours\r\nof the evening by relating to me some of the most thrilling incidents\r\nof his highly-adventurous and erratic life, when at length a hiatus in\r\nthe conversation gave me an opportunity of asking him if he was a\r\nmarried man. He hesitated for some time; then looking up and giving his\r\nforefinger a twirl, to imitate the throwing of a lasso, replied, \"One\r\ntime me catch 'um wife. I pay that woman, _his modder_, one hoss--one\r\nsaddle--one bridle--two plug tobacco, and plenty goods. I take him home\r\nto my house--got plenty meat--plenty corn--plenty every thing. One time\r\nme go take walk, maybe so three, maybe so two hours. When I come home,\r\nthat woman he say, 'Black Beaver, what for you go way long time?' I\r\nsay, 'I not go nowhere; I just take one littel walk.' Then that woman\r\nhe get heap mad, and say, 'No, Black Beaver, you not take no littel\r\nwalk. I know what for you go way; _you go see nodder one woman_.' I\r\nsay, 'Maybe not.' Then that woman she cry long time, and all e'time now\r\nshe mad. You never seen 'Merican woman that a-way?\"\r\n\r\nI sympathized most deeply with my friend in his distress, and told him\r\nfor his consolation that, in my opinion, the women of his nation were\r\nnot peculiar in this respect; that they were pretty much alike all\r\nover the world, and I was under the impression that there were\r\nwell-authenticated instances even among white women where they had\r\nsubjected themselves to the same causes of complaint so feelingly\r\ndepicted by him. Whereupon he very earnestly asked, \"What you do for\r\ncure him? Whip him?\" I replied, \"No; that, so far as my observation\r\nextended, I was under the impression that this was generally regarded\r\nby those who had suffered from its effects as one of those chronic and\r\nvexatious complaints which would not be benefited by the treatment he\r\nsuggested, even when administered in homoeopathic doses, and I believed\r\nit was now admitted by all sensible men that it was better in all such\r\ncases to let nature take its course, trusting to a merciful\r\nProvidence.\"\r\n\r\nAt this reply his countenance assumed a dejected expression, but at\r\nlength he brightened up again and triumphantly remarked, \"I tell you,\r\nmy friend, what I do; I ketch 'um nodder one wife when I go home.\"\r\n\r\nBlack Beaver had visited St. Louis and the small towns upon the\r\nMissouri frontier, and he prided himself not a little upon his\r\nacquaintance with the customs of the whites, and never seemed more\r\nhappy than when an opportunity offered to display this knowledge in\r\npresence of his Indian companions. It so happened, upon one occasion,\r\nthat I had a Comanche guide who bivouacked at the same fire with\r\nBeaver. On visiting them one evening according to my usual practice, I\r\nfound them engaged in a very earnest and apparently not very amicable\r\nconversation. On inquiring the cause of this, Beaver answered,\r\n\r\n\"I've been telling this Comanche what I seen 'mong the white folks.\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"Well, Beaver, what did you tell him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell him 'bout the steam-boats, and the railroads, and the heap o'\r\nhouses I seen in St. Louis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, what does he think of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"He say I'ze d----d fool.\"\r\n\r\n\"What else did you tell him about?\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell him the world is round, but he keep all e'time say, Hush, you\r\nfool! do you spose I'ze child? Haven't I got eyes? Can't I see the\r\nprairie? You call him round? He say, too, maybe so I tell you something\r\nyou not know before. One time my grandfather he make long journey that\r\nway (pointing to the west). When he get on big mountain, he seen heap\r\nwater on t'other side, jest so flat he can be, and he seen the sun go\r\nright straight down on t'other side. I then tell him all these rivers\r\nhe seen, all e'time the water he run; s'pose the world flat the water\r\nhe stand still. Maybe so he not b'lieve me?\"\r\n\r\nI told him it certainly looked very much like it. I then asked him to\r\nexplain to the Comanche the magnetic telegraph. He looked at me\r\nearnestly, and said,\r\n\r\n\"What you call that magnetic telegraph?\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"you have heard of New York and New Orleans?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Very well; we have a wire connecting these two cities, which are about\r\na thousand miles apart, and it would take a man thirty days to ride it\r\nupon a good horse. Now a man stands at one end of this wire in New\r\nYork, and by touching it a few times he inquires of his friend in New\r\nOrleans what he had for breakfast. His friend in New Orleans touches\r\nthe other end of the wire, and in ten minutes the answer comes\r\nback--ham and eggs. Tell him that, Beaver.\"\r\n\r\nHis countenance assumed a most comical expression, but he made no\r\nremark until I again requested him to repeat what I had said to the\r\nComanche, when he observed,\r\n\r\n\"No, captain, I not tell him that, for I don't b'lieve that myself.\"\r\n\r\nUpon my assuring him that such was the fact, and that I had seen it\r\nmyself, he said,\r\n\r\n\"Injun not very smart; sometimes he's big fool, but he holler pretty\r\nloud; you hear him maybe half a mile; you say 'Merican man he talk\r\nthousand miles. I 'spect you try to fool me now, captain; _maybe so\r\nyou lie_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians living between the outer white settlements and the nomadic\r\ntribes of the Plains form intermediate social links in the chain of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThe first of these occupy permanent habitations, but the others,\r\nalthough they cultivate the soil, are only resident while their crops\r\nare growing, going out into the prairies after harvest to spend the\r\nwinter in hunting. Among the former may be mentioned the Cherokees,\r\nCreeks, Choctaws, and Chickasaws, and of the latter are the Delawares,\r\nShawnees, Kickapoos, etc., who are perfectly familiar with the use of\r\nthe rifle, and, in my judgment, would make as formidable partisan\r\nwarriors as can be found in the universe.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WILD TRIBES OF THE WEST.\r\n\r\nThese are very different in their habits from the natives that formerly\r\noccupied the country bordering upon the Atlantic coast. The latter\r\nlived permanently in villages, where they cultivated the soil, and\r\nnever wandered very far from them. They did not use horses, but always\r\nmade their war expeditions on foot, and never came into action unless\r\nthey could screen themselves behind the cover of trees. They inflicted\r\nthe most inhuman tortures upon their prisoners, but did not, that I am\r\naware, violate the chastity of women.\r\n\r\nThe prairie tribes have no permanent abiding places; they never plant a\r\nseed, but roam for hundreds of miles in every direction over the\r\nPlains. They are perfect horsemen, and seldom go to war on foot. Their\r\nattacks are made in the open prairies, and when unhorsed they are\r\npowerless. They do not, like the eastern Indians, inflict upon their\r\nprisoners prolonged tortures, but invariably subject all females that\r\nhave the misfortune to fall into their merciless clutches to an ordeal\r\nworse than death.\r\n\r\nIt is highly important to every man passing through a country\r\nfrequented by Indians to know some of their habits, customs, and\r\npropensities, as this will facilitate his intercourse with friendly\r\ntribes, and enable him, when he wishes to avoid a conflict, to take\r\nprecautions against coming in collision with those who are hostile.\r\n\r\nAlmost every tribe has its own way of constructing its lodges,\r\nencamping, making fires, its own style of dress, by some of which\r\npeculiarities the experienced frontiersman can generally distinguish\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe Osages, for example, make their lodges in the shape of a wagon-top,\r\nof bent rods or willows covered with skins, blankets, or the bark of\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThe Kickapoo lodges are made in an oval form, something like a rounded\r\nhay-stack, of poles set in the ground, bent over, and united at top;\r\nthis is covered with cloths or bark.\r\n\r\nThe Witchetaws, Wacos, Towackanies, and Tonkowas erect their hunting\r\nlodges of sticks put up in the form of the frustum of a cone and\r\ncovered with brush.\r\n\r\nAll these tribes leave the frame-work of their lodges standing when\r\nthey move from camp to camp, and this, of course, indicates the\r\nparticular tribe that erected them.\r\n\r\nThe Delawares and Shawnees plant two upright forked poles, place a\r\nstick across them, and stretch a canvas covering over it, in the same\r\nmanner as with the \"_tente d'abri_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sioux, Arapahoes, Cheyennes, Utes, Snakes, Blackfeet, and Kioways\r\nmake use of the Comanche lodge, covered with dressed buffalo hides.\r\n\r\nAll the Prairie Indians I have met with are the most inveterate\r\nbeggars. They will flock around strangers, and, in the most importunate\r\nmanner, ask for every thing they see, especially tobacco and sugar;\r\nand, if allowed, they will handle, examine, and occasionally pilfer\r\nsuch things as happen to take their fancy. The proper way to treat them\r\nis to give them at once such articles as are to be disposed of, and\r\nthen, in a firm and decided manner, let them understand that they are\r\nto receive nothing else.\r\n\r\nA party of Keechis once visited my camp with their principal chief, who\r\nsaid he had some important business to discuss, and demanded a council\r\nwith the _capitan_. After consent had been given, he assembled his\r\nprincipal men, and, going through the usual preliminary of taking a\r\n_big smoke_, he arose, and with a great deal of ceremony commenced\r\nhis pompous and flowery speech, which, like all others of a similar\r\ncharacter, amounted to nothing, until he touched upon the real object\r\nof his visit. He said he had traveled a long distance over the prairies\r\nto see and have a talk with his white brothers; that his people were\r\nvery hungry and naked. He then approached me with six small sticks,\r\nand, after shaking hands, laid one of the sticks in my hand, which he\r\nsaid represented sugar, another signified tobacco, and the other four,\r\npork, flour, whisky, and blankets, all of which he assured me his\r\npeople were in great need of, and must have. His talk was then\r\nconcluded, and he sat down, apparently much gratified with the graceful\r\nand impressive manner with which he had executed his part of the\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nIt then devolved upon me to respond to the brilliant effort of the\r\nprairie orator, which I did in something like the following manner.\r\nAfter imitating his style for a short time, I closed my remarks by\r\ntelling him that we were poor infantry soldiers, who were always\r\nobliged to go on foot; that we had become very tired of walking, and\r\nwould like very much to ride. Furthermore, I had observed that they had\r\namong them many fine horses and mules. I then took two small sticks,\r\nand imitating as nearly as possible the manner of the chief, placed one\r\nin his hand, which I told him was nothing more or less than a\r\nfirst-rate horse, and then the other, which signified a good large\r\nmule. I closed by saying that I was ready to exchange presents whenever\r\nit suited his convenience.\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other for some time without speaking, but finally\r\ngot up and walked away, and I was not troubled with them again.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN FIGHTING.\r\n\r\nThe military system, as taught and practiced in our army up to the time\r\nof the Mexican war, was, without doubt, efficient and well adapted to\r\nthe art of war among civilized nations. This system was designed for\r\nthe operations of armies acting in populated districts, furnishing\r\nample resources, and against an enemy who was tangible, and made use of\r\na similar system.\r\n\r\nThe vast expanse of desert territory that has been annexed to our\r\ndomain within the last few years is peopled by numerous tribes of\r\nmarauding and erratic savages, who are mounted upon fleet and hardy\r\nhorses, making war the business and pastime of their lives, and\r\nacknowledging none of the ameliorating conventionalities of civilized\r\nwarfare. Their tactics are such as to render the old system almost\r\nwholly impotent.\r\n\r\nTo act against an enemy who is here to-day and there to-morrow; who at\r\none time stampedes a herd of mules upon the head waters of the\r\nArkansas, and when next heard from is in the very heart of the\r\npopulated districts of Mexico, laying waste haciendas, and carrying\r\ndevastation, rapine, and murder in his steps; who is every where\r\nwithout being any where; who assembles at the moment of combat, and\r\nvanishes whenever fortune turns against him; who leaves his women and\r\nchildren far distant from the theatre of hostilities, and has neither\r\ntowns or magazines to defend, nor lines of retreat to cover; who\r\nderives his commissariat from the country he operates in, and is not\r\nencumbered with baggage-wagons or pack-trains; who comes into action\r\nonly when it suits his purposes, and never without the advantage of\r\nnumbers or position--with such an enemy the strategic science of\r\ncivilized nations loses much of its importance, and finds but rarely,\r\nand only in peculiar localities, an opportunity to be put in practice.\r\n\r\nOur little army, scattered as it has been over the vast area of our\r\npossessions, in small garrisons of one or two companies each, has\r\nseldom been in a situation to act successfully on the offensive against\r\nlarge numbers of these marauders, and has often been condemned to hold\r\nitself almost exclusively upon the defensive. The morale of the troops\r\nmust thereby necessarily be seriously impaired, and the confidence of\r\nthe savages correspondingly augmented. The system of small garrisons\r\nhas a tendency to disorganize the troops in proportion as they are\r\nscattered, and renders them correspondingly inefficient. The same\r\nresults have been observed by the French army in Algeria, where, in\r\n1845, their troops were, like ours, disseminated over a vast space, and\r\nbroken up into small detachments stationed in numerous intrenched\r\nposts. Upon the sudden appearance of Abd el Kader in the plain of\r\nMitidja, they were defeated with serious losses, and were from day to\r\nday obliged to abandon these useless stations, with all the supplies\r\nthey contained. A French writer, in discussing this subject, says:\r\n\r\n\"We have now abandoned the fatal idea of defending Algeria by small\r\nintrenched posts. In studying the character of the war, the nature of\r\nthe men who are to oppose us, and of the country in which we are to\r\noperate, we must be convinced of the danger of admitting any other\r\nsystem of fortification than that which is to receive our grand depots,\r\nour magazines, and to serve as places to recruit and rest our troops\r\nwhen exhausted by long expeditionary movements.\r\n\r\n\"These fortifications should be established in the midst of the centres\r\nof action, so as to command the principal routes, and serve as pivots\r\nto expeditionary columns.\r\n\r\n\"We owe our success to a system of war which has its proofs in twice\r\nchanging our relations with the Arabs. This system consists altogether\r\nin the great mobility we have given to our troops. Instead of\r\ndisseminating our soldiers with the vain hope of protecting our\r\nfrontiers with a line of small posts, we have concentrated them, to\r\nhave them at all times ready for emergencies, and since then the\r\nfortune of the Arabs has waned, and we have marched from victory to\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\n\"This system, which has thus far succeeded, ought to succeed always,\r\nand to conduct us, God willing, to the peaceful possession of the\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nIn reading a treatise upon war as it is practiced by the French in\r\nAlgeria, by Colonel A. Laure, of the 2d Algerine Tirailleurs, published\r\nin Paris in 1858, I was struck with the remarkable similarity between\r\nthe habits of the Arabs and those of the wandering tribes that inhabit\r\nour Western prairies. Their manner of making war is almost precisely\r\nthe same, and a successful system of strategic operations for one will,\r\nin my opinion, apply to the other.\r\n\r\nAs the Turks have been more successful than the French in their\r\nmilitary operations against the Arab tribes, it may not be altogether\r\nuninteresting to inquire by what means these inferior soldiers have\r\naccomplished the best results.\r\n\r\nThe author above mentioned, in speaking upon this subject, says:\r\n\r\n\"In these latter days the world is occupied with the organization of\r\nmounted infantry, according to the example of the Turks, where, in the\r\nmost successful experiments that have been made, the mule carries the\r\nfoot-soldier.\r\n\r\n\"The Turkish soldier mounts his mule, puts his provisions upon one side\r\nand his accoutrements upon the other, and, thus equipped, sets out upon\r\nlong marches, traveling day and night, and only reposing occasionally\r\nin bivouac. Arrived near the place of operations (as near the break of\r\nday as possible), the Turks dismount in the most profound silence, and\r\npass in succession the bridle of one mule through that of another in\r\nsuch a manner that a single man is sufficient to hold forty or fifty of\r\nthem by retaining the last bridle, which secures all the others; they\r\nthen examine their arms, and are ready to commence their work. The\r\nchief gives his last orders, posts his guides, and they make the\r\nattack, surprise the enemy, generally asleep, and carry the position\r\nwithout resistance. The operation terminated, they hasten to beat a\r\nretreat, to prevent the neighboring tribes from assembling, and thus\r\navoid a combat.\r\n\r\n\"The Turks had only three thousand mounted men and ten thousand\r\ninfantry in Algeria, yet these thirteen thousand men sufficed to\r\nconquer the same obstacles which have arrested us for twenty-six years,\r\nnotwithstanding the advantage we had of an army which was successively\r\nre-enforced until it amounted to a hundred thousand.\r\n\r\n\"Why not imitate the Turks, then, mount our infantry upon mules, and\r\nreduce the strength of our army?\r\n\r\n\"The response is very simple:\r\n\r\n\"The Turks are Turks--that is to say, Mussulmans--and indigenous to the\r\ncountry; the Turks speak the Arabic language; the Deys of Algiers had\r\nless country to guard than we, and they care very little about\r\nretaining possession of it. They are satisfied to receive a part of its\r\nrevenues. They were not permanent; their dominion was held by a thread.\r\nThe Arab dwells in tents; his magazines are in caves. When he starts\r\nupon a war expedition, he folds his tent, drives far away his beasts of\r\nburden, which transport his effects, and only carries with him his\r\nhorse and arms. Thus equipped, he goes every where; nothing arrests\r\nhim; and often, when we believe him twenty leagues distant, he is in\r\nambush at precisely rifle range from the flanks of his enemy.\r\n\r\n\"It may be thought the union of contingents might retard their\r\nmovements, but this is not so. The Arabs, whether they number ten or a\r\nhundred thousand, move with equal facility. They go where they wish and\r\nas they wish upon a campaign; the place of rendezvous merely is\r\nindicated, and they arrive there.\r\n\r\n\"What calculations can be made against such an organization as this?\r\n\r\n\"Strategy evidently loses its advantages against such enemies; a\r\ngeneral can only make conjectures; he marches to find the Arabs, and\r\nfinds them not; then, again, when he least expects it, he suddenly\r\nencounters them.\r\n\r\n\"When the Arab despairs of success in battle, he places his sole\r\nreliance upon the speed of his horse to escape destruction; and as he\r\nis always in a country where he can make his camp beside a little\r\nwater, he travels until he has placed a safe distance between himself\r\nand his enemy.\"\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nNo people probably on the face of the earth are more ambitious of\r\nmartial fame, or entertain a higher appreciation for the deeds of a\r\ndaring and successful warrior, than the North American savages. The\r\nattainment of such reputation is the paramount and absorbing object of\r\ntheir lives; all their aspirations for distinction invariably take this\r\nchannel of expression. A young man is never considered worthy to occupy\r\na seat in council until he has encountered an enemy in battle; and he\r\nwho can count the greatest number of scalps is the most highly honored\r\nby his tribe. This idea is inculcated from their earliest infancy. It\r\nis not surprising, therefore, that, with such weighty inducements\r\nbefore him, the young man who, as yet, has gained no renown as a brave\r\nor warrior, should be less discriminate in his attacks than older men\r\nwho have already acquired a name. The young braves should, therefore,\r\nbe closely watched when encountered on the Plains.\r\n\r\nThe prairie tribes are seldom at peace with all their neighbors, and\r\nsome of the young braves of a tribe are almost always absent upon a war\r\nexcursion. These forays sometimes extend into the heart of the northern\r\nstates of Mexico, where the Indians have carried on successful\r\ninvasions for many years. They have devastated and depopulated a great\r\nportion of Sonora and Chihuahua. The objects of these forays are to\r\nsteal horses and mules, and to take prisoners; and if it so happens\r\nthat a war-party has been unsuccessful in the accomplishment of these\r\nends, or has had the misfortune to lose some of its number in battle,\r\nthey become reckless, and will often attack a small party with whom\r\nthey are not at war, provided they hope to escape detection. The\r\ndisgrace attendant upon a return to their friends without some trophies\r\nas an offset to the loss of their comrades is a powerful incentive to\r\naction, and they extend but little mercy to defenseless travelers who\r\nhave the misfortune to encounter them at such a conjuncture.\r\n\r\nWhile en route from New Mexico to Arkansas in 1849 I was encamped near\r\nthe head of the Colorado River, and wishing to know the character of\r\nthe country for a few miles in advance of our position, I desired an\r\nofficer to go out and make the reconnoissance. I was lying sick in my\r\nbed at the time, or I should have performed the duty myself. I expected\r\nthe officer would have taken an escort with him, but he omitted to do\r\nso, and started off alone. After proceeding a short distance he\r\ndiscovered four mounted Indians coming at full speed directly toward\r\nhim, when, instead of turning his own horse toward camp, and\r\nendeavoring to make his escape (he was well mounted), or of halting and\r\nassuming a defensive attitude, he deliberately rode up to them; after\r\nwhich the tracks indicated that they proceeded about three miles\r\ntogether, when the Indians most brutally killed and scalped my most\r\nunfortunate but too credulous friend, who might probably have saved his\r\nlife had he not, in the kindness of his excellent heart, imagined that\r\nthe savages would reciprocate his friendly advances. He was most\r\nwoefully mistaken, and his life paid the forfeit of his generous and\r\nnoble disposition.\r\n\r\nI have never been able to get any positive information as to the\r\npersons who committed this murder, yet circumstances render it highly\r\nprobable that they were a party of young Indians who were returning\r\nfrom an unsuccessful foray, and they were unable to resist the\r\ntemptation of taking the scalp and horse of the lieutenant.\r\n\r\nA small number of white men, in traveling upon the Plains, should not\r\nallow a party of strange Indians to approach them unless able to resist\r\nan attack under the most unfavorable circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is a safe rule, when a man finds himself alone in the prairies, and\r\nsees a party of Indians approaching, not to allow them to come near\r\nhim, and if they persist in so doing, to signal them to keep away. If\r\nthey do not obey, and he be mounted upon a fleet horse, he should make\r\nfor the nearest timber. If the Indians follow and press him too\r\nclosely, he should halt, turn around, and point his gun at the\r\nforemost, which will often have the effect of turning them back, but he\r\nshould never draw trigger unless he finds that his life depends upon\r\nthe shot; for, as soon as his shot is delivered, his sole dependence,\r\nunless he have time to reload, must be upon the speed of his horse.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of the Plains, notwithstanding the encomiums that have been\r\nheaped upon their brethren who formerly occupied the Eastern States for\r\ntheir gratitude, have not, so far as I have observed, the most distant\r\nconception of that sentiment. You may confer numberless benefits upon\r\nthem for years, and the more that is done for them the more they will\r\nexpect. They do not seem to comprehend the motive which dictates an act\r\nof benevolence or charity, and they invariably attribute it to fear or\r\nthe expectation of reward. When they make a present, it is with a view\r\nof getting more than its equivalent in return.\r\n\r\nI have never yet been able to discover that the Western wild tribes\r\npossessed any of those attributes which among civilized nations are\r\nregarded as virtues adorning the human character. They have yet to be\r\ntaught the first rudiments of civilization, and they are at this time\r\nas far from any knowledge of Christianity, and as worthy subjects for\r\nmissionary enterprise, as the most untutored natives of the South Sea\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KEEP AWAY!]\r\n\r\nThe only way to make these merciless freebooters fear or respect the\r\nauthority of our government is, when they misbehave, first of all to\r\nchastise them well by striking such a blow as will be felt for a long\r\ntime, and thus show them that we are superior to them in war. They will\r\nthen respect us much more than when their good-will is purchased with\r\npresents.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of a friend of mine, who has passed the last twenty-five\r\nyears of his life among the Indians of the Rocky Mountains,\r\ncorroborates the opinions I have advanced upon this head, and although\r\nI do not endorse all of his sentiments, yet many of them are deduced\r\nfrom long and matured experience and critical observation. He says:\r\n\r\n\"They are the most onsartainest varmints in all creation, and I reckon\r\ntha'r not mor'n half human; for you never seed a human, arter you'd fed\r\nand treated him to the best fixins in your lodge, jist turn round and\r\nsteal all your horses, or ary other thing he could lay his hands on.\r\nNo, not adzackly. He would feel kinder grateful, and ask you to spread\r\na blanket in his lodge ef you ever passed that a-way. But the Injun he\r\ndon't care shucks for you, and is ready to do you a heap of mischief as\r\nsoon as he quits your feed. No, Cap.,\" he continued, \"it's not the\r\nright way to give um presents to buy peace; but ef I war governor of\r\nthese yeer United States, I'll tell you what I'd do. I'd invite um all\r\nto a big feast, and make b'lieve I wanted to have a big talk; and as\r\nsoon as I got um all together, I'd pitch in and sculp about half of um,\r\nand then t'other half would be mighty glad to make a peace that would\r\nstick. That's the way I'd make a treaty with the dog'ond, red-bellied\r\nvarmints; and as sure as you're born, Cap., that's the only way.\"\r\n\r\nI suggested to him the idea that there would be a lack of good faith\r\nand honor in such a proceeding, and that it would be much more in\r\naccordance with my notions of fair dealing to meet them openly in the\r\nfield, and there endeavor to punish them if they deserve it. To this he\r\nreplied,\r\n\r\n\"Tain't no use to talk about honor with them, Cap.; they hain't got no\r\nsuch thing in um; and they won't show fair fight, any way you can fix\r\nit. Don't they kill and sculp a white man when-ar they get the better\r\non him? The mean varmints, they'll never behave themselves until you\r\ngive um a clean out and out licking. They can't onderstand white folks'\r\nways, and they won't learn um; and ef you treat um decently, they think\r\nyou ar afeard. You may depend on't, Cap., the only way to treat Injuns\r\nis to thrash them well at first, then the balance will sorter take to\r\nyou and behave themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe wealth of the Prairie Indians consists almost exclusively in their\r\nhorses, of which they possess large numbers; and they are in the saddle\r\nfrom infancy to old age. Horsemanship is with them, as with the Arab of\r\nthe Sahara, a necessary part of their education. The country they\r\noccupy is unsuited to cultivation, and their only avocations are war,\r\nrapine, and the chase. They have no fixed habitations, but move from\r\nplace to place with the seasons and the game. All their worldly effects\r\nare transported in their migrations, and wherever their lodges are\r\npitched there is their home. They are strangers to all cares, creating\r\nfor themselves no artificial wants, and are perfectly happy and\r\ncontented so long as the buffalo is found within the limits of their\r\nwanderings. Every man is a soldier, and they generally exhibit great\r\nconfidence in their own military prowess.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEETING INDIANS.\r\n\r\nOn approaching strangers these people put their horses at full speed,\r\nand persons not familiar with their peculiarities and habits might\r\ninterpret this as an act of hostility; but it is their custom with\r\nfriends as well as enemies, and should not occasion groundless alarm.\r\n\r\nWhen a party is discovered approaching thus, and are near enough to\r\ndistinguish signals, all that is necessary in order to ascertain their\r\ndisposition is to raise the right hand with the palm in front, and\r\ngradually push it forward and back several times. They all understand\r\nthis to be a command to halt, and if they are not hostile it will at\r\nonce be obeyed.\r\n\r\nAfter they have stopped the right hand is raised again as before, and\r\nslowly moved to the right and left, which signifies \"I do not know you.\r\nWho are you?\" As all the wild tribes have their peculiar pantomimic\r\nsignals by which they are known, they will then answer the inquiry by\r\ngiving their signal. If this should not be understood, they may be\r\nasked if they are friends by raising both hands grasped in the manner\r\nof shaking hands, or by locking the two fore-fingers firmly while the\r\nhands are held up. If friendly, they will respond with the same signal;\r\nbut if enemies, they will probably disregard the command to halt, or\r\ngive the signal of anger by closing the hand, placing it against the\r\nforehead, and turning it back and forth while in that position.\r\n\r\nThe pantomimic vocabulary is understood by all the Prairie Indians, and\r\nwhen oral communication is impracticable it constitutes the court or\r\ngeneral council language of the Plains. The signs are exceedingly\r\ngraceful and significant; and, what was a fact of much astonishment to\r\nme, I discovered they were very nearly the same as those practiced by\r\nthe mutes in our deaf and dumb schools, and were comprehended by them\r\nwith perfect facility.\r\n\r\nThe Comanche is represented by making with the hand a waving motion in\r\nimitation of the crawling of a snake.\r\n\r\nThe Cheyenne, or \"Cut-arm,\" by drawing the hand across the arm, to\r\nimitate cutting it with a knife.\r\n\r\nThe Arapahoes, or \"Smellers,\" by seizing the nose with the thumb and\r\nfore-finger.\r\n\r\nThe Sioux, or \"Cut-throats,\" by drawing the hand across the throat.\r\n\r\nThe Pawnees, or \"Wolves,\" by placing a hand on each side of the\r\nforehead, with two fingers pointing to the front, to represent the\r\nnarrow, sharp ears of the wolf.\r\n\r\nThe Crows, by imitating the flapping of the bird's wings with the palms\r\nof the hands.\r\n\r\nWhen Indians meet a party of strangers, and are disposed to be\r\nfriendly, the chiefs, after the usual salutations have been exchanged,\r\ngenerally ride out and accompany the commander of the party some\r\ndistance, holding a friendly talk, and, at the same time, indulging\r\ntheir curiosity by learning the news, etc. Phlegmatic and indifferent\r\nas they appear to be, they are very inquisitive and observing, and, at\r\nthe same time, exceedingly circumspect and cautious about disclosing\r\ntheir own purposes.\r\n\r\nThey are always desirous of procuring, from whomsoever they meet,\r\ntestimonials of their good behavior, which they preserve with great\r\ncare, and exhibit upon all occasions to strangers as a guarantee of\r\nfuture good conduct.\r\n\r\nOn meeting with a chief of the Southern Comanches in 1849, after going\r\nthrough the usual ceremony of embracing, and assuring me that he was\r\nthe best friend the Americans ever had among the Indians, he exhibited\r\nnumerous certificates from the different white men he had met with,\r\ntestifying to his friendly disposition. Among these was one that he\r\ndesired me to read with special attention, as he said he was of the\r\nopinion that perhaps it might not be so complimentary in its character\r\nas some of the others. It was in these words:\r\n\r\n    \"The bearer of this says he is a Comanche chief, named Senaco;\r\n    that he is the biggest Indian and best friend the whites ever\r\n    had; in fact, that he is a first-rate fellow; but I believe he\r\n    is a d----d rascal, _so look out for him_.\"\r\n\r\nI smiled on reading the paper, and, looking up, found the chief's eyes\r\nintently fixed upon mine with an expression of the most earnest\r\ninquiry. I told him the paper was not as good as it might be, whereupon\r\nhe destroyed it.\r\n\r\nFive years after this interview I met Senaco again near the same place.\r\nHe recognized me at once, and, much to my surprise, pronounced my name\r\nquite distinctly.\r\n\r\nA circumstance which happened in my interview with this Indian shows\r\ntheir character for diplomatic policy.\r\n\r\nI was about locating and surveying a reservation of land upon which the\r\ngovernment designed to establish the Comanches, and was desirous of\r\nascertaining whether they were disposed voluntarily to come into the\r\nmeasure. In this connection, I stated to him that their Great Father,\r\nthe President, being anxious to improve their condition, was willing to\r\ngive them a permanent location, where they could cultivate the soil,\r\nand, if they wished it, he would send white men to teach them the\r\nrudiments of agriculture, supply them with farming utensils, and all\r\nother requisites for living comfortably in their new homes. I then\r\ndesired him to consult with his people, and let me know what their\r\nviews were upon the subject.\r\n\r\nAfter talking a considerable time with his head men, he rose to reply,\r\nand said, \"He was very happy to learn that the President remembered his\r\npoor red children in the Plains, and he was glad to see me again, and\r\nhear from me that their Great Father was their friend; that he was also\r\nvery much gratified to meet his agent who was present, and that he\r\nshould remember with much satisfaction the agreeable interview we had\r\nhad upon that occasion.\" After delivering himself of numerous other\r\nnon-committal expressions of similar import, he closed his speech and\r\ntook his seat without making the slightest allusion to the subject in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nOn reminding him of this omission, and again demanding from him a\r\ndistinct and categorical answer, he, after a brief consultation with\r\nhis people, replied that his talk was made and concluded, and he did\r\nnot comprehend why it was that I wanted to open the subject anew. But,\r\nas I continued to press him for an answer, he at length said, \"You come\r\ninto our country and select a small patch of ground, around which you\r\nrun a line, and tell us the President will make us a present of this to\r\nlive upon, when every body knows that the whole of this entire country,\r\nfrom the Red River to the Colorado, is now, and always has been, ours\r\nfrom time immemorial. I suppose, however, if the President tells us to\r\nconfine ourselves to these narrow limits, we shall be forced to do so,\r\nwhether we desire it or not.\"\r\n\r\nHe was evidently averse to the proposed change in their mode of life,\r\nand has been at war ever since the establishment of the settlement.\r\n\r\nThe mode of life of the nomadic tribes, owing to their unsettled and\r\nwarlike habits, is such as to render their condition one of constant\r\ndanger and apprehension. The security of their numerous animals from\r\nthe encroachments of their enemies and habitual liability to attacks\r\ncompels them to be at all times upon the alert. Even during profound\r\npeace they guard their herds both night and day, while scouts are often\r\npatrolling upon the surrounding heights to give notice of the approach\r\nof strangers, and enable them to secure their animals and take a\r\ndefensive attitude.\r\n\r\nWhen one of these people conceives himself injured his thirst for\r\nrevenge is insatiable. Grave and dignified in his outward bearing, and\r\npriding himself upon never exhibiting curiosity, joy, or anger, yet\r\nwhen once roused he evinces the implacable dispositions of his race;\r\nthe affront is laid up and cherished in his breast, and nothing can\r\nefface it from his mind until ample reparation is made. The insult must\r\nbe atoned for by presents, or be washed out with blood.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR EXPEDITIONS.\r\n\r\nWhen a chief desires to organize a war-party, he provides himself with\r\na long pole, attaches a red flag to the end of it, and trims the top\r\nwith eagle feathers. He then mounts his horse in his war-costume, and\r\nrides around through the camp singing the war-song. Those who are\r\ndisposed to join the expedition mount their horses and fall into the\r\nprocession; after parading about for a time, all dismount, and the\r\nwar-dance is performed. This ceremony is continued from day to day\r\nuntil a sufficient number of volunteers are found to accomplish the\r\nobjects desired, when they set out for the theatre of their intended\r\nexploits.\r\n\r\nAs they proceed upon their expedition, it sometimes happens that the\r\nchief with whom it originated, and who invariably assumes the command,\r\nbecomes discouraged at not finding an opportunity of displaying his\r\nwarlike abilities, and abandons the enterprise; in which event, if\r\nothers of the party desire to proceed farther, they select another\r\nleader and push on, and thus so long as any one of the party holds out.\r\n\r\nA war-party is sometimes absent for a great length of time, and for\r\ndays, weeks, and months their friends at home anxiously await their\r\nreturn, until, suddenly, from afar, the shrill war-cry of an _avant\r\ncourier_ is heard proclaiming the approach of the victorious warriors.\r\nThe camp is in an instant alive with excitement and commotion. Men,\r\nwomen, and children swarm out to meet the advancing party. Their white\r\nhorses are painted and decked out in the most fantastic style, and led\r\nin advance of the triumphal procession; and, as they pass around\r\nthrough the village, the old women set up a most unearthly howl of\r\nexultation, after which the scalp-dance is performed with all the pomp\r\nand display their limited resources admit of, the warriors having their\r\nfaces painted black.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the other hand, the expedition terminates disastrously by the\r\nloss of some of the party in battle, the relatives of the deceased cut\r\noff their own hair, and the tails and manes of their horses, as symbols\r\nof mourning, and howl and cry for a long time.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 I saw the widow of a former chief of the Southern Comanches,\r\nwhose husband had been dead about three years, yet she continued her\r\nmourning tribute to his memory by crying daily for him and refusing all\r\noffers to marry again.\r\n\r\nThe prairie warrior is occasionally seen with the rifle in his hand,\r\nbut his favorite arm is the bow, the use of which is taught him at an\r\nearly age. By constant practice he acquires a skill in archery that\r\nrenders him no less formidable in war than successful in the chase.\r\nTheir bows are usually made of the tough and elastic wood of the\r\n\"_bois d'are_,\" strengthened and re-enforced with sinews of the deer\r\nwrapped firmly around, and strung with a cord of the same material.\r\nThey are from three to four feet long. The arrows, which are carried in\r\na quiver upon the back, are about twenty inches long, of flexible wood,\r\nwith a triangular iron point at one end, and at the other two feathers\r\nintersecting at right angles.\r\n\r\nAt short distances (about fifty yards), the bow, in the hands of the\r\nIndian, is effective, and in close proximity with the buffalo throws\r\nthe arrow entirely through his huge carcass. In using this weapon the\r\nwarrior protects himself from the missiles of his enemy with a shield\r\nmade of two thicknesses of undressed buffalo hide filled in with hair.\r\n\r\nThe Comanches, Sioux, and other prairie tribes make their attacks upon\r\nthe open prairies. Trusting to their wonderful skill in equitation and\r\nhorsemanship, they ride around their enemies with their bodies thrown\r\nupon the opposite side of the horse, and discharge their arrows in\r\nrapid succession while at full speed; they will not, however, often\r\nventure near an enemy who occupies a defensive position. If, therefore,\r\na small party be in danger of an attack from a large force of Indians,\r\nthey should seek the cover of timber or a park of wagons, or, in the\r\nabsence of these, rocks or holes in the prairie which afford good\r\ncover.\r\n\r\nAttempts to stampede animals are often made when parties first arrive\r\nin camp, and when every one's attention is preoccupied in the\r\narrangements therewith connected. In a country infested by hostile\r\nIndians, the ground in the vicinity of which it is proposed to encamp\r\nshould be cautiously examined for tracks and other Indian _signs_\r\nby making a circuit around the locality previous to unharnessing the\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nAfter Indians have succeeded in stampeding a herd of horses or mules,\r\nand desire to drive them away, they are in the habit of pushing them\r\nforward as rapidly as possible for the first few days, in order to\r\nplace a wide interval between themselves and any party that may be in\r\npursuit.\r\n\r\nIn running off stolen animals, the Indians are generally divided into\r\ntwo parties, one for driving and the other to act as a rear guard.\r\nBefore they reach a place where they propose making a halt, they leave\r\na vidette upon some prominent point to watch for pursuers and give the\r\nmain party timely warning, enabling them to rally their animals and\r\npush forward again.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRACKING INDIANS.\r\n\r\nWhen an Indian sentinel intends to watch for an enemy approaching from\r\nthe rear, he selects the highest position available, and places himself\r\nnear the summit in such an attitude that his entire body shall be\r\nconcealed from the observation of any one in the rear, his head only\r\nbeing exposed above the top of the eminence. Here he awaits with great\r\npatience so long as he thinks there is any possibility of danger, and\r\nit will be difficult for an enemy to surprise him or to elude his keen\r\nand scrutinizing vigilance. Meanwhile his horse is secured under the\r\nscreen of the hill, all ready when required. Hence it will be evident\r\nthat, in following Indian depredators, the utmost vigilance and caution\r\nmust be exercised to conceal from them the movements of their pursuers.\r\nThey are the best scouts in the world, proficient in all the artifices\r\nand stratagems available in border warfare, and when hotly pursued by a\r\nsuperior force, after exhausting all other means of evasion, they\r\nscatter in different directions; and if, in a broken or mountainous\r\ncountry, they can do no better, abandon their horses and baggage, and\r\ntake refuge in the rocks, gorges, or other hiding-places. This plan has\r\nseveral times been resorted to by Indians in Texas when surprised, and,\r\nnotwithstanding their pursuers were directly upon them, the majority\r\nmade their escape, leaving behind all their animals and other property.\r\n\r\nFor overtaking a marauding party of Indians who have advanced eight or\r\nten hours before the pursuing party are in readiness to take the trail,\r\nit is not best to push forward rapidly at first, as this will weary and\r\nbreak down horses. The Indians must be supposed to have at least fifty\r\nor sixty miles the start; it will, therefore, be useless to think of\r\novertaking them without providing for a long chase. Scouts should\r\ncontinually be kept out in front upon the trail to reconnoitre and give\r\npreconcerted signals to the main party when the Indians are espied.\r\n\r\nIn approaching all eminences or undulations in the prairies, the\r\ncommander should be careful not to allow any considerable number of his\r\nmen to pass upon the summits until the country around has been\r\ncarefully reconnoitred by the scouts, who will cautiously raise their\r\neyes above the crests of the most elevated points, making a\r\nscrutinizing examination in all directions; and, while doing this,\r\nshould an Indian be encountered who has been left behind as a sentinel,\r\nhe must, if possible, be secured or shot, to prevent his giving the\r\nalarm to his comrades. These precautions can not be too rigidly\r\nenforced when the trail becomes \"warm;\" and if there be a moon, it will\r\nbe better to lie by in the daytime and follow the trail at night, as\r\nthe great object is to come upon the Indians when they are not\r\nanticipating an attack. Such surprises, if discreetly conducted;\r\ngenerally prove successful.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Indians are discovered in their bivouac, the pursuing\r\nparty should dismount, leave their horses under charge of a guard in\r\nsome sequestered place, and, before advancing to the attack, the men\r\nshould be instructed in signals for their different movements, such as\r\nall will easily comprehend and remember. As, for example, a pull upon\r\nthe right arm may signify to face to the right, and a pull upon the\r\nleft arm to face to the left; a pull upon the skirt of the coat, to\r\nhalt; a gentle push on the back, to advance in ordinary time; a slap on\r\nthe back, to advance in double quick time, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThese signals, having been previously well understood and practiced,\r\nmay be given by the commander to the man next to him, and from him\r\ncommunicated in rapid succession throughout the command.\r\n\r\nI will suppose the party formed in one rank, with the commander on the\r\nright. He gives the signal, and the men move off cautiously in the\r\ndirection indicated. The importance of not losing sight of his comrades\r\non his right and left, and of not allowing them to get out of his\r\nreach, so as to break the chain of communication, will be apparent to\r\nall, and great care should be taken that the men do not mistake their\r\nbrothers in arms for the enemy. This may be prevented by having two\r\n_pass-words_, and when there be any doubt as to the identity of two\r\nmen who meet during the night operations, one of these words may be\r\nrepeated by each. Above all, the men must be fully impressed with the\r\nimportance of not firing a shot until the order is given by the\r\ncommanding officer, and also that a rigorous personal accountability\r\nwill be enforced in all cases of a violation of this rule.\r\n\r\nIf the commander gives the signal for commencing the attack by firing a\r\npistol or gun, there will probably be no mistake, unless it happens\r\nthrough carelessness by the accidental discharge of firearms.\r\n\r\nI can conceive of nothing more appalling, or that tends more to throw\r\nmen off their guard and produce confusion, than a sudden and unexpected\r\nnight-attack. Even the Indians, who pride themselves upon their\r\ncoolness and self-possession, are far from being exempt from its\r\neffects; and it is not surprising that men who go to sleep with a sense\r\nof perfect security around them, and are suddenly aroused from a sound\r\nslumber by the terrific sounds of an onslaught from an enemy, should\r\nlose their presence of mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAPHING BY SMOKES.\r\n\r\nThe transparency of the atmosphere upon the Plains is such that objects\r\ncan be seen at great distances; a mountain, for example, presents a\r\ndistinct and bold outline at fifty or sixty miles, and may occasionally\r\nbe seen as far as a hundred miles.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, availing themselves of this fact, have been in the habit\r\nof practicing a system of telegraphing by means of smokes during the\r\nday and fires by night, and, I dare say, there are but few travelers\r\nwho have crossed the mountains to California that have not seen these\r\nsignals made and responded to from peak to peak in rapid succession.\r\n\r\nThe Indians thus make known to their friends many items of information\r\nhighly important to them. If enemies or strangers make their appearance\r\nin the country, the fact is telegraphed at once, giving them time to\r\nsecure their animals and to prepare for attack, defense, or flight.\r\n\r\nWar or hunting parties, after having been absent a long time from their\r\nerratic friends at home, and not knowing where to find them, make use\r\nof the same preconcerted signals to indicate their presence.\r\n\r\nVery dense smokes may be raised by kindling a large fire with dry wood,\r\nand piling upon it the green boughs of pine, balsam, or hemlock. This\r\nthrows off a heavy cloud of black smoke which can be seen very far.\r\n\r\nThis simple method of telegraphing, so useful to the savages both in\r\nwar and in peace, may, in my judgment, be used to advantage in the\r\nmovements of troops co-operating in separate columns in the Indian\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt at this time to present a matured system of\r\nsignals, but will merely give a few suggestions tending to illustrate\r\nthe advantages to be derived from the use of them.\r\n\r\nFor example, when two columns are marching through a country at such\r\ndistances apart that smokes may be seen from one to the other, their\r\nrespective positions may be made known to each other at any time by two\r\nsmokes raised simultaneously or at certain preconcerted intervals.\r\n\r\nShould the commander of one column desire to communicate with the\r\nother, he raises three smokes simultaneously, which, if seen by the\r\nother party, should be responded to in the same manner. They would then\r\nhold themselves in readiness for any other communications.\r\n\r\nIf an enemy is discovered in small numbers, a smoke raised twice at\r\nfifteen minutes' interval would indicate it; and if in large force,\r\nthree times with the same intervals might be the signal.\r\n\r\nShould the commander of one party desire the other to join him, this\r\nmight be telegraphed by four smokes at ten minutes' interval.\r\n\r\nShould it become necessary to change the direction of the line of\r\nmarch, the commander may transmit the order by means of two\r\nsimultaneous smokes raised a certain number of times to indicate the\r\nparticular direction; for instance, twice for north, three times for\r\nsouth, four times for east, and five times for west; three smokes\r\nraised twice for northeast, three times for northwest, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nBy multiplying the combinations of signals a great variety of messages\r\nmight be transmitted in this manner; but, to avoid mistakes, the\r\nsignals should be written down and copies furnished the commander of\r\neach separate party, and they need not necessarily be made known to\r\nother persons.\r\n\r\nDuring the day an intelligent man should be detailed to keep a vigilant\r\nlook-out in all directions for smokes, and he should be furnished with\r\na watch, pencil, and paper, to make a record of the signals, with their\r\nnumber, and the time of the intervals between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nHunting. Its Benefits to the Soldier. Buffalo. Deer. Antelope. Bear.\r\nBig-horn, or Mountain Sheep. Their Habits, and Hints upon the best\r\nMethods of hunting them.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNTING.\r\n\r\nI know of no better school of practice for perfecting men in\r\ntarget-firing, and the use of firearms generally, than that in which\r\nthe frontier hunter receives his education. One of the first and most\r\nimportant lessons that he is taught impresses him with the conviction\r\nthat, unless his gun is in good order and steadily directed upon the\r\ngame, he must go without his supper; and if ambition does not stimulate\r\nhis efforts, his appetite will, and ultimately lead to success and\r\nconfidence in his own powers.\r\n\r\nThe man who is afraid to place the butt of his piece firmly against his\r\nshoulder, or who turns away his head at the instant of pulling trigger\r\n(as soldiers often do before they have been drilled at target-practice),\r\nwill not be likely to bag much game or to contribute materially toward\r\nthe result of a battle. The successful hunter, as a general rule, is a\r\ngood shot, will always charge his gun properly, and may be relied upon\r\nin action. I would, therefore, when in garrison or at permanent camps,\r\nencourage officers and soldiers in field-sports. If permitted, men very\r\nreadily cultivate a fondness for these innocent and healthy exercises,\r\nand occupy their leisure time in their pursuit; whereas, if confined to\r\nthe narrow limits of a frontier camp or garrison, having no amusements\r\nwithin their reach, they are prone to indulge in practices which are\r\nhighly detrimental to their physical and moral condition.\r\n\r\nBy making short excursions about the country they acquire a knowledge\r\nof it, become inured to fatigue, learn the art of bivouacking,\r\ntrailing, etc., etc., all of which will be found serviceable in border\r\nwarfare; and, even if they should perchance now and then miss some of\r\nthe minor routine duties of the garrison, the benefits they would\r\nderive from hunting would, in my opinion, more than counterbalance its\r\neffects. Under the old regime it was thought that drills,\r\ndress-parades, and guard-mountings comprehended the sum total of the\r\nsoldier's education, but the experience of the last ten years has\r\ntaught us that these are only the rudiments, and that to combat\r\nsuccessfully with Indians we must receive instruction from them, study\r\ntheir tactics, and, where they suit our purposes, copy from them.\r\n\r\nThe union of discipline with the individuality, self-reliance, and\r\nrapidity of locomotion of the savage is what we should aim at. This\r\nwill be the tendency of the course indicated, and it is conceived by\r\nthe writer that an army composed of well-disciplined hunters will be\r\nthe most efficient of all others against the only enemy we have to\r\nencounter within the limits of our vast possessions.\r\n\r\nI find some pertinent remarks upon this subject in a very sensible\r\nessay by \"a late captain of infantry\" (U.S.). He says:\r\n\r\n\"It is conceived that scattered bands of mounted hunters, with the\r\nspeed of a horse and the watchfulness of a wolf or antelope, whose\r\nfaculties are sharpened by their necessities; who, when they get short\r\nof provisions, separate and look for something to eat, and find it in\r\nthe water, in the ground, or on the surface; whose bill of fare ranges\r\nfrom grass-seed, nuts, roots, grasshoppers, lizards, and rattlesnakes\r\nup to the antelope, deer, elk, bear, and buffalo, and who have a\r\ncontinent to roam over, will be neither surprised, caught, conquered,\r\noverawed, or reduced to famine by a rumbling, bugle-blowing,\r\ndrum-beating town passing through their country on wheels at the speed\r\nof a loaded wagon.\r\n\r\n\"If the Indians are in the path and do not wish to be seen, they cross\r\na ridge, and the town moves on, ignorant whether there are fifty\r\nIndians within a mile or no Indian within fifty miles. If the Indians\r\nwish to see, they return to the crest of the ridge, crawl up to the\r\nedge, pull up a bunch of grass by the roots, and look through or under\r\nit at the procession.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough I would always encourage men in hunting when permanently\r\nlocated, yet, unless they are good woodsmen, it is not safe to permit\r\nthem to go out alone in marching through the Indian country, as, aside\r\nfrom the danger of encountering Indians, they would be liable to become\r\nbewildered and perhaps lost, and this might detain the entire party in\r\nsearching for them. The better plan upon a march is for three or four\r\nto go out together, accompanied by a good woodsman, who will be able\r\nwith certainty to lead them back to camp.\r\n\r\nThe little group could ascertain if Indians are about, and would be\r\nstrong enough to act on the defensive against small parties of them;\r\nand, while they are amusing themselves, they may perform an important\r\npart as scouts and flankers.\r\n\r\nAn expedition may have been perfectly organized, and every thing\r\nprovided that the wisest forethought could suggest, yet circumstances\r\nbeyond the control of the most experienced traveler may sometimes arise\r\nto defeat the best concerted plans. It is not, for example, an\r\nimpossible contingency that the traveler may, by unforeseen delays,\r\nconsume his provisions, lose them in crossing streams, or have them\r\nstolen by hostile Indians, and be reduced to the necessity of depending\r\nupon game for subsistence. Under these circumstances, a few\r\nobservations upon the habits of the different animals that frequent the\r\nPlains and on the best methods of hunting them may not be altogether\r\ndevoid of interest or utility in this connection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUFFALO.\r\n\r\nThe largest and most useful animal that roams over the prairies is the\r\nbuffalo. It provides food, clothing, and shelter to thousands of\r\nnatives whose means of livelihood depend almost exclusively upon this\r\ngigantic monarch of the prairies.\r\n\r\nNot many years since they thronged in countless multitudes over all\r\nthat vast area lying between Mexico and the British possessions, but\r\nnow their range is confined within very narrow limits, and a few more\r\nyears will probably witness the extinction of the species.\r\n\r\nThe traveler, in passing from Texas or Arkansas through southern New\r\nMexico to California, does not, at the present day, encounter the\r\nbuffalo; but upon all the routes north of latitude 36 deg. the animal is\r\nstill found between the 99th and 102d meridians of longitude.\r\n\r\nAlthough generally regarded as migratory in their habits, yet the\r\nbuffalo often _winter_ in the snows of a high northern latitude. Early\r\nin the spring of 1858 I found them in the Rocky Mountains, at the head\r\nof the Arkansas and South Platte Rivers, and there was every indication\r\nthat this was a permanent abiding-place for them.\r\n\r\nThere are two methods generally practiced in hunting the buffalo, viz.:\r\nrunning them on horseback, and stalking, or still-hunting. The first\r\nmethod requires a sure-footed and tolerably fleet horse that is not\r\neasily frightened. The buffalo cow, which makes much better beef than\r\nthe bull, when pursued by the hunter runs rapidly, and, unless the\r\nhorse be fleet, it requires a long and exhausting chase to overtake\r\nher.\r\n\r\nWhen the buffalo are discovered, and the hunter intends to give chase,\r\nhe should first dismount, arrange his saddle-blanket and saddle, buckle\r\nthe girth tight, and make every thing about his horse furniture snug\r\nand secure. He should then put his arms in good firing order, and,\r\ntaking the lee side of the herd, so that they may not get \"_the\r\nwind_\" of him, he should approach in a walk as close as possible,\r\ntaking advantage of any cover that may offer. His horse then, being\r\ncool and fresh, will be able to dash into the herd, and probably carry\r\nhis rider very near the animal he has selected before he becomes\r\nalarmed.\r\n\r\nIf the hunter be right-handed, and uses a pistol, he should approach\r\nupon the left side, and when nearly opposite and close upon the\r\nbuffalo, deliver his shot, taking aim a little below the centre of the\r\nbody, and about eight inches back of the shoulder. This will strike the\r\nvitals, and generally render another shot unnecessary.\r\n\r\nWhen a rifle or shot-gun is used the hunter rides up on the right side,\r\nkeeping his horse well in hand, so as to be able to turn off if the\r\nbeast charges upon him; this, however, never happens except with a\r\nbuffalo that is wounded, when it is advisable to keep out of his reach.\r\n\r\nThe buffalo has immense powers of endurance, and will run for many\r\nmiles without any apparent effort or diminution in speed. The first\r\nbuffalo I ever saw I followed about ten miles, and when I left him he\r\nseemed to run faster than when the chase commenced.\r\n\r\nAs a long buffalo-chase is very severe labor upon a horse, I would\r\nrecommend to all travelers, unless they have a good deal of surplus\r\nhorse-flesh, never to expend it in running buffalo.\r\n\r\nStill-hunting, which requires no consumption of horse-flesh, and is\r\nequally successful with the other method, is recommended. In stalking\r\non horseback, the most broken and hilly localities should be selected,\r\nas these will furnish cover to the hunter, who passes from the crest of\r\none hill to another, examining the country carefully in all directions.\r\nWhen the game is discovered, if it happen to be on the lee side, the\r\nhunter should endeavor, by making a wide detour, to get upon the\r\nopposite side, as he will find it impossible to approach within rifle\r\nrange with the wind.\r\n\r\nWhen the animal is upon a hill, or in any other position where he can\r\nnot be approached without danger of disturbing him, the hunter should\r\nwait until he moves off to more favorable ground, and this will not\r\ngenerally require much time, as they wander about a great deal when not\r\ngrazing; he then pickets his horse, and approaches cautiously, seeking\r\nto screen himself as much as possible by the undulations in the\r\nsurface, or behind such other objects as may present themselves; but if\r\nthe surface should offer no cover, he must crawl upon his hands and\r\nknees when near the game, and in this way he can generally get within\r\nrifle range.\r\n\r\nShould there be several animals together, and his first shot take\r\neffect, the hunter can often get several other shots before they become\r\nfrightened. A Delaware Indian and myself once killed five buffaloes out\r\nof a small herd before the remainder were so much disturbed as to move\r\naway; although we were within the short distance of twenty yards, yet\r\nthe reports of our rifles did not frighten them in the least, and they\r\ncontinued grazing during all the time we were loading and firing.\r\n\r\nThe sense of smelling is exceedingly acute with the buffalo, and they\r\nwill take the wind from the hunter at as great a distance as a mile.\r\n\r\nWhen the animal is wounded, and stops, it is better not to go near him\r\nuntil he lies down, as he will often run a great distance if disturbed;\r\nbut if left to himself, will in many cases die in a short time.\r\n\r\nThe tongues, humps, and marrow-bones are regarded as the choice parts\r\nof the animal. The tongue is taken out by ripping open the skin between\r\nthe prongs of the lower jaw-bone and pulling it out through the\r\norifice. The hump may be taken off by skinning down on each side of the\r\nshoulders and cutting away the meat, after which the hump-ribs can be\r\nunjointed where they unite with the spine. The marrow, when roasted in\r\nthe bones, is delicious.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEER.\r\n\r\nOf all game quadrupeds indigenous to this continent, the common red\r\ndeer is probably more widely dispersed from north to south and from\r\neast to west over our vast possessions than any other. They are found\r\nin all latitudes from Hudson's Bay to Mexico, and they clamber over the\r\nmost elevated peaks of the western sierras with the same ease that they\r\nrange the eastern forests or the everglades of Florida. In summer they\r\ncrop the grass upon the summits of the Rocky Mountains, and in winter,\r\nwhen the snow falls deep, they descend into sheltered valleys, where\r\nthey fall an easy prey to the Indians.\r\n\r\nBesides the common red deer of the Eastern States, two other varieties\r\nare found in the Rocky Mountains, viz., the \"black-tailed deer,\" which\r\ntakes its name from the fact of its having a small tuft of black hair\r\nupon the end of its tail, and the _long-tailed_ species. The former of\r\nthese is considerably larger than the eastern deer, and is much darker,\r\nbeing of a very deep-yellowish iron-gray, with a yellowish red upon the\r\nbelly. It frequents the mountains, and is never seen far away from\r\nthem. Its habits are similar to those of the red deer, and it is hunted\r\nin the same way. The only difference I have been able to discern\r\nbetween the long-tailed variety and the common deer is in the length of\r\nthe tail and body. I have seen this animal only in the neighborhood of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, but it may resort to other localities.\r\n\r\nAlthough the deer are still abundant in many of our forest districts in\r\nthe east, and do not appear to decrease very rapidly, yet there has\r\nwithin a few years been a very evident diminution in the numbers of\r\nthose frequenting our Western prairies. In passing through Southern\r\nTexas in 1846, thousands of deer were met with daily, and, astonishing\r\nas it may appear, it was no uncommon spectacle to see from one to two\r\nhundred in a single herd; the prairies seemed literally alive with\r\nthem; but in 1855 it was seldom that a herd often was seen in the same\r\nlocalities. It seemed to me that the vast herds first met with could\r\nnot have been killed off by the hunters in that sparsely-populated\r\nsection, and I was puzzled to know what had become of them. It is\r\npossible they may have moved off into Mexico; they certainly are not in\r\nour territory at the present time.\r\n\r\nTwenty years' experience in deer-hunting has taught me several facts\r\nrelative to the habits of the animal which, when well understood, will\r\nbe found of much service to the inexperienced hunter, and greatly\r\ncontribute to his success. The best target-shots are not necessarily\r\nthe most skillful deer-stalkers. One of the great secrets of this art\r\nis in knowing how to approach the game without giving alarm, and this\r\ncan not easily be done unless the hunter sees it before he is himself\r\ndiscovered. There are so many objects in the woods resembling the deer\r\nin color that none but a practiced eye can often detect the difference.\r\n\r\nWhen the deer is reposing he generally turns his head from the wind, in\r\nwhich position he can see an enemy approaching from that direction, and\r\nhis nose will apprise him of the presence of danger from the opposite\r\nside. The best method of hunting deer, therefore, is _across the wind_.\r\n\r\nWhile the deer are feeding, early in the morning and a short time\r\nbefore dark in the evening are the best times to stalk them, as they\r\nare then busily occupied and less on the alert. When a deer is espied\r\nwith his head down, cropping the grass, the hunter advances cautiously,\r\nkeeping his eyes constantly directed upon him, and screening himself\r\nbehind intervening objects, or, in the absence of other cover, crawls\r\nalong upon his hands and knees in the grass, until the deer hears his\r\nsteps and raises his head, when he must instantly stop and remain in an\r\nattitude fixed and motionless as a statue, for the animal's vision is\r\nhis keenest sense. When alarmed he will detect the slightest movement\r\nof a small object, and, unless the hunter stands or lies perfectly\r\nstill, his presence will be detected. If the hunter does not move, the\r\ndeer will, after a short time, recover from his alarm and resume his\r\ngrazing, when he may be again approached. The deer always exhibits his\r\nalarm by a sudden jerking of the tail just before he raises his head.\r\n\r\nI once saw a Delaware Indian walk directly up within rifle range of a\r\ndeer that was feeding upon the open prairie and shoot him down; he was,\r\nhowever, a long time in approaching, and made frequent halts whenever\r\nthe animal flirted his tail and raised his head. Although he often\r\nturned toward the hunter, yet he did not appear to notice him, probably\r\ntaking him for a stump or tree.\r\n\r\nWhen the deer are lying down in the smooth prairie, unless the grass is\r\ntall, it is difficult to get near them, as they are generally looking\r\naround, and become alarmed at the least noise.\r\n\r\nThe Indians are in the habit of using a small instrument which imitates\r\nthe bleat of the young fawn, with which they lure the doe within range\r\nof their rifles. The young fawn gives out no scent upon its track until\r\nit is sufficiently grown to make good running, and instinct teaches the\r\nmother that this wise provision of nature to preserve the helpless\r\nlittle quadruped from the ravages of wolves, panthers, and other\r\ncarnivorous beasts, will be defeated if she remains with it, as her\r\ntracks can not be concealed. She therefore hides her fawn in the grass,\r\nwhere it is almost impossible to see it, even when very near it, goes\r\noff to some neighboring thicket within call, and makes her bed alone.\r\nThe Indian pot-hunter, who is but little scrupulous as to the means he\r\nemploys in accomplishing his ends, sounds the bleat along near the\r\nplaces where he thinks the game is lying, and the unsuspicious doe, who\r\nimagines that her offspring is in distress, rushes with headlong\r\nimpetuosity toward the sound, and often goes within a few yards of the\r\nhunter to receive her death-wound.\r\n\r\nThis is cruel sport, and can only be justified when meat is scarce,\r\nwhich is very frequently the case in the Indian's larder.\r\n\r\nIt does not always comport with a man's feelings of security,\r\nespecially if he happens to be a little nervous, to sound the\r\ndeer-bleat in a wild region of country. I once undertook to experiment\r\nwith the instrument myself, and made my first essay in attempting to\r\ncall up an antelope which I discovered in the distance. I succeeded\r\nadmirably in luring the wary victim within shooting range, had raised\r\nupon my knees, and was just in the act of pulling trigger, when a\r\nrustling in the grass on my left drew my attention in that direction,\r\nwhere, much to my surprise, I beheld a huge panther within about twenty\r\nyards, bounding with gigantic strides directly toward me. I turned my\r\nrifle, and in an instant, much to my relief and gratification, its\r\ncontents were lodged in the heart of the beast.\r\n\r\nMany men, when they suddenly encounter a deer, are seized with nervous\r\nexcitement, called in sporting parlance the \"_buck fever_,\" which\r\ncauses them to fire at random. Notwithstanding I have had much\r\nexperience in hunting, I must confess that I am never entirely free\r\nfrom some of the symptoms of this malady when firing at large game, and\r\nI believe that in four out of five cases where I have missed the game\r\nmy balls have passed too high. I have endeavored to obviate this by\r\nsighting my rifle low, and it has been attended with more successful\r\nresults. The same remarks apply to most other men I have met with. They\r\nfire too high when excited.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANTELOPE.\r\n\r\nThis animal frequents the most elevated bleak and naked prairies in all\r\nlatitudes from Mexico to Oregon, and constitutes an important item of\r\nsubsistence with many of the Prairie Indians. It is the most wary,\r\ntimid, and fleet animal that inhabits the Plains. It is about the size\r\nof a small deer, with a heavy coating of coarse, wiry hair, and its\r\nflesh is more tender and juicy than that of the deer. It seldom enters\r\na timbered country, but seems to delight in cropping the grass from the\r\nelevated swells of the prairies. When disturbed by the traveler, it\r\nwill circle around him with the speed of the wind, but does not stop\r\nuntil it reaches some prominent position whence it can survey the\r\ncountry on all sides, and nothing seems to escape its keen vision. They\r\nwill sometimes stand for a long time and look at a man, provided he\r\ndoes not move or go out of sight; but if he goes behind a hill with the\r\nintention of passing around and getting nearer to them, he will never\r\nfind them again in the same place. I have often tried the experiment,\r\nand invariably found that, as soon as I went where the antelope could\r\nnot see me, he moved off. Their sense of hearing, as well as vision, is\r\nvery acute, which renders it difficult to stalk them. By taking\r\nadvantage of the cover afforded in broken ground, the hunter may, by\r\nmoving slowly and cautiously over the crests of the irregularities in\r\nthe surface, sometimes approach within rifle range.\r\n\r\nThe antelope possesses a greater degree of curiosity than any other\r\nanimal I know of, and will often approach very near a strange object.\r\nThe experienced hunter, taking advantage of this peculiarity, lies down\r\nand secretes himself in the grass, after which he raises his\r\nhandkerchief, hand, or foot, so as to attract the attention of the\r\nanimal, and thus often succeeds in beguiling him within shooting\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nIn some valleys near the Rocky Mountains, where the pasturage is good\r\nduring the winter season, they collect in immense herds. The Indians\r\nare in the habit of surrounding them in such localities and running\r\nthem with their horses until they tire them out, when they slay large\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALLING UP ANTELOPES.]\r\n\r\nThe antelope makes a track much shorter than the deer, very broad and\r\nround at the heel, and quite sharp at the toe; a little experience\r\nrenders it easy to distinguish them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEAR.\r\n\r\nBesides the common black bear of the Eastern States, several others are\r\nfound in the mountains of California, Oregon, Utah, and New Mexico,\r\nviz., the grizzly, brown, and cinnamon varieties; all have nearly the\r\nsame habits, and are hunted in the same manner.\r\n\r\nFrom all I had heard of the grizzly bear, I was induced to believe him\r\none of the most formidable and savage animals in the universe, and that\r\nthe man who would deliberately encounter and kill one of these beasts\r\nhad performed a signal feat of courage which entitled him to a lofty\r\nposition among the votaries of Nimrod. So firmly had I become impressed\r\nwith this conviction, that I should have been very reluctant to fire\r\nupon one had I met him when alone and on foot. The grizzly bear is\r\nassuredly the monarch of the American forests, and, so far as physical\r\nstrength is concerned, he is perhaps without a rival in the world; but,\r\nafter some experience in hunting, my opinions regarding his courage and\r\nhis willingness to attack men have very materially changed.\r\n\r\nIn passing over the elevated table-lands lying between the two forks of\r\nthe Platte River in 1858, I encountered a full-grown female grizzly\r\nbear, with two cubs, very quietly reposing upon the open prairie,\r\nseveral miles distant from any timber. This being the first opportunity\r\nthat had ever occurred to me for an encounter with the ursine monster,\r\nand being imbued with the most exalted notions of the beast's\r\nproclivities for offensive warfare, especially when in the presence of\r\nher offspring, it may very justly be imagined that I was rather more\r\nexcited than usual. I, however, determined to make the assault. I felt\r\nthe utmost confidence in my horse, as she was afraid of nothing; and,\r\nafter arranging every thing about my saddle and arms in good order, I\r\nadvanced to within about eighty yards before I was discovered by the\r\nbear, when she raised upon her haunches and gave me a scrutinizing\r\nexamination. I seized this opportune moment to fire, but missed my aim,\r\nand she started off, followed by her cubs at their utmost speed. After\r\nreloading my rifle, I pursued, and, on coming again within range,\r\ndelivered another shot, which struck the large bear in the fleshy part\r\nof the thigh, whereupon she set up a most distressing howl and\r\naccelerated her pace, leaving her cubs behind. After loading again I\r\ngave the spurs to my horse and resumed the chase, soon passing the\r\ncubs, who were making the most plaintive cries of distress. They were\r\nheard by the dam, but she gave no other heed to them than occasionally\r\nto halt for an instant, turn around, sit up on her posteriors, and give\r\na hasty look back; but, as soon as she saw me following her, she\r\ninvariably turned again and redoubled her speed. I pursued about four\r\nmiles and fired four balls into her before I succeeded in bringing her\r\nto the ground, and from the time I first saw her until her death-wound,\r\nnotwithstanding I was often very close upon her heels, she never came\r\nto bay or made the slightest demonstration of resistance. Her sole\r\npurpose seemed to be to make her escape, leaving her cubs in the most\r\ncowardly manner.\r\n\r\nUpon three other different occasions I met the mountain bears, and once\r\nthe cinnamon species, which is called the most formidable of all, and\r\nin none of these instances did they exhibit the slightest indication of\r\nanger or resistance, but invariably ran from me.\r\n\r\nSuch is my experience with this formidable monarch of the mountains. It\r\nis possible that if a man came suddenly upon the beast in a thicket,\r\nwhere it could have no previous warning, he might be attacked; but it\r\nis my opinion that if the bear gets _the wind_ or sight of a man at\r\nany considerable distance, it will endeavor to get away as soon as\r\npossible. I am so fully impressed with this idea that I shall hereafter\r\nhunt bear with a feeling of as much security as I would have in hunting\r\nthe buffalo.\r\n\r\nThe grizzly, like the black bear, hybernates in winter, and makes his\r\nappearance in the spring with his claws grown out long and very soft\r\nand tender; he is then poor, and unfit for food.\r\n\r\nI have heard a very curious fact stated by several old mountaineers\r\nregarding the mountain bears, which, of course, I can not vouch for,\r\nbut it is given by them with great apparent sincerity and candor. They\r\nassert that no instance has ever been known of a female bear having\r\nbeen killed in a state of pregnancy. This singular fact in the history\r\nof the animal seems most inexplicable to me, unless she remain\r\nconcealed in her brumal slumber until after she has been delivered of\r\nher cubs.\r\n\r\nI was told by an old Delaware Indian that when the bear has been\r\ntraveling against the wind and wishes to lie down, he always turns in\r\nan opposite direction, and goes some distance away from his first track\r\nbefore making his bed. If an enemy then comes upon his trail, his keen\r\nsense of smell will apprise him of the danger. The same Indian\r\nmentioned that when a bear had been pursued and sought shelter in a\r\ncave, he had often endeavored to eject him with smoke, but that the\r\nbear would advance to the mouth of the cave, where the fire was\r\nburning, and put it out with his paws, then retreat into the cave\r\nagain. This would indicate that Bruin is endowed with some glimpses of\r\nreason beyond the ordinary instincts of the brute creation in general,\r\nand, indeed, is capable of discerning the connection between cause and\r\neffect. Notwithstanding the extraordinary intelligence which this\r\nquadruped exhibits upon some occasions, upon others he shows himself to\r\nbe one of the most stupid brutes imaginable. For example, when he has\r\ntaken possession of a cavern, and the courageous hunter enters with a\r\ntorch and rifle, it is said he will, instead of forcibly ejecting the\r\nintruder, raise himself upon his haunches and cover his eyes with his\r\npaws, so as to exclude the light, apparently thinking that in this\r\nsituation he can not be seen. The hunter can then approach as close as\r\nhe pleases and shoot him down.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BIG-HORN.\r\n\r\nThe big-horn or mountain sheep, which has a body like the deer, with\r\nthe head of a sheep, surmounted by an enormous pair of short, heavy\r\nhorns, is found throughout the Rocky Mountains, and resorts to the most\r\ninaccessible peaks and to the wildest and least-frequented glens. It\r\nclambers over almost perpendicular cliffs with the greatest ease and\r\ncelerity, and skips from rock to rock, cropping the tender herbage that\r\ngrows upon them.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed by some that this animal leaps down from crag to\r\ncrag, lighting upon his horns, as an evidence of which it has been\r\nadvanced that the front part of the horns is often much battered. This\r\nI believe to be erroneous, as it is very common to see horns that have\r\nno bruises upon them.\r\n\r\nThe old mountaineers say they have often seen the bucks engaged in\r\ndesperate encounters with their huge horns, which, in striking\r\ntogether, made loud reports. This will account for the marks sometimes\r\nseen upon them.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the big-horn, when fat, is more tender, juicy, and\r\ndelicious than that of any other animal I know of, but it is a _bon\r\nbouche_ which will not grace the tables of our city epicures until a\r\nrailroad to the Rocky Mountains affords the means of transporting it to\r\na market a thousand miles distant from its haunts.\r\n\r\nIn its habits the mountain sheep greatly resembles the chamois of\r\nSwitzerland, and it is hunted in the same manner. The hunter traverses\r\nthe most inaccessible and broken localities, moving along with great\r\ncaution, as the least unusual noise causes them to flit away like a\r\nphantom, and they will be seen no more. The animal is gregarious, but\r\nit is seldom that more than eight or ten are found in a flock. When not\r\ngrazing they seek the sheltered sides of the mountains, and repose\r\namong the rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEEDLES.

B. MARCY, U.S.A.\r\n\r\nMiles.\r\n\r\n         Fort Smith to\r\n\r\n     65. South Fork of the Canadian.--The road from Fort Smith to the\r\n         South Fork of the Canadian follows the same track as the road\r\n         to Albuquerque and Santa Fe, and by reference to the tables of\r\n         distances for that road the intermediate camps will be found.\r\n\r\n     15. Prior's Store.--Grass, wood, and water near.\r\n\r\n 17-1/2. Little Boggy.--Good camp. Wherever there are not the requisites\r\n         of wood, water, and grass for encamping, it will be specially\r\n         noted; when they are not mentioned they will always be found.\r\n\r\n     13. Little Boggy.--Good camp.\r\n\r\n 15-1/2. Boggy Depot.--Store and blacksmith's shop.\r\n\r\n 12-3/5. Blue River.--The road passes over a flat section, which\r\n         is muddy after rains.\r\n\r\n  8-1/2. Fort Washita.--Good camp half a mile before reaching the fort.\r\n         The road forks at the Indian village on the Boggy, the left\r\n         being the most direct. There are settlers along the road, who\r\n         will give all necessary information to strangers. Corn plenty.\r\n\r\n     22. Preston Texas, on Red River.--The road from Fort Washita runs\r\n         through the Indian settlements, passing many places where good\r\n         camps may be found, and crosses the Red River at Preston. There\r\n         is a ferry here; also stores and a blacksmith's shop.\r\n\r\n     20. M'Carty's.--Road runs through a heavy-timbered country,\r\n         crossing several streams where there are good camps.\r\n\r\n 14-2/5. Elm Fork of the Trinity, at Gainesville.--Road passes over a\r\n         section diversified by prairies and groves of timber.\r\n\r\n     12. Elm Fork of Trinity.--Good camp.\r\n\r\n     11. Elm Fork of Trinity.--Excellent camps. Road passes over a\r\n         beautiful country rapidly settling up with farmers, who\r\n         cultivate and sell grain at low rates.\r\n\r\n      9. Turkey Creek.--Tributary of Red River. Road emerges from the\r\n         upper \"Cross Timbers\" two miles from camp.\r\n\r\n 26-3/4. Buffalo Springs.--Springs of good water, but of limited\r\n         amount, in a ravine.\r\n\r\n     12. On a Ravine.--Pools of good water and a small running stream,\r\n         not reliable.\r\n\r\n 13-1/2. On a Ravine.--Pools of water.\r\n\r\n 17-1/4. On a Ravine.--Pools of water.\r\n\r\n 17-1/4.

County seat\r\n         and town at Fort Belknap. Good camp on the west side of the\r\n         Brazos, which is always fordable except in very high water.\r\n\r\n     14. Small Branch.--Water in holes.\r\n\r\n     18. Water-holes.--Pools of water. Road passes over prairie and\r\n         timbered lands, is very smooth and level.\r\n\r\n  7-1/2. Stem's Farm, on Clear Fork of the Brazos River.--Good road;\r\n         excellent camp, with abundance of wood, water, and grass.\r\n         Indian reservation here.\r\n\r\n     13. Elm Creek, or Qua-qua-ho-no.--Good road over rolling prairie\r\n         and mesquite lands.\r\n\r\n     17. Ravine.--Pools of standing water. Good road.\r\n\r\n     18.

Laguna Colorado.--Water somewhat sulphurous; fuel mesquite\r\n         roots; grass abundant.\r\n\r\n     35. Mustang Pond.--This pond is north of the road about two\r\n         miles, and was found in 1849, but emigrants and others have\r\n         not been able to find it since. For this reason I would advise\r\n         travelers to fill their water-kegs at the Laguna Colorado, as\r\n         in a very dry season they might not be able to get any water\r\n         until they reach the Sand Hills. The road is excellent over\r\n         the \"Llano Estacado,\" or Staked Plain.\r\n\r\n 34-1/2. Sand Hills.--Water in holes. The water is good here, and can\r\n         always be relied on as permanent. The road through the Sand\r\n         Hills is very heavy, and I would advise travelers with loaded\r\n         wagons to make half loads.\r\n\r\n 31-1/2. Laguna near the Pecos River.--Road passes through the hills,\r\n         and descends the high prairie to the valley of the Pecos.\r\n         Laguna on the left.\r\n\r\n 15-5/8. Crossing of Pecos.--Water deep and not fordable; river 42\r\n         yards wide. A road leads up the eastern bank of the Pecos to\r\n         a ford with rock bottom. Good camps can be had at almost any\r\n         point on the Pecos. The water is brackish, but can be used\r\n         without harm.\r\n\r\n 54-1/2. Pecos River.--Point of the river where the road turns off\r\n         toward Delaware Creek.\r\n\r\n  9-1/8. Delaware Creek.--Good road after leaving the Pecos River.\r\n         The road on the Pecos is good in the bottom in very dry\r\n         weather, but after heavy rains it is submerged and very muddy.\r\n         Travelers should then turn off to the bluffs. The water in\r\n         Delaware Creek is brackish.\r\n\r\n 11-7/8. Ojo de San Martin.--Fine spring of fresh water, also mineral\r\n         spring. Good road up Delaware Creek.\r\n\r\n15-3/10.

Ojo del Camins.--Good spring in the pine timber at the base\r\n         of the mountain.\r\n\r\n  4-1/2. Peak of the Guadalupe.--Spring at the foot of the mountain.\r\n         Road descends the mountain, and is very steep.\r\n\r\n 23-7/8. Ojo del Cuerbo.--Road descends through a very rough and\r\n         sinuous ravine, and crosses a long prairie to camp at a\r\n         pond of standing water. No wood.\r\n\r\n     26. Cornudas (Wells).--Well in the rocks; plenty of water for\r\n         small parties. Road good.\r\n\r\n  8-3/4. Sierra del Alamo.--Road good; water limited in quantity.\r\n         There is a small spring upon the side of the\r\n         mountain. No wood except a few mesquite roots.\r\n\r\n 22-1/4. Waco Tanks.--Good water in a large reservoir in the rocks.\r\n         The road here branches, the left leading to El Paso and the\r\n         right to Dona Ana.\r\n\r\n     28. El Paso, on the Rio del Norte.--Road good, with some sand;\r\n         no water upon it.\r\n\r\n         The distance from the \"Waco Tanks\" to Dona Ana is 63 miles,\r\n         but 40 miles of the road is over heavy sand, and no water\r\n         until reaching the mountain, 25 miles from Dona Ana. I would\r\n         recommend travelers to take the El Paso road in preference.\r\n\r\nTotal distance from Fort Smith to El Paso, 860 miles.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nIV.--_From Leavenworth City to Great Salt Lake City._\r\n\r\nMiles.\r\n\r\n         Leavenworth City to\r\n\r\n      3.

Small Branch.--To the north of the road, in an arroya,\r\n         good wood, water, and grass. Here enters the road from\r\n         Atcheson, 6 miles distant.\r\n\r\n 16-2/3. Grasshopper Creek.--Good wood, water, and grass.\r\n\r\n  9-1/2. Walnut Creek.--Road passes a town called Whitehead, 4\r\n         miles from last camp.

Big Sandy.--Wood, water, and grass good.\r\n\r\n     19. Little Blue River.--Road runs across the hills without\r\n         water until reaching camp. Good wood, water, and grass.\r\n\r\n 18-3/4. Little Blue River.--Camp is at the point where the road\r\n         turns off from the creek. Good camps may be found any where\r\n         on the Little Blue, with excellent wood, water, and grass.\r\n         Fine running stream.\r\n\r\n     15.

South Platte River.--Road runs along the Platte, with no\r\n         timber. Good grass and water at any point, with buffalo-chips\r\n         for fuel.\r\n\r\n     17. South Platte River.--No timber all day. Good water and grass\r\n         at all points, with buffalo-chips.\r\n\r\n      8. South Platte Crossing.--No wood all day. Good water and\r\n         grass, with buffalo-chips. The river is about 600 yards wide,\r\n         rapid, with quicksand bottom, but can be forded when not above\r\n         a medium stage. It is best to send a footman ahead to\r\n         ascertain the depth of water before crossing the wagons and\r\n         animals.\r\n\r\n     19. Ash Hollow, at North Platte River.--Road leaves the South Fork\r\n         of the Platte, and strikes over the high prairie for 16 miles,\r\n         when it descends the high bluffs bordering the valley of the\r\n         North Platte, and enters Ash Hollow, where there is a plenty\r\n         of wood and a small spring of water. Half a mile beyond this\r\n         the road reaches the river. Mail station and a small grocery\r\n         here.\r\n\r\n 16-3/4. North Platte.--Very sandy road; no wood; grass and water\r\n         plenty at all points; buffalo-chips sufficient for cooking.\r\n\r\n     17. North Platte.--Road sandy in places; no wood; good grass\r\n         and water; some buffalo-chips.\r\n\r\n 16-1/2. North Platte.--Road good; no wood; good grass and water;\r\n         cattle-chips in places.\r\n\r\n 18-3/4. North Platte.--No wood. Camp opposite \"Chimney Rock,\"\r\n         which is a very peculiar formation on the south of the road,\r\n         and resembles a chimney. Grass good. Road muddy after rains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHIMNEY ROCK.]\r\n\r\n 17-1/2. North Platte.--No wood; grass and water good.\r\n\r\n     16. \"Horse Creek,\" branch of the North Platte.--In seven\r\n         miles the road passes through Scott's Bluffs, where there is\r\n         generally water in the first ravine about 200 yards below the\r\n         road. The road then descends the mountain, at the foot of\r\n         which is the Platte and a mail station. A little wood can be\r\n         obtained at Scott's Bluffs; there is none on Horse Creek.\r\n\r\n 14-1/4. North Platte.--Road follows the river bottom all day.\r\n         Wood, water, and grass on the river.\r\n\r\n     12. Fort Laramie.--Road rough and rocky in places. There are\r\n         wood and water plenty, and before many trains have passed the\r\n         grass is good above the fort. Mail station and post-office\r\n         here, with a sutler's store well stocked with such articles as\r\n         the traveler wants.\r\n\r\n     10. North Platte.--Road good, but hilly in places. Camp is in\r\n         the river bottom, with plenty of wood, water, and grass. Hot\r\n         spring two miles above here.\r\n\r\n     14. Bitter Creek.--There are two roads, both of which lead to\r\n         Salt Lake. The upper or south road is best in the spring or in\r\n         wet weather. I traveled the lower road. Wood, water, and grass\r\n         are good.\r\n\r\n 17-3/4. Horse-shoe Creek.--Fine camp, with excellent wood, water,\r\n         and grass. The road here forks, one passing to the left over\r\n         the hills, and the other running nearer the Platte.\r\n\r\n 20-1/2. North Platte River.--Good road along near the river. Good\r\n         wood, water, and grass. Road crosses the river at 12-1/2\r\n         miles.\r\n\r\n 20-1/4. North Platte River.--Road crosses the river again, and the\r\n         camp is two miles above the mouth of La Prell Creek. Good\r\n         wood, water, and grass.\r\n\r\n     19. North Platte River.--Road runs along the river, and is\r\n         smooth and good. The camp is two miles above the crossing of\r\n         Deer Creek, where there is a blacksmith's shop and store. Good\r\n         grass, wood, and water.\r\n\r\n     16. North Platte River.--Good road, with wood, water, and grass\r\n         at camp.\r\n\r\n     13. North Platte River.--Good road passing the bridge, where\r\n         there is a blacksmith's shop and store, also a military\r\n         station and a mail station. At two miles from camp the road\r\n         crosses the river on a good ford with rocky bottom. The wood,\r\n         water, and grass are abundant.\r\n\r\n     23. Red Buttes, on the North Platte.--Road is very hilly, and\r\n         in some places sandy; passes Willow Spring, where there is\r\n         grass and a little wood. Good wood, water, and grass at camp.\r\n         Mail station here.\r\n\r\n     11. Sweet Water Creek.--Road leaves the river at the Red Buttes,\r\n         and strikes over the high rolling prairie. Good grass and\r\n         water, but little wood at camp.\r\n\r\n     15. On Sweet Water Creek.--Road passes a blacksmith's shop and\r\n         store at the bridge six miles from camp, and at 2-1/2 miles\r\n         from the camp it passes the \"Devil's Gate\" and a mail station.\r\n         The Sweet Water here runs between two perpendicular cliffs,\r\n         presenting a most singular and striking appearance. Take wood\r\n         at the Gate for camp. Good grass and water at all places on\r\n         Sweet Water Creek.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DEVIL'S GATE.]\r\n\r\n     20. Sweet Water Creek.--Road muddy after rains, and some bad\r\n         ravines to cross. Wood, water, and grass of the best quality\r\n         at camp.\r\n\r\n     12. Sweet Water Creek.--Road runs along the valley of the Sweet\r\n         Water, where there is plenty of wood and grass in places, but\r\n         little wood at the camp noted.\r\n\r\n      8. On Sweet Water.--Road good; no wood; grass abundant.\r\n\r\n     20. On Sweet Water.--Road good; no wood.\r\n\r\n     17. Strawberry Creek.--Little wood; grass and water abundant.\r\n         Road leaves \"Sweet Water,\" and ascends a very long hill which\r\n         is very rocky.\r\n\r\n 20-1/4. South Pass.--Road crosses the dividing ridge, and strikes\r\n         the Pacific Spring, where there is excellent water and good\r\n         grass if many cattle have not passed, in which event the\r\n         traveler had better continue on down the creek which issues\r\n         from the spring. Sage for fuel; no wood.\r\n\r\n 15-3/4. Dry Sandy Creek.--Grass scarce; no wood; some sage and\r\n         greasewood; water brackish, but drinkable; road good. Here the\r\n         traveler should send ahead and have the best spots of grass\r\n         found, as it is very scarce throughout this section. Sublett's\r\n         Cut-off turns off here for Soda Springs and Fort Hall. Take\r\n         the left for Fort Bridger and Salt Lake City.\r\n\r\n     15. Little Sandy Creek.--Grass in spots along the creek bottom,\r\n         and some fuel.\r\n\r\n     18. Big Sandy Creek.--Grass in detached spots on the creek, and\r\n         little fuel.\r\n\r\n 21-1/2. Green River, Upper Ford.--Grass and fuel on the river.\r\n\r\n      7. Green River, at the Lower Ford.--Good grass and fuel below\r\n         the ford. Ferry in time of high water. Mail station and\r\n         grocery.\r\n\r\n     16. Black's Fork.--Good grass and fuel.\r\n\r\n      7. Ham's Fork.--United States bridge, no toll. Good grass\r\n         and fuel.\r\n\r\n     12. Black's Fork.--Road forks at the crossing of Black's Fork,\r\n         both roads leading to Fort Bridger. This itinerary is upon\r\n         the left-hand road, which crosses Black's Fork two miles\r\n         from Ham's Fork.\r\n\r\n     13. Smith's Fork.--Good camps along Black's Fork at any place,\r\n         but the road leaves the stream for several miles. Wood,\r\n         water, and grass at the confluence of Black's and Smith's\r\n         Forks.\r\n\r\n 18-1/4. Fort Bridger.--Good camps above and below the fort.\r\n         Military post, mail station, and store.\r\n\r\n         Muddy Creek.--Good grass, wood, and water. Grass short after\r\n         many trains have passed. It is then necessary to go up the\r\n         creek to find good grass. Road passes a fine spring 3 miles\r\n         back.\r\n\r\n     19. Bear River.--Good camps, with wood, water, and grass.\r\n\r\n         Good ford, except in very high water. Sulphur Creek two miles\r\n         back.\r\n\r\n     19. Red Fork.--In \"Echo Canon,\" two miles below Cashe Cave,\r\n         good grass and fuel; water plenty.\r\n\r\n 19-1/4. Weber River.--Good grass, wood, and water. Mail station.\r\n         United States bridge for high water; no toll.\r\n\r\n  5-1/4. Spring Branch.--Good camp. Road leaves the river, and takes\r\n         the left into a valley.\r\n\r\n      9. Bauchmin's Creek.--Road crosses over a mountain, and\r\n         descends to the creek, where there is a good camp.\r\n\r\n     14. Big Canon Creek.--Road crosses Bauchmin's Creek 13 times\r\n         in 8 miles, then ascends the mountain along a small creek,\r\n         which is well wooded and good grass.\r\n\r\n      6. Emigration Creek.--Road leaves Canon Creek, and crosses the\r\n         two mountains, which are very steep and long. Grass and wood\r\n         before crossing the \"Little Mountain.\"\r\n\r\n 10-1/4. Great Salt Lake City.--Forage can be purchased here, as well\r\n         as most of the articles the traveler may require, at high\r\n         prices. There is no camping-place within two miles of the\r\n         city. It is best for those who encamp with animals to cross\r\n         the Jordan River, or to stop near the mouth of the canon\r\n         before entering the city.\r\n\r\nTotal distance from Fort Leavenworth to Salt Lake City, 1168 miles.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nV.--_From Salt Lake City to Sacramento and Benicia, California._\r\n\r\nMiles.\r\n\r\n         From Salt Lake City to\r\n\r\n     18. Hait's Ranch.--Good road, and grass abundant until Bear\r\n         River is crossed.\r\n\r\n 17-1/4. Ford on Weber River.--Good road, and grass abundant.\r\n\r\n     15. Point of Mountain.--Spring water warm but pure.\r\n\r\n 12-3/4. Box Elder Creek.--Excellent water; grass and fuel\r\n         abundant in the canons.\r\n\r\n     23. Ferry on Bear River.--Four miles above the usual crossing.\r\n         Excellent grass.\r\n\r\n    3/4. West Bank.--Grass not good on the west bank.\r\n\r\n      6. Small Spring.--Cross Bear River below the mouth of the\r\n         Mallade.\r\n\r\n 17-1/2. Blue Springs.--Water and grass scarce, and of poor quality.\r\n\r\n 21-1/4. Deep Creek.--Heavy sage, but good grass on the right of the\r\n         road, near sink.\r\n\r\n 20-1/2. Cedar Springs.--Good grass on the hills, with fine water\r\n         and wood; rolling country.\r\n\r\n     10. Rock Creek.--Plenty of grass to the left of the road; good\r\n         camping-place.\r\n\r\n 14-1/2. Raft River.--Good camp.\r\n\r\n 22-1/2. Goose Creek Mountains.--Grass, wood, and water abundant;\r\n         rough and mountainous country. Road from Fort Bridger comes\r\n         in here _via_ Soda Springs.\r\n\r\n 17-3/4. On Goose Creek.--Rough, broken country, with a good road,\r\n         which runs along the creek for several miles.\r\n\r\n 28-1/2. Head of 1000 Spring Valley.--Road runs over a rolling,\r\n         barren section, with but little water except on the river\r\n         far to the right.\r\n\r\n 25-3/4. 1000 Spring Valley.--Meadow grass; good fuel scarce. Camps\r\n         can be found at short intervals along the road.\r\n\r\n     14. Head of Humboldt River.--Fine camping-places, and road\r\n         generally good, running over a rolling country.\r\n\r\n     23. Slough of the Humboldt.--Extensive bottoms of good grass.\r\n\r\n     20. Humboldt River.--Along the entire course of the Humboldt\r\n         good grass is found in the bottoms. The road, which follows\r\n         the bottom, is hard and smooth, but can not be traveled in\r\n         seasons of very high water, as the bottom overflows. It is\r\n         then necessary to take the road on the bluffs, where the grass\r\n         is scarce. The river, when not above a fording stage, can be\r\n         forded at almost any point, and good camps can be found at\r\n         short intervals. There are spots along the river bottom where\r\n         alkaline ponds are frequent. These are poisonous to cattle,\r\n         and should be avoided by travelers. It is well along this\r\n         river not to allow animals to drink any water except from the\r\n         river where it is running.\r\n\r\n     20. Humboldt River.--The foregoing remarks apply for every camp\r\n         on the Humboldt River.\r\n\r\n     22. Humboldt River.--Good camps along the Humboldt Valley.\r\n\r\n     23.

Lawson's Meadows.--The road here forks, the left going by\r\n         the Carson Valley and Sacramento route, and the right _via_\r\n         Goose, Clear, and Rhett lakes, Applegate's Pass of the Cascade\r\n         Mountains, into Rogue River Valley, Fort Law, Oregon\r\n         Territory, Yreka, Fort Jones, Fort Reading, and Sacramento\r\n         River.\r\n\r\n 33-1/2. On Humboldt River.--Grass and water poor all the distance\r\n         to the Sink of the Humboldt.\r\n\r\n 19-1/2. Sink of Humboldt River.--The water at the Sink is strongly\r\n         impregnated with alkali; the road generally is good. Travelers\r\n         should not allow their stock to drink too freely of this\r\n         water.\r\n\r\n     26. Head Sink of Humboldt.--Road good.\r\n\r\n     45. Carson River.--Road crosses the desert, where there is no\r\n         water for stock, but there is a well where travelers can\r\n         purchase water for drinking. This part of the road should be\r\n         traveled in the cool of the day and at night. Grass good, also\r\n         the water.\r\n\r\n      2. Carson River.--Good bunch-grass near the road.\r\n\r\n     30. Carson River.--26 miles of desert; poor grass.\r\n\r\n     14. Eagle Ranch.--Good grass and water.\r\n\r\n     13. Reese's Ranch.--Good grass and water.\r\n\r\n     12. Williams' Ranch.--Very good water and grass.\r\n\r\n     15. Hope Valley.--Road rough and rocky.\r\n\r\n      3. Near Sierra.--Good camp, with water and grass.\r\n\r\n      7. First Summit.--Road rough and rocky; good water; grass\r\n         scarce.\r\n\r\n      2. Second Summit.--Road mountainous and very steep; snow nearly\r\n         all the year.\r\n\r\n     10. Lakes.--Good camp.\r\n\r\n     12. Leek Springs.--Good grass near the road.\r\n\r\n     10. Trader's Creek.--Grass and fuel scarce.\r\n\r\n     12. Sly Park.--Grass and fuel near the road.\r\n\r\n         Forty Mile House.--Water plenty; grass scarce.\r\n\r\n         Sacramento Valley.--Water plenty; purchase forage.\r\n\r\n         Sacramento City.--Water plenty; purchase forage.\r\n\r\nTotal distance from Salt Lake City to Benicia, 973 miles.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nAt the Big Meadows, 23 miles from the Sink of the Humboldt, travelers\r\nshould make a halt of a day or two to rest and recruit their animals\r\nand to cut grass for crossing the desert, as this is the last\r\ngood camping-place until reaching Carson River. The ground near this\r\nplace is boggy, and animals should be watered with buckets. The\r\ncamping-ground here is on the right bank of the river, and about half a\r\nmile to the left of the main road. The water is in a slough, near its\r\nhead, where will be found some springs which run off a short distance,\r\nbut soon sink.\r\n\r\nThe road across the desert is very sandy, especially toward the western\r\nextremity. Twenty miles from the Sink of the Humboldt there are four\r\nwells. About half a mile east of the mail station the road leading to\r\nthe wells turns to the right, where water can be purchased for from one\r\nto two shillings for each man and beast.\r\n\r\nAt 9-1/2 miles beyond the mail station, on the desert, a road turns off\r\nfrom the main trace toward a very high sandy ridge, and directly upon\r\nthe top of this ridge is the crater of an extinct volcano, at the\r\nbottom of which is a salt lake. Upon the extreme north end of this lake\r\nwill be found a large spring of fresh water, sufficient for 1000\r\nanimals. From thence to \"Ragtown,\" on Carson River, is three miles.\r\n\r\nI would advise travelers, when their animals become exhausted before\r\nreaching this water, to take them out of harness and drive them to this\r\nplace to recruit. There is some grass around the lake.\r\n\r\nThis desert has always been the most difficult part of the journey to\r\nCalifornia, and more animals have probably been lost here than at any\r\nother place. The parts of wagons that are continually met with here\r\nshows this most incontestably.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nVI.--_From Great Salt Lake City to Los Angeles and San Francisco,\r\nCalifornia._\r\n\r\nMiles.\r\n\r\n         Salt Lake City to\r\n\r\n 20-5/8.

On Vegas.--Road runs up the river. Good grass.\r\n\r\n     17. Cottonwood Spring.--Poor grass.\r\n\r\n 29-3/4. Cottonwood Grove.--No grass. Water and grass can be found\r\n         four miles west by following the old Spanish trail to a\r\n         ravine, and thence to the left in the ravine one mile.\r\n\r\n 21-3/4.

It then ascends to the divide between Bear and Green\r\n         Rivers, probably 800 feet, in 1-3/5 miles. The descent on the\r\n         other side is about the same. The road passes many fine\r\n         springs. At one and two miles back it passes points of hills,\r\n         where it is very rough. Good grass and sage at camp.\r\n\r\n 8-9/10.

Bear River.--At 6-7/10 miles the road strikes a large\r\n         group of springs called \"Soda Springs,\" and here crosses Pine\r\n         Creek, on the left bank of which is a saleratus lake. Soon\r\n         after it strikes the main springs, and after crossing another\r\n         creek the \"Steam-boat Spring\" may be seen in the bed of the\r\n         river.\r\n\r\n     15. \"Port Neuf,\" or Rock Creek.--At 2-3/10 miles the road leaves\r\n         Bear River near where it runs through a canon with high bluffs\r\n         on each side. At this point the California and Fort Hall roads\r\n         separate. The California road (called Hudspeth's Cut-off) then\r\n         crosses a valley between the Bear River and Port Neuf River\r\n         Mountains, 9 miles. No water from camp to camp. Good camp.\r\n\r\n     15. Marsh Creek.--About two miles above the main road the creek\r\n         can be forded; a road leads to it from the descent into the\r\n         valley.

Small Creek.--The road ascends a ridge through a canon, and\r\n         descends to a valley on the other side. From the camp to the\r\n         summit of the ridge is 6-1/5 miles. The descent is 3-7/10\r\n         miles. It then crosses a valley 8 miles wide, and strikes a\r\n         canon which leads to the top of a hill over a rough road.\r\n         Plenty of wood, water, and grass at camp, but no water between\r\n         this and the last camp.\r\n\r\n  9-3/5. Small Creek.--Road after five miles strikes a canon with a\r\n         long but gentle ascent. Two miles from the entrance of this\r\n         canon is a spring branch. There is wood and some grass and\r\n         water at this place.\r\n\r\n 11-1/5. Spring Branch.--The road passes through a canon, and at 5\r\n         miles strikes the head of a spring branch, which it follows\r\n         down 2-1/2 miles to the junction with a larger branch, which\r\n         is bridged. At nine tenths of a mile another fork enters.\r\n         Grass very fine here. Road follows down this across the main\r\n         branch, and the camp is 2 miles below. Good camp.\r\n\r\n 18-1/2. Decassure Creek, or Raft River.--Road continues down the\r\n         creek 2-3/10 miles, and crosses, then ascends by a steep hill\r\n         to an elevated sage plain, leaving the creek at 11-4/5 miles,\r\n         and passes a slough with water. Good camp.\r\n\r\n 17-9/10. Spring Branch.--The road crosses the creek near the last\r\n         camp, and follows up a valley, crossing in five miles several\r\n         spring branches. At 2-9/10 miles it crosses the creek again,\r\n         and follows up the valley two miles farther, then crosses a\r\n         high sage plain 8-9/10 miles long, when it strikes a spring\r\n         150 yards to the left of the road, where there is an excellent\r\n         camp in a beautiful valley.\r\n\r\n     10. Junction of Salt Lake City Road.--Road passes several small\r\n         branches in 3 miles, then commences ascending through a canon\r\n         which, in 2-1/5 miles, leads to the entrance to the \"City of\r\n         Rocks,\" and passes through these for three miles. It then\r\n         crosses a ridge, leaving the City of Rocks, and at ten miles\r\n         from last camp intersects the road from \"Salt Lake City.\" At\r\n         1-2/5 miles beyond this a road leads off to the right to a\r\n         spring branch, 3 miles, where there is a good camp near the\r\n         foot of Goose Creek Mountain. From this point California\r\n         travelers can refer to the itinerary of the route from Salt\r\n         Lake City to Sacramento.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nVIII.--_From Soda Springs to the City of Rocks, known as Hudspeth's\r\nCut-off._\r\n\r\nMiles.\r\n\r\n         Soda Springs to\r\n\r\n      20.

The country\r\n         becomes more level, with grass every where. The road is muddy\r\n         in wet weather.\r\n\r\n 15-3/4. Cottonwood Creek.--Road continues over a prairie country,\r\n         sensibly rising and improving. Wood, water, and grass at\r\n         camp.\r\n\r\n     22. Turkey Creek.--The road is good, and at 18 miles passes\r\n         Little Turkey Creek. No wood, and the water poor at camp;\r\n         grass good.\r\n\r\n     23. Little Arkansas River.--The road runs over a level prairie,\r\n         and at 3-1/2 miles passes \"Big Turkey Creek,\" with the\r\n         Arkansas River Valley in sight all day. After rains there\r\n         are frequent pools of water along the road. Good camp.\r\n\r\n     20. \"Big Cow\" Creek.--The road passes for ten miles over a level\r\n         prairie, to Charez Creek, which is a bushy gully; thence six\r\n         miles to Little Cow Creek, which is a brushy stream, with\r\n         here and there a tree. Good camp here to the left of the\r\n         road, near a clump of trees. \"Prairie-dog towns\" commence\r\n         to be seen. Road very level. Buffalo-grass here.\r\n\r\n     20. Big Bend of the Arkansas.--The road at 12 miles strikes the\r\n         sand-hills of the Arkansas River. They are soon passed,\r\n         however, and the level river bottom is reached. The river\r\n         has a rapid current flowing over a quicksand bed. The road\r\n         is generally good from the last camp. Wood, water, and grass\r\n         at camp.\r\n\r\n      7. Walnut Creek.--The road is good. Cool springs at this camp;\r\n         good grass and wood.\r\n\r\n     21. Head of Coon Creek.--At five miles the road forks, one\r\n         following the river, the other a \"short cut\" \"dry route\"\r\n         to Fort Atkinson, where they unite on the river. The country\r\n         rises for ten miles on the dry route, then descends to the\r\n         river, and is covered with the short buffalo-grass. No wood\r\n         at camp.\r\n\r\n     18. Arkansas River.--The road passes over an undulating and\r\n         uninteresting prairie, with but little vegetation. The water\r\n         in dry weather is in pools.\r\n\r\n     19. Arkansas River, at Fort Atkinson.--The road runs over a\r\n         similar country to that of yesterday, with no wood near;\r\n         plenty of buffalo-chips for cooking, and good grass.\r\n\r\n 18-3/4. Arkansas River.--At 4-1/2 miles the road ascends a bluff\r\n         covered with thick buffalo-grass. On the river is heavy\r\n         bottom-grass. At 17 miles pass a ford. Grass good at camp.\r\n\r\n 19-1/4. Arkansas River.--The road is sandy for 14 miles, but not\r\n         deep except in places; thence to camp it is good. Good camp.\r\n\r\n     22. Arkansas River.--Country prairie, covered with short\r\n         buffalo-grass. Good camp.\r\n\r\n     22. Arkansas River.--The road is fine, crossing several dry-beds\r\n         of creeks, along which are seen a few scattering trees. Good\r\n         camp on a dry creek near the river.\r\n\r\n     24. Arkansas River.--The road runs over a barren plain at the\r\n         foot of the main plateau, and crosses two dry creeks near\r\n         the camp, on which are cottonwood-trees. Plenty of wood at\r\n         camp.\r\n\r\n     21. Arkansas River.--The road follows the base of the hills at\r\n         from one to three miles from the river. Good camp.\r\n\r\n     20. Arkansas River.--At seven miles the road strikes the \"Big\r\n         Timbers,\" where there is a large body of cottonwood; thence\r\n         for three miles the road is heavy sand. Good camps along\r\n         here.\r\n\r\n     13. Arkansas River.--At one mile the road passes some old houses\r\n         formerly used as a trading-post. Here terminates the \"Big\r\n         Timbers.\" Coarse grass at the camp.\r\n\r\n     15. Arkansas River.--At three miles the road passes the mouth of\r\n         Purgatoire Creek. Camp is below Bent's Fort. Good grass here.\r\n\r\n     24. Arkansas River.--Pass Bent's Fort. The grass is excellent in\r\n         the vicinity of the fort, but after this it is not so good.\r\n         The road runs over a high and considerably broken country.\r\n         Good camp.\r\n\r\n     11. Arkansas River.--Opposite the mouth of the Apishpa Creek;\r\n         good camp. The Huerfano Mountains and Spanish Peaks are in\r\n         sight from the camp. The \"Cherokee Trail\" comes in from\r\n         Arkansas near Bent's Fort, and leads to the gold diggings\r\n         at Cherry Creek.\r\n\r\n      9. Arkansas River.--Opposite the mouth of the Huerfano Creek.\r\n         Good camp, and a ford opposite Charles Audebee's house.\r\n\r\n     12. Arkansas River.--At this point the Cherokee trail bears to\r\n         the right and leaves the river. The left-hand, or river road,\r\n         runs up to the old pueblo at the mouth of the Fontaine qui\r\n         Bouille Creek. The right-hand road leads to the gold diggings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SANGRE DE CRISTO PASS.]\r\n\r\n 15-3/4. Fontaine qui Bouille.--The road strikes in a northwest\r\n         course over the rolling country, and comes upon the creek\r\n         at a most beautiful camp, where there is a great abundance\r\n         of good wood, water, and grass. The wood, water, and grass\r\n         are good at all points on the Fontaine qui Bouille, and\r\n         travelers can camp any where upon this stream.\r\n\r\n 17-1/2. Fontaine qui Bouille.--Here the road forks, one running\r\n         up the river, and the other striking directly across to the\r\n         divide of the Arkansas and Platte. I prefer the left-hand\r\n         road, as it has more water and better grass upon it.\r\n\r\n  6-1/2. Forks of the \"Fontaine qui Bouille.\"--The road to Cherry\r\n         Creek here leaves the \"Fontaine qui Bouille\" and bears to the\r\n         right. There is a large Indian trail which crosses the main\r\n         creek, and takes a northwest course toward \"Pike's Peak.\" By\r\n         going up this trail about two miles a mineral spring will be\r\n         found, which gives the stream its name of \"_The Fountain\r\n         that Boils_.\" This spring, or, rather, these springs, as\r\n         there are two, both of which boil up out of solid rock, are\r\n         among the greatest natural curiosities that I have ever seen.\r\n         The water is strongly impregnated with salts, but is\r\n         delightful to the taste, and somewhat similar to the\r\n         Congress-water. It will well compensate any one for the\r\n         trouble of visiting it.\r\n\r\n 17-1/2. Black Squirrel Creek.--This creek is near the crest of the\r\n         high divide between the Arkansas and Platte Rivers. It is a\r\n         small running branch, but always affords good water. There is\r\n         pine timber here, and the grass is good on the prairies to\r\n         the east. This is a locality which is very subject to severe\r\n         storms, and it was here that I encountered the most severe\r\n         snow-storm that I have ever known, on the first day of May,\r\n         1858. I would advise travelers to hasten past this spot as\r\n         rapidly as possible during the winter and spring months, as a\r\n         storm might prove very serious here.\r\n\r\n     14. Near the head of Cherry Creek.--The road crosses one small\r\n         branch at four miles from Black Squirrel Creek; it then takes\r\n         up to an elevated plateau, which in a rainy season is very\r\n         muddy. The camp is at the first timber that is found, near\r\n         the road, to the left. There is plenty of wood, water, and\r\n         grass here. There is also a good camping-place at the small\r\n         branch that is mentioned.\r\n\r\n     10. On Cherry Creek.--There is good grass, wood, and water\r\n         throughout the valley of Cherry Creek. The mountains are from\r\n         five to ten miles distant, on the left or west of the road,\r\n         and when I passed there was a great abundance of elk, deer,\r\n         antelope, bear, and turkeys throughout this section.\r\n\r\n      7. On Cherry Creek.--Good camp.\r\n\r\n     11. On Cherry Creek.--Good camp.\r\n\r\n     17. Mouth of Cherry Creek, at the South Platte.--Good camp, and\r\n         a town built up since I passed, called \"_Denver City_.\"\r\n\r\nTotal distance from Westport to the gold diggings, 685-1/4 miles.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nXVIII.--_From St. Paul's, Min., to Fort Wallah Wallah, Oregon._\r\n\r\nMiles.\r\n\r\n         St. Paul's to\r\n\r\n 17-1/4. Small Brook.--The wood, water, and grass are abundant as far\r\n         as the \"Bois des Sioux\" River.\r\n\r\n 20-1/4. Cow Creek.--This stream is crossed on a bridge.\r\n\r\n 23-1/4. Small Lake.--North of the road. The road passes over a\r\n         rolling prairie, and crosses Elk River on a bridge.\r\n\r\n     17.

Good camps.\r\n\r\n 19-1/2.-Little Blackfoot River.--The valley contracts so that wagons\r\n         will be forced to take the bed of the river in some places.\r\n         The river is fordable, and the trail crosses it five times\r\n         during the day.\r\n\r\n 22-1/2. Blackfoot River.--Sixteen miles from the last camp \"Blackfoot\"\r\n         and \"Hell Gate\" River's enter, and about one mile of this\r\n         distance is impassable for wagons; they would have to cross\r\n         the river, which is fordable. Good camps.\r\n\r\n 27-1/2. Fort Owen.--Road runs up the St. Mary's River to Fort Owen\r\n         over a broad, good trail in the valley.\r\n\r\n     40. St. Mary's River.--The south Nez Perces trail leaves the\r\n         main trail, which ascends the St. Mary's Valley to the Forks,\r\n         and follows the southwest fork to its source. To the Forks\r\n         the valley of the St. Mary's is open, and admits wagons.\r\n\r\n     24. Southwest Fork of St. Mary's River.--The road follows a\r\n         narrow trail, crossing the river frequently, and is not\r\n         passable for wagons. The valley is narrow, and shut in by\r\n         hills.\r\n\r\n  5-1/2.

There is no water at the\r\n         camp, but grass in an arroya.\r\n\r\n   9.00. Pai-Ute Creek.--This is a fine stream, with good water and\r\n         grass.\r\n\r\n  13.00. Arroyo.--Grass and wood; water is found by digging.\r\n\r\n   7.00. Fine Spring.--Good water and grass. The wagon-road passes\r\n         around the hills, but an Indian trail leads through the\r\n         ravine where the spring is.\r\n\r\n  19.00. Marl Spring.--This is a small but constant spring; excellent\r\n         grass, and greasewood for fuel.\r\n\r\n  30.00. Lake.--The road follows a ridge for some distance, then\r\n         descends to an arroyo, and in a few miles emerges into a\r\n         sandy plain, where there is the dry bed of a lake, which is\r\n         firm, and makes a smooth, good road. The camp is at some\r\n         marshy pools of water. Good grass, and greasewood for fuel.\r\n\r\n  12.00. Mojave River.--Road passes through a valley of drifted sand,\r\n         and at the camp strikes the river, which is here a beautiful\r\n         stream of fresh water, 10 to 12 feet wide and a foot deep,\r\n         with a hard, gravelly bottom. Grass in the hills near.\r\n\r\n  13.00. Mojave River.--The road ascends the river, the banks of which\r\n         are covered with fine grass and mesquite wood. Good camps\r\n         along here.\r\n\r\n  20.00. Mojave River.--The road leads up the river for a short\r\n         distance, when it turns into an arroyo, and ascends to a low\r\n         mesa, and continues along the border of a level prairie\r\n         covered with fine bunch-grass. It then enters the river\r\n         bottom again, which is here several miles wide, and well\r\n         wooded. Grass good.\r\n\r\n  20.00. Mojave River.--Six miles from camp the road strikes the Mormon\r\n         road, and crosses the stream near a Mormon camping-place. The\r\n         trail runs along the river, which gets larger and has more\r\n         timber on its banks as it is ascended. Good grass, wood, and\r\n         water.\r\n\r\n  22.00. Mojave River.--A short distance from camp the valley contracts,\r\n         but the road is good. It leaves the valley and crosses a\r\n         gravelly ridge, but enters it again. Good grass, wood, and\r\n         water.\r\n\r\n  15.00. Mojave River.--Road continues along the right bank of the\r\n         river, in a southwest course, and crosses the river at camp.\r\n         Good wood, water, and grass.\r\n\r\n  29.50. Cajou Creek.--The road leaves the river at the crossing, and\r\n         runs toward a break in the San Bernadino Mountains; it\r\n         ascends a sharp hill and enters a cedar thicket; it then\r\n         ascends to the summit of the Cajou Pass; thence over a spur\r\n         of the mountains into an arroyo or creek in a ravine; thence\r\n         along the dry channel of the Cajou Creek for two miles, where\r\n         the water begins to run, and from thence the road is rough to\r\n         camp.\r\n\r\n   7.00. Cajou Creek.--Road continues along the creek to camp, and is\r\n         rough. Wood, water, and grass at camp.\r\n\r\n  20.00. Cocomouga's Ranch.--On a pretty stream of running water. The\r\n         road runs for six miles down the Cajou Creek, along its steep\r\n         and rocky bed. It is here a good-sized stream. Captain\r\n         Whipple's road here leaves the San Bernadino road, and turns\r\n         to the west along the base of the mountains toward Los\r\n         Angeles; it then crosses a prairie and strikes the ranch of\r\n         Cocomouga. Wood, water, and grass.\r\n\r\n  24.00. Town of El Monte.--The road runs upon the northern border of\r\n         a basin which is watered by many small streams, and is\r\n         settled. The camp is on the pretty stream of San Gabriel,\r\n         where there is a good camping-place.\r\n\r\n  14.25. City of Los Angeles.--The road passes the Mission of San\r\n         Gabriel, then enters a ravine among hills and broken ground;\r\n         it then descends and crosses the river which waters the\r\n         valley, and enters the city. There is a good camp upon the\r\n         point of a ridge on the left bank of the river.\r\n\r\n  23.00.

Vasquez Fork.--Good road and fine camp.\r\n\r\n 19-1/2. Thompson's Fork.--Road crosses three creeks about five miles\r\n         apart, is good, and the camp is well supplied with water\r\n         and grass, but wood is scarce.\r\n\r\n 16-1/2. Bent's Fork.--Road crosses two streams about five miles\r\n         apart; no wood on the first. Good camp.\r\n\r\n     26. Cashe la Poudre River.--Excellent road crossing two streams\r\n         at ten and twenty-three miles from the last camp; good\r\n         camps on both. Cashe la Poudre is a fine large stream which\r\n         issues from the mountains near the road, and is difficult\r\n         to cross in high water. It has a firm bottom. Good camps\r\n         along this stream, with plenty of wood and grass.\r\n\r\n     16. Beaver Creek.--Road turns to the left and enters the hills,\r\n         ascending very gradually between two lines of bluffs, and\r\n         is good except in wet weather. Good camp.\r\n\r\n     19. Small Branch.--Road crosses Beaver Creek three times,\r\n         affording good camps. Road is hilly, but not very rough,\r\n         passing for a portion of the distance through a timbered\r\n         region. Elk and mountain sheep are abundant in this\r\n         section. The camp is near the summit of the divide. Grass\r\n         short.\r\n\r\n 17-1/2. Tributary of Laramie River.--Good road on the divide. Grass\r\n         and water plenty, but wood not abundant.\r\n\r\n 18-1/2. Tributary of Laramie River.--Road passes Laramie Fork three\r\n         miles from the last camp. Good camp.\r\n\r\n     21. Tributary of Laramie River.--Road crosses a small creek at\r\n         14 miles from last camp. Fine camp.\r\n\r\n     17. Medicine Bow Creek.--At twelve miles the road crosses\r\n         Sulphur Spring Creek, and at the West Fork of the Laramie\r\n         Lieutenant Bryan's road enters. At ten miles from the last\r\n         camp there are two roads--one, Bryan's, leading north of\r\n         the Medicine Bow Butte, and the other to the south of it.\r\n         The former is the best. Good camp.\r\n\r\n 17-1/2. Prairie Creek.--Fine camp. A portion of the road is very\r\n         rough. It crosses several small branches upon which good\r\n         camps may be had. Fine game section, with bear, elk, etc.,\r\n         in great abundance.\r\n\r\n 12-1/2. North Fork of the Platte.--Excellent camp. Leave Bryan's\r\n         road four miles back, taking the left, which is altogether\r\n         the best of the two. The crossing of the Platte is good\r\n         except in high water, when it is very rapid. A flat-boat\r\n         was left here by Colonel Loring's command in 1858.\r\n\r\n 12-1/2. Clear Creek.--Sage for fuel; grass short.\r\n\r\n     23. Dry Creek.--Road leaves Bryan's trail to Bridger's Pass,\r\n         and bears to the right, passing over a smooth country\r\n         covered with sage and poorly watered; passes a pond of\r\n         milky water at thirteen miles. There is water in Dry Creek\r\n         except in a very dry season. Two miles from the creek, on\r\n         the old trail, there is a fine spring on the left of the\r\n         road, which runs down into the road, and here is the best\r\n         grass after leaving the Platte, with plenty of fuel.\r\n\r\n 10-1/2. Muddy Creek.--Road leaves the old Cherokee trail at Dry\r\n         Creek, and bears to the left. Good camp for a limited\r\n         number of animals; fine grass along near the bank of the\r\n         creek. Bad crossing. Buffalo seen here.\r\n\r\n 19-1/2. Lake.--Old trail enters near this camp. Road passes a\r\n         brackish spring four miles back. The road may be shortened\r\n         by bearing to the left and skirting the hills for about six\r\n         miles before reaching the lake. The water in the lake is\r\n         not good, but drinkable, and will be abundant except in the\r\n         very dryest part of the summer. Grass is good on the hills.\r\n         The road from Dry Creek is shorter than the old road by 30\r\n         miles.\r\n\r\n 24-1/2. Red Lakes.--Road is good, but traverses a very dry and\r\n         sterile region. The water is not good in the lakes, but\r\n         drinkable, and may go dry in midsummer. Grass tolerable.\r\n\r\n     22. Seminoes Spring.--After passing the flats at the Red Lakes\r\n         the road is smooth and good, and there is a good camp at\r\n         Seminoes Spring.\r\n\r\n 12-1/2. Bitter Creek.--New road to the left, cutting off ten or\r\n         twelve miles. Good camp; water a little saline, but drinkable.\r\n\r\n     25. Sulphur Spring.--Road runs along the valley of Bitter Creek,\r\n         where there is but little grass until reaching camp.\r\n         Animals should be driven across the creek into the hills,\r\n         where the best grass is found.\r\n\r\n     17. Green River.--Road leaves Bitter Creek at Sulphur Spring,\r\n         and passes near, some high bluffs, where there are small\r\n         springs and good grass. Excellent camp at Green River. From\r\n         here the road runs over the same track as Bryan's road to\r\n         Fort Bridger. From all the information I have been able to\r\n         obtain regarding Lieutenant Bryan's road from Sage Creek\r\n         through Bridger's Pass, and thence down the Muddy Creek, I\r\n         am inclined to believe that the road we traveled is much\r\n         the best. It is said that Lieutenant Bryan's route from\r\n         Bridger's Pass to Green River has a scarcity of grass. The\r\n         water is brackish, and the supply limited, and may fail\r\n         altogether in a dry season. The road passes through deep\r\n         valleys and canons, crossing muddy creeks and deep ravines.\r\n         The creeks have been bridged and the ravines cut down so as\r\n         to form a practicable road; but freshets will probably\r\n         occur in the spring, which will destroy a great deal of the\r\n         work, and may render the road impassable.--_Lieutenant\r\n         Duane's Notes._\r\n\r\n         The other road is for the greater part of the distance\r\n         smooth, and has a sufficiency of grass in places, but the\r\n         water may become scarce in a very dry season.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nXXVI.--_From Nebraska City, on the Missouri, to Fort Kearney._\r\n\r\nNebraska City, on the Missouri River, is a point from whence a large\r\namount of the supplies for the army in Utah are sent, and one of the\r\ncontractors, Mr. Alexander Majors, speaks of this route in the\r\nfollowing terms: \"The military road from Fort Leavenworth crosses very\r\nmany tributaries of the Kansas River, the Soldier, the Grasshopper,\r\netc., etc., which are at all times difficult of passage. There are no\r\nbridges, or but few, and those of but little service. From Nebraska\r\nCity to Fort Kearney, which is a fixed point for the junction of all\r\nroads passing up the Platte, we have but one stream of any moment to\r\ncross. That one is Salt Creek, a stream which is now paved at a\r\nshallow ford with solid rock.\r\n\r\n\"There is no other stream which, even in a high freshet, would stop a\r\ntrain a single day. Again, upon this route we have an abundance of\r\ngood grazing every foot of the way to Fort Kearney. The route from\r\nNebraska City is about 100 miles shorter to Fort Kearney than that\r\nfrom Fort Leavenworth, the former being less than 200 miles and the\r\nlatter about 300 miles.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Nebraska City to Salt Creek is...... 40 miles.\r\nFrom Salt Creek to Elm Creek is.......... 60   \"\r\nFrom Elm Creek to Fort Kearney is........ 100  \"\r\n\r\nUpon the entire route there is an abundance of wood, water, and grass,\r\nand camping-places frequent.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nXXVII.--_From Camp Floyd, Utah, to Fort Union, New Mexico._ By\r\nColonel W. W. LORING, U.S.A.\r\n\r\nMiles.\r\n\r\n         Camp Floyd to\r\n\r\n     23. Goshen.--The road runs through Cedar Valley; is level and\r\n         good for 11 miles, to where the road forks. The left runs\r\n         near the lake, and has good camps upon it. Thence to a fine\r\n         spring, where there is a good camp, is 3 miles. Grass\r\n         continues good to the camp near Goshen. Wood, water, and\r\n         grass abundant.\r\n\r\n     14. Salt Creek.--Road runs over a mountain in a direct course to\r\n         a fine spring branch, which runs into Salt Creek at 3-1/2\r\n         miles, where is a good camp; thence through a meadow to a\r\n         small branch 3 miles, striking the old Mormon road again\r\n         opposite a mud fort, where there is a fine spring and good\r\n         camp; thence into the valley of Salt Creek, where there are\r\n         good camps.\r\n\r\n     18. Pleasant Creek.--Near the last camp the road forks, one\r\n         running to Nephi, a small Mormon village, the other to Salt\r\n         Creek Canon, which is the one to be taken. The road runs up\r\n         the canon 5 miles; thence up its small right-hand fork to a\r\n         spring, 3 miles; thence to camp. Good camps can be found any\r\n         where after crossing Salt Creek, with abundance of wood,\r\n         water, and grass.\r\n\r\n 19-1/2. Willow Creek.--Road at 6-1/2 miles passes a fine spring;\r\n         half a mile farther is another spring, where the road forks.\r\n         Take the right through a meadow; it is 3 or 4 miles shorter.\r\n         To the crossing is 3 miles; thence to the main road again 3\r\n         miles; to the village of Ephraim 5 miles. Good camp.\r\n\r\n     12. Lediniquint Creek.--At 6 miles pass Manti; thence to Salt\r\n         and Sulphur Springs is 3 miles. Good camp, with a fine\r\n         spring, wood, and grass.\r\n\r\n     15. Lediniquint Creek.--Road passes over a rugged country for 4\r\n         miles, to a creek; thence one mile it crosses another creek;\r\n         thence 2-1/2 miles up the creek, where there is a good camp.\r\n         The road improves, and for 8 or 9 miles camps can be found\r\n         by leaving the creek a short distance. The creek on which\r\n         the camp is muddy, with narrow channel.\r\n\r\n     18. Onapah Creek, or Salt Creek.--Road is good over a barren\r\n         country to the pointed red hills near the entrance to\r\n         Wasatch Pass, 7 miles. From the red hills cross Salt Creek 3\r\n         times in 4 miles; grass fair at 2d crossing; very good at 3d\r\n         crossing, and a good camp. Road rough for 3 miles after\r\n         leaving the creek. The road then enters a fine valley, with\r\n         plenty of blue and bunch grass. Road is level to within a\r\n         mile of the camp. Wood, water, and grass abundant at camp.\r\n\r\n  7-1/2. Head of Branch of Salt Creek.--Road runs over a ridge at\r\n         2 miles, thence one mile to a small branch. Grass abundant.\r\n         Road runs along the branch 3 miles; in places very rough,\r\n         with some sand; ascends the entire distance, and the camp is\r\n         very elevated. Good spring at camp.\r\n\r\n  5-3/4. Salt Creek.--Road passes over a ridge 2-1/2 miles to a\r\n         spring. Good camp at this spring. Colonel Loring worked the\r\n         road at this place. It crosses the creek 6 times within the\r\n         5-3/4 miles. Good camp, with abundance of wood, water, and\r\n         grass.\r\n\r\n  6-1/2. Silver Creek.--Road traverses a rolling section, is good,\r\n         passes several springs where there are good camps, and\r\n         crosses several trails which lead from California to New\r\n         Mexico.\r\n\r\n 17-1/2. Media Creek.--At two miles the road passes the dividing\r\n         ridge between the waters of Salt Lake and Green River;\r\n         thence two miles' descent to Shipley Creek, where is a good\r\n         camp. For about a mile the road is rough, but then descends\r\n         into an open plain where the road is good. The ground is\r\n         rough about the camp, and covered with sage and greasewood.\r\n         Two miles up the creek, near the canon, is some grass, but\r\n         it is not abundant here.\r\n\r\n 19-3/4. St. Raphael Creek.--Road passes a rolling section for 5\r\n         miles; thence 1-1/2 mile to Garamboyer Creek, where there is\r\n         a good camp; thence, with the exception of a short distance,\r\n         the road is good to the Knobs, 9 miles, when it is broken\r\n         for 4-1/2 miles. Good camp.\r\n\r\n 11-3/4. San Matio Creek.--For 3 miles the road is over a rolling\r\n         section, with steep hills, to a creek, where is a good camp;\r\n         thence, for 3 miles along the creek, soft soil and heavy\r\n         road; thence 5 miles to another creek, some grass, but not\r\n         plenty; thence to camp the road is rough in places. Good\r\n         camp.\r\n\r\n 14-1/4. In the Hills.--Road runs over a rolling country 2-1/2\r\n         miles to San Marcos, or Tanoje Creek, where there is good\r\n         grass and water, with sage. Two miles farther over a\r\n         gravelly road, then a good plain road for 9-3/4 miles to\r\n         camp. Good wood, water, and grass.\r\n\r\n     23. Spring.--Road for the first ten miles is rocky, when it\r\n         strikes a spring, where there is a good camp; thence 2 miles\r\n         to water in a tank, not permanent; thence the road is on a\r\n         ridge for 6 miles, and is good; thence 3 miles the road is\r\n         sandy. The spring at camp is large, with plenty of wood, but\r\n         the grass is scarce. Down the creek it is more abundant.\r\n\r\n     18. Green River.--For 5 miles the road is sandy; thence the road\r\n         is good for the remainder of the distance to camp, where\r\n         there is plenty of wood, water, and grass.\r\n\r\n     13. 13-Mile Spring.--Green River can be forded at ordinary\r\n         stages. Road runs among several arroyas for a few miles, and\r\n         is then straight and good to camp. Good grass a mile to the\r\n         east of camp.\r\n\r\n         An Arroya.--Road runs between two rocky buttes, and strikes\r\n         the Mormon trail, which leaves Green River at the same\r\n         place, but is very tortuous. Water not permanent here; good\r\n         grass three fourths of a mile from camp.\r\n\r\n 20-1/4. Cottonwood Creek.--Road passes over a broken country to a\r\n         water-hole, 9 miles; grass abundant; thence there is sand\r\n         in places: crosses several arroyas. Camp is between two\r\n         mountains. Wood, water, and grass abundant.\r\n\r\n     12. Grand River.--Road is over a rolling country; in places\r\n         light sand and heavy for wagons. Good camp.\r\n\r\n     13. Grand River.--Road is rolling and sandy. The Mormon road\r\n         runs nearer the mountains, and Colonel Loring thinks it is\r\n         better than the one he traveled. Good camp.\r\n\r\n 16-3/4. 1-1/2 mile from Grand River.--The first 3 miles is level,\r\n         then the road passes over a very elevated ridge, and\r\n         descends into the valley. Grand River runs through a canon,\r\n         and can not be reached with the animals. Road in places\r\n         sandy. Good camp.\r\n\r\n  9-1/2. Grand River.--At two miles strike Salt Creek, where the\r\n         Mormon road passes up a dry creek toward Gray Mountain. Road\r\n         skirts the mountains along Grand River, and is rough in\r\n         places, passing over abrupt hills. Good camp.\r\n\r\n 16-3/4. Grand River.--Road runs over a level and firm section, with\r\n         good camps at any point along the river. Cross the Mormon\r\n         and other trails. Good ford at the crossing except in high\r\n         water. Good camp.\r\n\r\n 18-1/2. On an Arroya.--Road runs over an undulating surface, crossing\r\n         several small streams issuing from Elk Mountain, affording\r\n         good camps at almost any place, and strikes Marcy's and\r\n         Gunnison's trails. Good camp.\r\n\r\n 15-1/4. Grand River.--Rolling country; high ridges with abrupt slopes\r\n         for 6-1/4 miles; thence into a plain for 7-1/4 miles to\r\n         Double Creek. Good camps.\r\n\r\n     12. Oncompagre River.--Good ford except in high water. At 6 miles\r\n         cross a dry creek; thence 3 miles over a high, level, and\r\n         firm road; strike a large trail; descend a hill with gentle\r\n         slope into the Valley of Oncompagre, where there are fine\r\n         camps. Winter resort for Ute Indians.\r\n\r\n 14-1/2. Oncompagre River.--Road runs along the valley of the\r\n         Oncompagre, is good, and camps may be found at any point,\r\n         with plenty of wood, water, and grass.\r\n\r\n     13. Cedar Creek.--Road leaves the Oncompagre, and bears to the\r\n         east up Cedar Creek to the gap in the mountains, 6 miles;\r\n         thence up the valley of Cedar Creek to camp, where are wood,\r\n         water, and grass. The Gap is the first opening in the\r\n         mountains above the mouth of the Oncompagre.\r\n\r\n  8-3/4. Devil's Creek.--Road runs to the head of Cedar Creek, over\r\n         the divide, into the valley of Devil's Creek, and is rough,\r\n         with a steep descent. Camp is near a narrow canon called\r\n         Devil's Gate, with high perpendicular bluffs. Good camp.\r\n\r\n      3. North Fork of Devil's Creek.--Road very rocky, and worked by\r\n         Colonel Loring. Marcy's and Gunnison's trails pass here. Good\r\n         camp.\r\n\r\n  7-3/4. Cebola Creek.--Road passes over abrupt hills covered with\r\n         pine. Good camp.\r\n\r\n  5-1/2. Ruidos Creek.--Road rough, with abrupt ascents and descents.\r\n         Fine creek 5 feet wide, and good camp.\r\n\r\n     13. Grand River.--Road rather smooth for the first 3 miles, then\r\n         rough and rocky, crossing several creeks, and descending\r\n         into the valley of the Grand or Eagle-tail River, where is a\r\n         good camp. Plenty of brook trout in all the streams in this\r\n         section.\r\n\r\n 14-1/2. Grand River.--Road crosses the river three times; bottom\r\n         wide; grass and wood abundant. Cross several beautiful\r\n         streams, upon which are good camps. Some sand and rough\r\n         places, but generally good road. Game and brook trout\r\n         abundant in this region. Indians resort to this section a\r\n         great deal.\r\n\r\n     18. Cutebetope Creek.--At about 5 miles the Cutebetope Creek\r\n         enters, forming at the confluence a beautiful valley, which\r\n         the road crosses, and strikes the creek near the Point of\r\n         Rocks, where the valley is only 40 yards wide, but after\r\n         passing the Point it opens again. The course of the creek is\r\n         nearly north. Good camps.\r\n\r\n     20. Spring near Beaver Creek.--Road crosses several small creeks,\r\n         where are good camping-places. Good camp.\r\n\r\n 16-3/4. Sawatch Creek.--Road runs over a very rough and mountainous\r\n         section for 14 miles to the summit of the Rocky Mountains;\r\n         thence it descends to camp, where grass, wood, and water are\r\n         abundant.\r\n\r\n 21-1/2. Sawatch Creek.--Road rough and rocky in places; strikes the\r\n         main Sawatch Creek at 9-1/2 miles; crosses numerous small\r\n         branches, where are grass, wood, and good water in abundance.\r\n\r\n 25-1/2. Camero Creek.--Road for 7 miles, to Sawatch Buttes, is good;\r\n         thence 1-1/2 mile to the last crossing of the Sawatch, where\r\n         is a good camping-place. Good camp at Camero Creek.\r\n\r\n  3-1/2. Garita Creek.--Good road and good camp.\r\n\r\n 16-1/2. Rio Grande.--Road level and good. Good camps along the\r\n         river at almost any point.\r\n\r\n      6. Rio Grande.--Good road and camp.\r\n\r\n 17-1/2. Fort Garland, Hay Camp.--Road continues down the river, and\r\n         is good. For six miles there is timber, but after this\r\n         willow is the only wood to camp. Good road. Hay is cut at\r\n         this place for Forts Massachusetts and Garland.\r\n\r\n     16. Culebra Creek.--At 4-3/4 miles cross Trinchera Creek, where\r\n         is a good camp. Road rather sandy. Good camps any where on\r\n         Culebra Creek.\r\n\r\n 24-3/4. Latos Creek.--Road tolerable to Costilla Creek, 10-3/4\r\n         miles. Good camp.\r\n\r\n     14. Ascequia, near Lama Creek.--Road crosses several small\r\n         branches. At 9-1/2 miles strike Red River. Grass at camp\r\n         good, but not abundant.\r\n\r\n 19-3/4. Meadow near Indian Puebla.--At 6 miles the road crosses\r\n         the San Christobal; thence over another ridge into the valley\r\n         of the Rio Hondo. Camp 2 miles from Taos.\r\n\r\n      2. Taos, New Mexico.--Good road. At Taos are several stores,\r\n         where goods of all descriptions can be had at fair prices.\r\n\r\n     13. Taos Creek Canon.--Road passes through the settlement, where\r\n         grain and vegetables can be obtained. It then enters the Taos\r\n         Canon at 3 miles, and crosses the Canon Creek frequently to\r\n         camp. Good camp.\r\n\r\n     29. Gaudelapepita.--At 5 miles the road ascends to the dividing\r\n         ridge, and is tolerable; thence in 4 miles cross the\r\n         mountain, and reach a fine spring branch, where is a fine\r\n         camp. Thence the road passes short ridges for 9 miles to\r\n         Black Lake. Good camp.\r\n\r\n         Fort Union.--Road follows Coyote Canon 3 miles; thence one\r\n         mile to Mexican settlement; thence 19-1/2 miles over the\r\n         prairie to the fort.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nColonel Loring came over the route from Camp Floyd to Fort Union with\r\na large train of wagons. He, however, found the road in many places\r\nupon the mountains very rough, and it will require working before it\r\nwill be suitable for general travel with loaded wagons. It is an\r\nexcellent route for summer travel with pack trains, and is well\r\nsupplied with the requisites for encamping.\r\n\r\nFrom Fort Union to Fort Garland the road passes through a settled\r\ncountry, where supplies of grain and vegetables can at all times be\r\npurchased at reasonable prices, and there are small towns met with\r\nduring almost every day's march where small shops supply such articles\r\nof merchandise as the traveler needs.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nXXVIII.--_Wagon-route from Guaymas, New Mexico, to Tubac, Arizona._\r\nFrom Captain STONE'S Journal.\r\n\r\nMiles.\r\n\r\n         Guaymas to\r\n\r\n 10-1/4. Rancho del Cavallo.--Good wood, water, and grass.\r\n\r\n      9. Rancho de la Noche Buena.--Good wood and grass, but no water\r\n         for animals in May and June.\r\n\r\n 19-5/8.

Hacienda de Alamito.--Plenty of running water, wood, grass,\r\n         and grain.\r\n\r\n      8. Hacienda de la Labor.--Plenty of running water, grass, and\r\n         grain.\r\n\r\n     28. Rancho de Tabique.--Roughest part of the road, but not\r\n         difficult for wagons. Wood, water, and grass. From\r\n         Hermosillo to this place there is water at short intervals\r\n         along the road.\r\n\r\n     36. Rancho Querebabi.--Wood and grass; water in tanks.\r\n\r\n     12. Barajita.--Small mining village. Bad water; good wood and\r\n         grass.\r\n\r\n     13. Santa Ana.--Village on the River San Ignacio. Plenty of\r\n         wood, water, and grass.\r\n\r\n     12. La Magdalena.--Thriving town, where all supplies can be\r\n         procured.\r\n\r\n      5. San Ignacio.--Village on the river. Good wood, water, and\r\n         grass.\r\n\r\n  6-3/4. Imuris.--Village on the river. Wood, water, and grass.\r\n\r\n 11-1/2. Los Alisos Rancho.--Wood, water, and grass.\r\n\r\n  3-1/2.

Tubac.--Silver mines at this place.\r\n\r\nTotal distance from Guaymas to Tubac, 295 miles.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--During the months of July, August, and September, water will be\r\nfound at almost any part of the road from La Casita to Hermosillo.\r\nThere is no lack of wood or grass on any part of the road from Guaymas\r\nto the frontier. The only difficulty in encamping at almost any point\r\nupon the road is that of obtaining water in the dry season, _i.e._,\r\nfrom February to the first of July. The remarks for each place apply\r\nto the most unfavorable seasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. _Portable Boat._\r\n\r\nA boat has been invented by Colonel R. C. Buchanan, of the army, which\r\nhas been used in several expeditions in Oregon and in Washington\r\nTerritory, and has been highly commended by several experienced\r\nofficers who have had the opportunity of giving its merits a practical\r\nservice test.\r\n\r\nIt consists of an exceedingly light framework of thin and narrow\r\nboards, in lengths suitable for packing, connected by hinges, the\r\ndifferent sections folding into so small a compass as to be\r\nconveniently carried upon mules. The frame is covered with a sheet of\r\nstout cotton canvas, or duck, secured to the gunwales with a cord\r\nrunning diagonally back and forth through eyelet-holes in the upper\r\nedge.\r\n\r\nWhen first placed in the water the boat leaks a little, but the canvas\r\nsoon swells so as to make it sufficiently tight for all practical\r\npurposes. The great advantage to be derived from the use of this boat\r\nis, that it is so compact and portable as to be admirably adapted to\r\nthe requirements of campaigning in a country where the streams are\r\nliable to rise above a fording stage, and where the allowance of\r\ntransportation is small.\r\n\r\nIt may be put together or taken apart and packed in a very few minutes,\r\nand one mule suffices to transport a boat, with all its appurtenances,\r\ncapable of sustaining ten men.\r\n\r\nShould the canvas become torn, it is easily repaired by putting on a\r\npatch, and it does not rot or crack like India-rubber or gutta-percha;\r\nmoreover, it is not affected by changes of climate or temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. _Winter Traveling._\r\n\r\nIn traveling through deep snow, horses will be found much better than\r\nmules, as the latter soon become discouraged, lie down, and refuse to\r\nput forth the least exertion, while the former will work as long as\r\ntheir strength holds out.\r\n\r\nWhen the snow is dry, and not deeper than 2-1/2 feet, horses in good\r\ncondition, will walk through it without much difficulty, and throw\r\naside the snow so as to open quite a track. If there are several horses\r\nthey should be changed frequently, as the labor upon the leading one is\r\nvery severe. When the snow is deeper than 2-1/2 feet, it becomes very\r\ndifficult for animals to wade through it, and they soon weary and give\r\nout. The best plan, under such circumstances (and it is the one I\r\nadopted in crossing the Rocky Mountains, where the snow was from two to\r\nfive feet upon the ground), is to place all the disposable men in\r\nadvance of the animals to break the track, requiring them to alternate\r\nfrom front to rear at regular intervals of time. In this manner a track\r\nis beaten over which animals pass with comparative ease.\r\n\r\nWhen the snow increases to about four feet, it is impossible for the\r\nleading men to walk erect through it, and two or three of them are\r\ncompelled to crawl upon their hands and knees, all being careful to\r\nplace their hands and feet in the same holes that have been made by\r\nthose in advance. This packs the snow so that it will sustain the\r\nothers walking erect, and after 20 or 30 have passed it becomes\r\nsufficiently firm to bear up the animals. This, of course, is an\r\nexceedingly laborious and slow process, but it is the only alternative\r\nwhen a party finds itself in the midst of very deep snows in a\r\nwilderness. Animals, in walking over such a track as has been\r\nmentioned, will soon acquire the habit of placing their feet in the\r\nholes that have been made by the men; and, indeed, if they lose the\r\nstep or miss the holes, they will fall down or sink to their bellies.\r\n\r\nEarly in the winter, when the snow first falls in the Rocky Mountains,\r\nit is so light and dry that snow-shoes can not be used to advantage. We\r\ntried the experiment when we crossed the mountains in December and\r\nJanuary, but found it impossible to walk upon them.\r\n\r\nShould a party, in a country where the snow is deep, have the\r\nmisfortune to lose its animals by freezing, the journey can not be\r\ncontinued for any great length of time without devising some method of\r\ntransporting subsistence besides that of carrying it upon the backs of\r\nthe men, as they are unable to break a track through deep snow when\r\nloaded down in this way.\r\n\r\nThe following plan has suggested itself to me as being the most\r\nfeasible, and it is the one I resolved to adopt in the event of losing\r\nour mules faster than we required them for subsistence when we passed\r\nthe Mountains.\r\n\r\nTake willow, or other flexible rods, and make long sleds, less in width\r\nthan the track, securing the cross-pieces with rawhide thongs. Skin the\r\nanimals, and cut the hides into pieces to fit the bottom of the sleds,\r\nand make them fast, with the hair on the upper side. Attach a raw-hide\r\nthong to the front for drawing it, and it is complete. In a very cold\r\nclimate the hide soon freezes, becomes very solid, and slips easily\r\nover the snow. The meat and other articles to be transported are then\r\nplaced upon the sled so as not to project over the sides, and lashed\r\nfirmly. Lieutenant Cresswell, who was detached from Captain M'Clure's\r\nship in the Arctic regions in 1853, says his men dragged 200 pounds\r\neach upon sledges over the ice. They could not, of course, pull as much\r\nover deep snow, but it is believed that they would have no difficulty\r\nin transporting half this amount, which would be sufficient to keep\r\nthem from starvation at least fifty days.\r\n\r\nI am quite confident that a party of men who find themselves involved\r\nin deep snows, dependent solely upon their own physical powers, and\r\nwithout beasts of burden, can prolong their lives for a greater time,\r\ntravel farther, and perform more labor by adopting the foregoing\r\nsuggestions than in any other way.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. _Indian Signals._\r\n\r\nWhen Indians are pursued by a large force, and do not intend to make\r\nresistance, they generally scatter as much as possible, in order to\r\nperplex and throw off those who follow their trail, but they have an\r\nunderstanding where they are to rendezvous in advance. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, circumstances may arise during a rapid flight making it\r\nnecessary for them to alter these plans, and turn their course in\r\nanother direction. When this happens, they are in the habit of leaving\r\nbehind them some well-understood signals to indicate to their friends\r\nin the rear the change in their-movements.\r\n\r\nFor instance, they will sometimes leave a stick or other object to\r\nattract attention, and under this bury an arrow pointing in the new\r\ndirection they intend to take. They will then continue on for a time in\r\nthe course they have been pursuing, until they get upon hard ground,\r\nwhere it is difficult to see their tracks, then gradually turn their\r\ncourse in the new direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH of the DIFFERENT ROADS.]",
