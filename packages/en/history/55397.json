This is illustrated by the subject of railroad reorganization.\r\nIn the years between 1893 and 1899 an imposing group of American\r\nrailroads passed into receivers’ hands. In 1893 alone more than 27,000\r\nmiles, with an aggregate capitalization of almost $2,000,000,000,\r\nwere taken over by the courts, and in the following years the amount\r\nwas largely increased. Foreclosure sales aggregated 10,446 miles in\r\n1895, 12,355 in 1896, and 40,503 between 1894 and 1898. Among the more\r\nimportant failures were those of the Richmond & West Point Terminal,\r\nthe Reading, the Erie, the Northern Pacific, the Atchison, and the\r\nBaltimore & Ohio;—to say nothing of the Norfolk & Western, the\r\nLouisville, New Albany & Chicago, the Ann Arbor, the Seattle, Lake\r\nShore & Eastern, the Pecos Valley, and many other smaller lines.\r\n\r\nThe railroads which failed between 1893 and 1898 were subsequently\r\nreorganized. In order to restore the equilibrium between income and\r\noutgo the companies turned to their creditors, and demanded the\r\nsurrender of a part of the rights of which bondholders were then\r\npossessed. This demand the creditors were forced to concede. Some\r\nof them yielded without legal compulsion, assenting to “voluntary\r\nreorganizations”; some insisted upon the sale of the property securing\r\ntheir loans, but without escaping the loss which fell upon their more\r\npliant associates. Much injustice to individuals came to light at this\r\ntime. Men who had invested in good faith were obliged to sacrifice\r\ntheir holdings through no fault of their own. The savings of years were\r\nswept away. The demand of the railroads was one, nevertheless, which\r\nthe courts supported, and rightly. The companies could not be operated\r\nunless the creditors were deprived of part of their legal rights. At\r\nthe same time, these rights no longer had a material basis on which to\r\nrest, and their surrender meant but the recognition of a loss which had\r\nalready taken place.\r\n\r\nMost of the reorganizations were completed by the year 1899. Since\r\nthat date the improvement in railroad earnings has been marvellous.\r\nGross earnings from operation were $1,300,000,000 in 1899, they were\r\n$2,300,000,000 in 1906, the last year for which the figures of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission are at present available. Total income,\r\nafter the deduction of operating expenses, was $605,000,000 in 1899,\r\nand $1,046,000,000 in 1906. It is not to be wondered at that the\r\ndistress of the years 1893–9 has not been duplicated during the years\r\n1900–7. On the contrary, weak roads have had opportunity to strengthen\r\ntheir positions, and strong ones have spent enormous sums for\r\nimprovements, and have declared liberal dividends besides. In no year\r\nsave 1905 has the new mileage put into receivers’ hands been greater\r\nthan 800 miles, and in but one has the mileage sold at foreclosure\r\nequalled that figure. Operating expenses have increased because the\r\namount of business has exceeded the ability of the railroads to handle\r\nit. Equipment has been so inadequate as to provoke drastic legislation\r\nby the legislatures of many states; yards and terminals have been\r\ncrowded until a prominent railroad officer has declared the expenditure\r\nof over five billion dollars to be necessary to restore the equilibrium\r\nbetween facilities and traffic.\r\n\r\nThese conditions have caused the earlier problems of failure and\r\nreorganization to be lost to view. Nevertheless, the financial panic\r\nof October, 1907, and the recession in activity which has become more\r\nand more apparent since that time, have again brought these problems\r\nforward. The Seaboard Air Line, one of the important railroad systems\r\nof the South, failed on January 5, 1908. The Chicago Great Western\r\nfollowed three days later. The Detroit, Toledo & Ironton, the Chicago,\r\nCincinnati & Louisville, the International & Great Northern, the\r\nWestern Maryland, and the Macon & Birmingham have since been put in\r\nreceivers’ hands. In all, the operation of 5938 miles of railroad,\r\nwith a capitalization of nearly $415,000,000, and total liabilities of\r\n$462,000,000, has been taken over by the courts during the first ten\r\nweeks of 1908. Whether this is but the beginning of still more extended\r\ntrouble it is of course impossible to say. There are a number of weak\r\nlines in the American railroad system, and the difficulty in obtaining\r\ncredit is bound to reveal weaknesses where they exist. At present new\r\nloans have for some months been difficult to obtain, and even strong\r\nrailroads have resorted to the issue of short time notes. The Erie,\r\nindeed, escaped bankruptcy on April 8, 1908, only through the timely\r\naid of important bankers who took up its maturing notes. This points\r\nto serious consequences for the weaker lines. It is true, on the other\r\nhand, that American railroads are generally in better financial and\r\nphysical condition than they were in 1893. It is not probable that any\r\nrailroad collapse will be so widespread now as it was then. Whether\r\nthis be so or not, the failure of nearly 6000 miles of railroad in ten\r\nweeks invests reorganization problems at present with an importance\r\nwhich they have not had for ten years. How, it will be asked, shall\r\nthe financial operations necessary to reorganization be performed?\r\nWhat methods shall be adopted, what dangers avoided, and what results\r\nexpected?\r\n\r\nThe experience of earlier years will provide answers to many of the\r\nquestions asked in 1908. In the hope, therefore, that a study of\r\nrailroad reorganization, on which the author has been intermittently\r\nengaged during the last six years, will prove of service, the following\r\npages have been published. They discuss in some detail the financial\r\nhistory of the seven most important railroads which failed from 1892–6,\r\nand that of one railroad, the Rock Island, which was reorganized in\r\n1902; and summarize in a final chapter the characteristics of the\r\nvarious reorganizations in which these roads have become involved.\r\nIn some respects the history of each road considered is peculiar\r\nunto itself. The Reading had coal to sell, the Atchison did not. The\r\nSouthern ran through a sparsely settled country, the Baltimore & Ohio\r\nthrough a thickly settled one. The Erie has never recovered from the\r\ncampaigns of Gould, Drew, and Fisk from 1864–72, the Northern Pacific\r\nwas not opened until 1883. In other respects, however, the roads have\r\nhad much in common. Excepting only the Rock Island, each of them has\r\nfound itself at one time or another unable to pay its debts, and has\r\nhad to seek measures of relief. The problems of the different companies\r\nat these times have been strikingly alike. However caused, their\r\nfinancial difficulties have been expressed in high fixed charges, and,\r\nusually, in excessive floating debts. Greater annual obligations have\r\nbeen assumed than the roads could meet, and current liabilities have\r\naccumulated while pressing demands have been satisfied. To this state\r\nof affairs the remedy has been sought in comprehensive exchanges of old\r\nsecurities for new. The exchanges, it is true, have been carried out\r\nin different ways, and the collateral expedients employed have not been\r\nthe same. To similar problems different solutions have been applied.\r\nIt is possible, for this very reason, for a careful study of the\r\nalternative reorganization methods which have been developed to point\r\nout some policies which have been dangerous, and to make clear others\r\nwhich are both just, and likely to be successful. Such a study also\r\nthrows light upon the history of the companies upon which it is based.\r\n\r\nFor the way in which the different roads have been handled, the\r\nreader is referred to the text. The order of treatment is very\r\nroughly determined by geographical location; that is, the Eastern\r\nroads are first considered, then the Southern, and then the Western.\r\nEach chapter, except the last, should be examined as a “case” in\r\nreorganization experience, and as part, therefore, of a united whole.\r\nNo one has been so continuously with his work as the author himself,\r\nand no one can more keenly realize its defects. It is offered as a\r\ncontribution in a field in which very little has as yet been done,\r\nand it is hoped that it will prove of value to those concerned with\r\nreorganization plans, as well as to those interested in the development\r\nof corporation finance during the last generation.\r\n\r\nWithout the unselfish and intelligent assistance of the writer’s\r\nMother, the preparation of this book would have been long delayed. To\r\nher, first of all, thanks are due. To Professor William Z. Ripley, of\r\nHarvard University, should be made warm acknowledgment of his constant\r\ninterest and helpful suggestions. To the Carnegie Institution the\r\nauthor is indebted for grants in aid of research in this special field.\r\nGrateful acknowledgment should also be made of gifts by friends of the\r\nUniversity to cover the expenses of publication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n  BALTIMORE & OHIO 1\r\n\r\n  Early history—Extension to Chicago—Trunk-line rate wars—Effect on\r\n    the company—Extension to New York—Sale of bonds to pay off floating\r\n    debt—Unsatisfactory traffic conditions—Receivership—Mr. Little’s\r\n    report—Reorganization—Subsequent history.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n  ERIE 34\r\n\r\n  Early history—Reorganization—Wall Street struggles—Financial\r\n    difficulties—Second reorganization—Development of coal business\r\n    —Extension to Chicago—Grant & Ward—Financial readjustment—New\r\n    York, Pennsylvania & Ohio—Third reorganization—Later history.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n  PHILADELPHIA & READING 75\r\n\r\n  Early history—Purchase of coal lands—Funding of floating debt—\r\n    Failure—Struggles between Gowen and his opponents—Reorganization—\r\n    Second failure and reorganization.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n  PHILADELPHIA & READING 118\r\n\r\n  Difficulties of the Coal & Iron Company—McLeod’s policy of extension—\r\n    Collapse of this policy—Failure of company—Summary of subsequent\r\n    history.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n  THE SOUTHERN 146\r\n\r\n  Richmond & Danville—East Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia—Formation\r\n    of the Southern Railway Security Company—Growth and combinations—\r\n    Failure and reorganization of the East Tennessee—Reversal of\r\n    position between the Richmond & Danville and the Richmond & West\r\n    Point Terminal—Acquisition of the Central of Georgia—Failure and\r\n    reorganization of the whole system—Subsequent development.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n  ATCHISON, TOPEKA & SANTA FE 192\r\n\r\n  Charter—Strategic extensions—Competitive extensions—Effect\r\n    on finances—Raise in rate of dividend—Reorganization of\r\n    1889—Acquisition of the St. Louis & San Francisco and of the\r\n    Colorado Midland—Income bond conversion—Receivership—English\r\n    reorganization plan—Mr. Little’s report—Final reorganization plan—\r\n    Sale—Subsequent history.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n  UNION PACIFIC 220\r\n\r\n  Acts of 1862 and 1864—High cost of construction—Forced combination\r\n    with the Kansas Pacific and the Denver Pacific—Unprofitable branches\r\n    —Adams’s administration—Financial difficulties—Debt to the\r\n    Government—Receivership and reorganization—Later history.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n  NORTHERN PACIFIC 263\r\n\r\n  Act of 1864—Failure and reorganization—Extension into the Northwest—\r\n    Villard and the Oregon & Transcontinental Company—Lack of prosperity\r\n    —Refunding mortgage—Lease of Wisconsin Central—Financial\r\n    difficulties—Receivership—Legal complications—Reorganization—\r\n    Subsequent history.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n  ROCK ISLAND 311\r\n\r\n  Charter—Early prosperity—Reorganization of 1880—Conservative policy\r\n    —Extension—Pays dividends throughout the nineties—Moores obtain\r\n    control—Reorganization of 1902—Further extensions—Impaired credit\r\n    of the company.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n  CONCLUSION 334\r\n\r\n  Definition of railroad reorganization—Causes of the financial\r\n    difficulties of railroads—Unrestricted capitalization and\r\n    unrestricted competition—Problem of cash requirements—Problem of\r\n    fixed charges—Distribution of losses—Capitalization before and\r\n    after—Value of securities before and after—Provision for future\r\n    capital requirements—Voting trusts—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAILROAD REORGANIZATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nBALTIMORE & OHIO\r\n\r\n  Early history—Extension to Chicago—Trunk-line rate wars—Effect\r\n    on the company—Extension to New York—Sale of bonds to pay off\r\n    floating debt—Unsatisfactory traffic conditions—Receivership—\r\n    Mr. Little’s report—Reorganization—Subsequent history.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Baltimore & Ohio Railroad was the first important railway company\r\nto be incorporated in the United States. It was designed to aid the\r\ncity of Baltimore in securing the Western trade, and not only private\r\ncitizens but the city of Baltimore and the state of Maryland early\r\nsubscribed to its stock. When in the course of construction it became\r\nexpedient to extend into Virginia, the city of Wheeling and the state\r\nof Virginia likewise subscribed, though the action of the latter was\r\nsubsequently withdrawn.[1] As a result the funds required for first\r\nconstruction were obtained from the sale of stocks instead of bonds.\r\nIn 1844, seventeen years after the granting of the charter, the annual\r\nreport showed $7,000,000 in stock as against $985,000 in 6 per cent\r\nbonds; while in 1849, though the loans had been increased, they yet\r\nstood in the proportion of one to two.[2]\r\n\r\nOn December 1, 1831, the first train was run over the line, then 72½\r\nmiles in length.[3] The early history of the road does not much concern\r\nus. It was one of steady growth, not through an unsettled territory,\r\nas with our Western roads, but through a country the industries of\r\nwhich were already established. Tracks led, not into prairies, but\r\nto populous cities; and the future of the company, once the initial\r\ndifficulties should have been overcome, was at no time uncertain. Thus\r\nextension to Cumberland increased the gross receipts from $426,492\r\nto $575,235, and that to Wheeling in 1853 likewise brought a great\r\nincrease in traffic.\r\n\r\nThe Civil War bore upon the Baltimore & Ohio heavily because of the\r\npeculiar location of its mileage. On May 28, 1861, possession was\r\ntaken by the Confederates of more than one hundred miles of the main\r\nstem, embracing chiefly the region between the Point of Rocks and\r\nCumberland.[4] Government protection was temporarily restored in 1862,\r\nbut raids occurred until the end of the war. Each time the Confederates\r\noccupied the line they tore it up, and as soon as they retired the\r\ncompany hastened to make repairs. The road did not default. A portion\r\nof the track yielded a revenue from first to last, and presumably the\r\nGovernment paid generously for the transportation of its troops.\r\n\r\nIt was after the Civil War that the real history of the road began. The\r\nkey-note was competition;—competition of the fiercest sort between\r\nparallel lines from Chicago to the seaboard, intensified by the rivalry\r\nof the great seaboard cities, and involving traffic in both directions.\r\nThe decade 1850–60 had seen the extension of Eastern roads to Western\r\nconnections. In 1851 the Erie had reached Lake Erie; in 1853 the New\r\nYork Central and Lake Shore, and in 1855 the Pennsylvania and Fort\r\nWayne had opened continuous routes from the Atlantic to Chicago. In\r\n1857 the Baltimore & Ohio had obtained connection with Cincinnati\r\nand St. Louis; and in 1858 the Grand Trunk had arrived at Sarnia on\r\nits way from Portland to Chicago. After the Civil War there was both\r\nconsolidation and extension. The New York Central was united with the\r\nHudson River, and the Pennsylvania leased the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne\r\n& Chicago in 1869. The Baltimore & Ohio reached Chicago in 1874, and\r\nthe lines which in April, 1880, were consolidated into the Chicago &\r\nGrand Trunk were completed between Port Huron and Chicago in February\r\nof that year. The completion of these through routes opened the way for\r\nvery bitter competition. Five independent lines struggled for Chicago\r\nbusiness, and all of them were prepared to cut rates deeply in order\r\nto test their rivals’ strength. In particular the Baltimore & Ohio was\r\naggressive. “At the time of its [Chicago branch] opening,” said Mr.\r\nBlanchard before the Hepburn Committee, “it was heralded all over the\r\nNorthwest as a ‘Relief for the Farmer,’ ‘the Grangers’ Friend,’ and all\r\nother sorts of headlines were put into the Chicago and Northwestern\r\npapers; and President Garrett’s public utterances, and those to his\r\nBoard, were filled with enough statements to show what he intended to\r\ndo.... I heard him [say] that upon the completion of his lines, like\r\nanother Samson, he could pull down the temple of rates upon the heads\r\nof these other trunk lines.”[5]\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances a dispute between the Baltimore & Ohio and\r\nthe Pennsylvania in 1874 over the former’s connection with New York\r\nhad far-reaching consequences.[6] The Pennsylvania refused to carry\r\nBaltimore & Ohio cars over its line north from Philadelphia, and as a\r\nretaliatory measure the Baltimore & Ohio reduced passenger fares from\r\nWashington and Baltimore to Western points from 25 to 40 per cent.[7]\r\nThe reduction in rates thus begun inaugurated the first of the great\r\nrailroad wars. The cuts soon extended to east-bound passengers and to\r\nfreight, and forced corresponding cuts on the Pennsylvania, the Lake\r\nShore & Michigan Southern, the Michigan Central, the New York Central,\r\nand the Erie. Rates on fourth class and grain from Chicago to New\r\nYork, which had been 60 cents per 100 pounds in December, 1873, and\r\n40 cents in December, 1874, fell to 30 cents in March, 1875. Rates on\r\nspecial, or sixth class,[8] went as low as 12 cents from Baltimore and\r\nPhiladelphia to Chicago. Passenger fares from Chicago to Baltimore and\r\nWashington were reduced from $19 to $9, to Philadelphia from $19 to\r\n$12, to New York from $22 to $15, and to Boston from $22 to $15. The\r\nNew York Central and the Erie quoted fares from New York to Chicago\r\nof $18 and to St. Louis of $20, and the Baltimore & Ohio replied by\r\na cut to $16.25 to Chicago. In April, 1875, the Baltimore & Ohio cut\r\nfreight rates from Cumberland to Baltimore over 50 per cent on the four\r\nregular classes, and the Pennsylvania at once announced still greater\r\nreductions.[9]\r\n\r\nThe effect of this warfare on railroad revenues was sufficiently\r\nserious to cause the Baltimore & Ohio to recede somewhat from\r\nits independent position and to enter into negotiations with the\r\nPennsylvania;[10] but the terms of the resulting agreement proved\r\nunsatisfactory to the other trunk lines, and no general pacification\r\nwas obtained. Late in 1875 rates nevertheless generally advanced,\r\nand in December a general agreement was concluded, followed by a\r\ngeneral increase. This agreement was again hopelessly disrupted by the\r\nfollowing April, when cuts in east-bound rates followed each other with\r\nrapidity. The published rates on grain, which had been 45 cents at the\r\nbeginning of March, 1876, fell to 40 cents on March 7, 35 cents on\r\nApril 13, 22½ cents on April 25, and 20 cents on May 5. In June rates\r\non west-bound freight fell to 25 cents first class to Chicago, and 16\r\ncents fourth and fifth class, actual rates going much lower; and it\r\nwas possible to travel from New York to Chicago first class for $13.[11]\r\n\r\nWarfare between railroads became intensified by the competition between\r\nthe cities which the railroads served, and by 1876 the question of\r\nrelative rates to New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore had grown to be\r\nof primary importance.[12] By an agreement in 1869 Baltimore had been\r\ngiven a differential on east-bound freight of 10 cents per 100 pounds,\r\nwhich had been reduced to 5 cents on grain in 1870. On west-bound\r\nfreight Baltimore had enjoyed a differential in 1875 which had ranged\r\nfrom 10 cents on first class to 5 cents on special class freight, and\r\nPhiladelphia one which had been 2 cents less except on first class,\r\nwhere the Philadelphia differential had been 3 cents less than that to\r\nBaltimore. A temporary agreement of March, 1876, had replaced these\r\nallowances by differentials of 13 per cent in favor of Baltimore and 10\r\nper cent in favor of Philadelphia as against New York. This relation\r\nwas fought over in the rate war of 1876. In December of that year\r\nanother agreement was reached on the basis of equal rates from Western\r\npoints to Europe on export traffic via all four competing seaboard\r\ncities, and reduced percentage differentials on local traffic to those\r\ncities; but this proved temporary, the subsequent advances in rates\r\nwere not general, and final agreement was not secured until April,\r\n1877. The contract then executed was in the nature of a compromise.\r\nThe differential to Baltimore was reduced from 13 per cent to 3 cents,\r\nand from Philadelphia from 10 per cent to 2 cents, to apply equally\r\nto local and to export traffic. Rates to Boston were at no time to be\r\nless than those to New York. Differentials on west-bound traffic were\r\nto be the same as those on east-bound on third class, fourth class, and\r\nspecial freight, and on first and second classes to be 8 cents less per\r\nhundred from Baltimore and 6 cents less from Philadelphia than from New\r\nYork.[13]\r\n\r\nThe years following the agreement of 1877 were marked by low and\r\nfluctuating rates, extensive cutting under the published schedules,\r\nand frequent attempts at pooling and at apportionment of traffic. At a\r\nmeeting at Chicago on December 19, 1878, tariff rates were agreed upon\r\nby all lines, but the existence of time contracts depressed receipts\r\nfor months thereafter. Another meeting on May 8 was followed by sharp\r\ncompetition. In June an agreement to raise rates was made, but proved\r\nunsatisfactory owing to long time contracts. “During the period between\r\nDecember 18, 1878, and July 5, 1879,” said Mr. King in a letter to the\r\nTrunk-Line Arbitrators on July 17, 1879, “the Baltimore & Ohio Company\r\nhas practically been out of the market, on account of the low rates by\r\nthe Northern lines. It has not secured enough east-bound freight to\r\ngive return loads for the small west-bound traffic sent over its lines\r\nto that city, and has repeatedly moved its cars empty from Chicago to\r\nother points on its lines east of that city.”[14]\r\n\r\nEarly in 1881 the cutting of rates became sufficiently important to\r\nforce official recognition by the chairman of the trunk-line pool.[15]\r\nBy June 17 quoted rates on grain were 15 cents per 100 pounds from\r\nChicago to New York, and a railroad war was in full swing.[16] By\r\nOctober the grain rate had been reduced from 15 cents to 12½ cents;\r\nby August passenger fares were $7 from New York to Chicago, and $16\r\nfrom Chicago to New York, and there was quoted besides a $5 Boston to\r\nChicago rate over the Grand Trunk. The radical nature of these cuts can\r\nbe appreciated from Mr. Albert Fink’s testimony before the Hepburn\r\nand Cullom Committees. Fifteen cents, said he in 1879, just covered\r\nthe actual cost of hauling the grain;[17] twenty cents, he asserted in\r\n1885, was the bare cost of movement, including the general expenses,\r\nbut without any profit to the road.[18] Grain was therefore not\r\nrepaying the specific cost of hauling, and passengers were obviously\r\nin similar case. Temporary relief occurred through the large increase\r\nin business which took place at the end of 1881. In October the\r\nPennsylvania and the Baltimore & Ohio advanced east-bound rates because\r\nof the abundance of traffic offering, and the New York Central, Erie,\r\nand Grand Trunk followed to a less degree. In November further advances\r\noccurred, though west-bound rates remained low; but throughout December\r\nand January rates were low and fluctuating,[19] and negotiations were\r\ncarried on for the settlement of the differential question which\r\nunderlay the trouble. None of the combatants were open to conviction;\r\nthe only outlet was therefore arbitration, and this was reluctantly\r\nresorted to.[20] In January, 1882, the roads divided the through\r\ntrunk-line business, agreed to raise rates, and left the subject of\r\ndifferentials to be investigated by Messrs. Thurman, Washburn, and\r\nCooley.[21]\r\n\r\nThis solution settled nothing. During the following three years\r\nconstant disputes arose over the proper division of traffic,[22] and\r\nin 1884 the old struggle was resumed with unabated vigor. Rates on\r\ngrain to the seaboard fell from 30 cents to 20 cents on March 14 of\r\nthat year, and to 15 cents on March 21; remaining low and fluctuating\r\nthrough the year.[23] Immigrant business from New York to Chicago was\r\nhandled by the Pennsylvania at one dollar a head. By February, 1885,\r\nrates for traffic in both directions were completely demoralized.\r\nNominal east-bound charges on grain were 25 cents, or a 10 cent advance\r\nsince the preceding March, but actual rates were as low as 8 and 10\r\ncents. Meanwhile published rates on west-bound freight were a third\r\nless than the standard tariff, and passenger rates in both directions\r\nwere, roughly, one-half the regular charges. The following month still\r\nfurther reductions occurred. The warfare was finally terminated by an\r\nagreement to maintain rates late in 1885,[24] followed by an elaborate\r\npooling agreement between the competing lines.[25]\r\n\r\nFrom 1875 to 1885 the trunk lines to the Atlantic ports were thus\r\nengaged in active competition. What was the effect of this upon the\r\nBaltimore & Ohio? This road was highly prosperous in 1875. Dividends\r\nof 6 per cent and 10 per cent were being paid. The capitalization was\r\nsmall, and the management conservative. During the ten years following\r\n1875 the rate of dividend was not materially decreased. In 1876 10 per\r\ncent was paid. In 1877 the old 8 per cent rate was restored, and the\r\nfollowing year the distribution was made in stock instead of in cash.\r\nAfter the agreement of 1878 one-half year’s dividend was paid in cash;\r\nand in 1879 9 per cent cash, and in 1880 10 per cent cash was declared,\r\nthis rate enduring until 1886. But although dividends were maintained,\r\nthe effect of the railroad wars appeared in the slowness with which\r\nnet earnings increased. A comparison of the net returns of 1884 with\r\nthose of 1874 reveals a gain of 40 per cent, on a mileage 27 per cent\r\ngreater; but the figures for 1885 show an increase of less than 2 per\r\ncent over those for 1874, while the totals for 1884 were not again\r\nequalled until 1900. Meanwhile more bonds had been issued, and the\r\npercentage of fixed charges to net earnings had increased from 16 in\r\n1874 to 63 in 1884. In other words, money was borrowed to put into the\r\nroad which did little more than keep the net earnings from declining.\r\nIn that same time the stock increased $2,900,000, and according to the\r\nprofit and loss account $15,559,636 were put into the property, making\r\na total of $55,743,092 (of this $37,197,696 were bonds); the only\r\nresult of which was the building of 313 miles of line, and the securing\r\nof an increase in net earnings for 1884, which was swept away the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 the elder Garrett died, and his son Robert was elected to\r\nsucceed him. The old policy of independence and competition was\r\ncontinued, the objective point being now an entrance into New York.\r\n“When in 1885 the other trunk lines harmonized their differences, ...”\r\nsaid the Chronicle, “the Baltimore & Ohio ... pursued its policy of\r\naggression.... The road must reach Philadelphia ... nay, must push\r\n... on to New York.... Instead of seeking to avoid rivalry, its every\r\neffort seemed to encourage it. Rates were reduced, concessions made\r\nto shippers and travellers, the one idea apparently being to get\r\ntraffic no matter what the cost.”[26] The necessity of a secure New\r\nYork connection had been impressed upon the company in the course\r\nof the rate wars. The first step was to be actual construction to\r\nPhiladelphia, the second, construction or traffic agreements from\r\nPhiladelphia to New York. Bonds were issued in April, 1883, for\r\nconstruction of a so-called Philadelphia branch from Baltimore to the\r\nnorthern boundary of Cecil County, Maryland,[27] there to connect with\r\nthe Baltimore & Philadelphia Railroad, which was being built through\r\nDelaware and Pennsylvania to Philadelphia. Entrance into Philadelphia\r\nwas secured over the Schuylkill River East Side Railway, a corporation\r\norganized under the laws of Pennsylvania and doing business in the city\r\nonly.[28] The distance was approximately ninety-nine miles; the cost\r\nwas later asserted to have been $20,000,000. Beyond Philadelphia the\r\nBaltimore & Ohio relied on an agreement with the Philadelphia & Reading\r\nfor trackage to Bound Brook, New Jersey,[29] and on a traffic contract\r\nwith the Central of New Jersey for its line from Bound Brook to\r\nElizabeth.[30] Terminals on Staten Island were secured by purchase of\r\na controlling interest in the Staten Island Rapid Transit Company,[31]\r\nand connection between Elizabeth and the Island was obtained by new\r\nconstruction. The strength of this route was in its directness and\r\nin its independence of trunk-line control; its weakness was in its\r\nexcessive cost between Baltimore and Philadelphia, and in its reliance\r\nupon traffic contracts north of the latter city. A proposition was\r\nadvanced to unite the Baltimore & Ohio, the Philadelphia & Reading,\r\nand the Central of New Jersey with the Richmond Terminal System. This,\r\nhowever, fell through,[32] and the possibility still existed that\r\nthe Baltimore & Ohio might some day construct a line of its own from\r\nPhiladelphia to New York.\r\n\r\nPending the completion of the preceding arrangements rate conditions\r\nremained naturally unsatisfactory. The Pennsylvania objected to the\r\nparalleling of its Philadelphia-New York branch, and refused to allow\r\ntemporary use of that line by the Baltimore & Ohio while the latter’s\r\nindependent connections were being established.[33] Freight rates\r\nwere slowly and painfully raised after the conflict of 1884–5, and\r\ndid not regain a high level. In 1886 the Baltimore & Ohio was forced\r\nto reduce its dividends from 10 to 8 per cent. The following year it\r\ncut to 4 per cent, and in 1888 no dividend at all was declared. The\r\nsurplus on the year’s operations, which had not since 1878 fallen below\r\n$1,000,000, dropped to $110,819 in 1885, and to $36,259 in 1886. As\r\ndividends decreased, the funded debt increased,[34] the percentage\r\nof fixed charges to net income rose from 63 to 89, and the floating\r\ndebt attained the portentous amount of $11,148,007. The only item\r\nwhich did not grow was net earnings. There was nothing occult in the\r\nsituation. Every one was well aware that the competition to which the\r\nBaltimore & Ohio had been subjected had been severe, and that the cost\r\nof its New York extension had been large. In 1887 the bonds outstanding\r\nwere $56,868,201, the stock $19,792,566, and the accumulated surplus\r\n$48,083,720, or a total of $124,744,487. This stood for the sums\r\ninvested in the property. Net income on the other hand was $4,994,721;\r\nso that on an investment of over $100,000,000 but 4 per cent was being\r\nobtained to cover interest, improvements, and whatever dividend might\r\nbe declared.\r\n\r\nThat no general apprehension was felt by investors before 1887 was\r\ndue to the great prestige which the Baltimore & Ohio enjoyed. The\r\nlong series of dividends counted heavily in favor of the road.\r\nThe enormous accumulated surplus, said to have been invested in\r\nvaluable improvements and extensions;[35] the enterprise of the\r\ncompany in making extensions; the large volume of business; and the\r\nconfident statements of the president, all conspired to prevent a\r\ntoo keen analysis of the business returns.[36] Relief of two sorts\r\nwas nevertheless required. In the first place the floating debt had\r\ngrown so large that some means of paying it off was necessary; in the\r\nsecond place the road needed a sufficient reduction in fixed charges\r\nto restore some of the margin of non-mortgaged earnings which had\r\nbeen so great a safeguard in the early days. Only the first of these\r\nrequirements was met. Cash the road had to have; the existing fixed\r\ncharges, it was thought, it could endure if only some abatement of the\r\nintensity of trunk-line competition could be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe method chosen for raising cash was the sale of bonds. In September,\r\n1887, J. P. Morgan & Co. announced that a preliminary contract had\r\nbeen entered into between the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company and\r\nJ. S. Morgan & Co., Baring Bros. & Co., and Brown, Shipley & Co.,\r\nof London, and their allied houses in America, for the negotiation\r\nof $5,000,000 Baltimore & Ohio Consolidated 5s and of $5,000,000\r\npreferred stock, for the purpose of paying off the entire floating\r\ndebt, and of placing the company upon a sound financial basis.[37]\r\nThe consolidated bonds were to be part of an authorized issue of\r\n$29,600,000, of which $21,423,000 were to be reserved to retire the\r\nmain stem mortgage indebtedness when it should fall due, and $8,177,112\r\nwere to be exchanged for securities in the company’s sinking fund, the\r\nfreed securities to be used to pay the floating debt in part. In case\r\nthis exchange should not be made, $7,500,000 of the issue might be sold\r\ndirect, and the syndicate before mentioned agreed to take $5,000,000 of\r\nthis amount and to place $5,000,000 in preferred stock on condition:\r\n\r\n(_a_) That the statements of the company should be verified;\r\n\r\n(_b_) That the management of the company should be placed in competent\r\nhands, satisfactory to the syndicate;\r\n\r\n(_c_) That satisfactory contracts should be made between the Baltimore\r\n& Ohio and other roads for New York business, which should remove\r\nall antagonism between them on the subject, and should ensure the\r\npermanent working of the first-named in entire harmony with the other\r\ntrunk lines, besides avoiding the construction, or the threat of\r\nconstruction, of expensive lines north and east of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nAnnual payments to the Baltimore & Ohio sinking funds were to be made\r\nin the future in consols instead of in cash.[38]\r\n\r\nThe essence of this arrangement was a funding of the floating debt,\r\nplus agreements with other roads in order to maintain earnings. The\r\nfunding involved, however, a certain increase of charges through the\r\nissue of bonds, while the agreements offered but a doubtful chance of\r\nincreased earnings. Only by an effective community of interest or of\r\nownership among the trunk lines could a saving have been secured on\r\nwhich the new bond issues could safely have relied. That this was to\r\ntake place through the syndicate, that body was emphatic in denying.\r\n“The statement,” said Vice-President Spencer, “that the Baltimore &\r\nOhio Railroad has passed into the hands of a syndicate, of which J. P.\r\nMorgan is the head, is absolutely without foundation.... The syndicate\r\nhas the greatest interest now in the growth of the Baltimore & Ohio,\r\nand to secure this growth and progress absolute independence of other\r\ncorporate predominance is essential, and the road must be worked in\r\nthe interest of the states and territories it reaches.”[39] This\r\ndeclaration left only informal agreements as a resort; for pooling\r\nhad been forbidden in 1887. It did more, it implied the necessity of\r\na maintenance of competition, for to work the Baltimore & Ohio in the\r\ninterest of Baltimore meant to work it against the interest of New\r\nYork. In principle the plan was nevertheless adopted. Bondholders\r\nsaw no necessity for a radical reorganization, and were willing to\r\nconsent only to a new issue of bonds. Certain modifications were,\r\nhowever, imposed. The exchange of new bonds for securities in the\r\nsinking fund was abandoned, and the alternative of direct sale was\r\nembraced. It was found impossible to secure the consent of stockholders\r\nto an increase in the preferred stock, three attempts to obtain the\r\nrequired authorization failing in the week ending January 20, 1888.[40]\r\nFurthermore, the failure of the stock issue led President Spencer[41]\r\nto request that the city of Baltimore extend for five years at 4 per\r\ncent a $5,000,000 loan to the company, which was to mature in two\r\nyears, and that it return the sinking fund of $2,400,000 which had\r\naccumulated in its hands for the eventual cancellation of the debt.[42]\r\nIt may be added that this suggestion was not accepted.\r\n\r\nWhile awaiting final settlement of the syndicate scheme the Baltimore\r\n& Ohio obtained some cash from the disposal of all its free resources;\r\nthat is, from the telegraph, express, and sleeping-car businesses which\r\nit had conducted since early in the administration of John Garrett. In\r\nAugust, 1887, it sold its express business to the United States Express\r\nCompany for a period of thirty years, in return for $1,500,000 of the\r\ncapital stock of the express company plus a certain percentage of the\r\nannual earnings of the express lines handed over.[43] In October of\r\nthe same year its telegraph business was turned over to the Western\r\nUnion Telegraph Company in return for $5,000,000 of the Western Union\r\nstock, and an annual payment of $60,000 in cash.[44] Finally, in June,\r\n1888, its sleeping-car equipment and franchises were transferred to the\r\nPullman Company for a period of twenty-five years at a reported price\r\nof $1,250,000.[45] The company agreed to furnish all the sleeping and\r\nparlor cars required. This brought the incidental advantage of ending\r\nlong-continued suits over patents. The terms of sale to the telegraph\r\nand express companies brought in no ready money, but the securities\r\nobtained were readily salable, and being independent for their value\r\nof the commercial success of the Baltimore & Ohio were available for\r\ntimes of difficulty. It was this policy which offset the refusal of the\r\ncity of Baltimore to return the sinking fund to the company, and which\r\nby March, 1888, rendered the road even to some extent independent of\r\nthe syndicate. At that date a modification of the syndicate agreement\r\ntook place. The bankers gave up all claim to the $5,000,000 of stock\r\nso long under discussion, and took instead the balance ($2,500,000)\r\nof the $7,500,000 consolidated mortgage bonds which the company was\r\nauthorized to sell. “The syndicate acted,” said the Baltimore _Sun_,\r\n“in an entirely friendly spirit, and, with a desire to continue its\r\nfinancial relations with the company, took the remaining $2,500,000 ...\r\nat a better price than was paid for the $5,000,000.”[46]\r\n\r\nWith temporary financial requirements provided for, President Spencer\r\nwas enabled to achieve some much-needed reforms. At a meeting of the\r\ndirectors on March 14 a complete reorganization of the service was\r\nauthorized, with changes and transfers affecting employees from the\r\nfirst vice-president down. Later a committee of mechanical experts\r\nwas organized “to examine thoroughly all the shops, shop tools, etc.,\r\nof the entire Baltimore & Ohio system, and to report on all the\r\nimprovements needed.”[47] The form of the annual report was improved.\r\nThe much-quoted surplus, which had proved such an unreliable support,\r\nwas cut in two by the writing off of bad investments, the marking down\r\nof the price of securities, and the like; and, finally, a committee was\r\nappointed to make a general examination of the financial as well as the\r\nphysical condition of affairs.[48] “Great anxiety,” said a resolution\r\nof the directors, “exists in the public mind as to the financial\r\ncondition and the value and earning capacity of the road and property\r\n... [and] it is due to all interests that a full, frank, and complete\r\nstatement of its affairs should be made public.” So far as lay in his\r\npower President Spencer, and through him the syndicate, tried to secure\r\na real and permanent improvement in the condition of the road, and\r\nto gain, through increased efficiency in operation, the margin which\r\nthe refusal to cut down fixed charges had denied. The failure of the\r\nattempt may be ascribed to the continuance of the Garrett family in\r\npower. Any irregularities or mistakes which had taken place in the past\r\nreflected on the Garretts, so that it was to their interest to stifle\r\ninvestigation. Moreover, any change in policy for the future implied\r\na criticism of their acts to which they were reluctant to accede. In\r\n1888 the Garrett holdings amounted to from 50,000 to 60,000 shares out\r\nof a total of 150,000 shares, or, deducting 32,500 shares held by the\r\ncity of Baltimore, which were not entitled to vote, to about one-half\r\nof a total of 117,500 shares. This gave undisputed control. The effect\r\nwas seen in the annual election in November. Of 12 old members of the\r\nboard only 5 were reëlected, and of the 7 dropped 3 formed part of\r\nthe investigating committee engaged in securing “the full, frank, and\r\ncomplete statement of the company’s condition” promised at an earlier\r\ndate.[49] The same month President Spencer was ousted and Mr. Charles\r\nF. Mayer was elected in his place.\r\n\r\nThis revolution was fatal to any radical reform, so that during the\r\nnext seven years the condition of the Baltimore & Ohio improved but\r\nlittle. Net income grew, it is true, up to the panic year of 1893, but\r\nfell so sharply after that that the reported figures for 1895 exceeded\r\nthose of 1888 by but $1,283,843, and even this gain was practically\r\nwiped out during the following year. Meanwhile fixed charges grew from\r\n$6,550,972 in 1888 to $6,934,052 in 1895, and to $7,303,781 in 1896;\r\nan increase which transformed the profits of the company the following\r\nyear into a deficit. A comparison of the balance-sheets of 1888 and\r\n1895 shows an increase of $10,207,434 in stock, of $16,261,000 in\r\nfunded debt, and of $4,554,939 in floating debt. These changes were\r\noffset mainly by increases in bonds and stock owned, or in the hands\r\nof trustees, by advances to subsidiary lines, and by a reduction of\r\n$11,080,000 in bonded debt secured by collateral or by mortgage on\r\nthe main line. During this time dividends were nevertheless steadily\r\npaid on the preferred stock, and, beginning in 1891, upon the common\r\nstock as well. The liberal tendencies of the management were also\r\nevinced by a 20 per cent dividend upon the common stock, declared in\r\n1891 to compensate shareholders for expenditures in betterments and\r\nimprovements of the physical condition of the property.[50] It will be\r\nseen how different this was from the policy of retrenchment and economy\r\nwhich had been inaugurated by President Spencer, and which might fairly\r\nhave been expected from a corporation barely escaped from bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nTraffic conditions from 1887 to 1893 were very far from satisfactory.\r\nThe difficulties between the Baltimore & Ohio and the Pennsylvania were\r\nindeed patched up, and the opening of the former’s lines to New York\r\nrendered it independent of other trunk-line connections; but frequent\r\ncharges of rate cutting were made in 1887, and a war in dressed-beef\r\nrates was inaugurated by the Grand Trunk in November of that year.\r\nIn 1888 rates were pretty much demoralized. Published rates on grain\r\ndropped from 27½ cents in January to 20 cents in October. Emigrant\r\nrates from New York to western points became the subject of active\r\ncompetition; and, most important of all, the dressed-beef controversy\r\nwas pushed till it developed into a war of the most active kind. The\r\ntrouble here was started by cuts on dressed beef by the Grand Trunk.\r\nIn May other lines retaliated by cuts in live-stock rates; by July\r\n14 published rates on cattle from Chicago to New York were 5½ cents\r\nper 100 pounds, and on dressed beef and hogs 7 cents. In November\r\nthe New York Central extended the contest by a general reduction in\r\nwest-bound rates.[51] These struggles, though terminated for a time\r\nby an agreement of February, 1889,[52] seriously diminished railway\r\nrevenues, and prevented the rapid growth which the general prosperity\r\nof the country might have occasioned.[53] In fact, the Erie management\r\nstated in their annual report for 1888 that their company had retired\r\naltogether from certain classes of through business for a time during\r\nthe preceding twelve months, owing to the unremunerative level of\r\nrates. Conditions during the greater part of 1889 were better,[54]\r\nand during the following three years constant attempts at agreement\r\nand arbitration, joined with a considerable volume of business,[55]\r\nprevented a long continuance of any difficulties which arose.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps traffic conditions such as we have described which\r\nled the Garrett family to favor a community of interest scheme which\r\nshould improve the Baltimore & Ohio connections with the West. In June,\r\n1890, Mr. E. R. Bacon formed a syndicate to control the stock of the\r\nBaltimore & Ohio Company. Acting in harmony with the Garrett family,\r\nthe syndicate was made up of Philadelphia, New York, Baltimore, and\r\nPittsburg capitalists, including the Richmond Terminal, Pittsburgh\r\n& Western, Northern Pacific, and Reading interests. The plan was to\r\nestablish a community of interest between a vast network of lines\r\nreaching from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from New York to the\r\nMississippi. “The buyers,” it was said, “came in simply as investors\r\nwithout condition that their other properties would be benefited,\r\nalthough it was of course intimated that something was to be done.”[56]\r\nThey were required to pool their stock for three years, and to give an\r\nirrevocable proxy for that period to President Charles F. Mayer. The\r\namount of the syndicate purchase was 45,000 shares, of which 32,500\r\nwere obtained from the city of Baltimore, and 9686 (preferred) from\r\nthe state of Maryland;[57] and the purchase brought the incidental\r\nadvantage of removing city and state from any direct interest in the\r\nroad. The preferred state stock the syndicate later exchanged for\r\ncommon stock owned by the Johns Hopkins University. The purchase once\r\nmade, the pool was formed on well-known lines. The stock was deposited\r\nwith a trust company, trust certificates were issued, and proxies\r\ntransferred to Charles F. Mayer.[58] The shares to be deposited were\r\nlimited in amount to 110,000; the actual amount put in was 89,750. The\r\nresults of the agreement were less sensational than the forecasts made.\r\nIt undoubtedly did much to promote friendly feeling among the roads\r\nconcerned. When, in 1891, the Baltimore & Ohio was compelled to vacate\r\nthe Chicago terminals of the Illinois Central, which it had occupied\r\nfor years, it was able to make prompt arrangements with a corporation\r\ncontrolled by the Northern Pacific for the use of its facilities both\r\nfor passengers and for freight. But the influence of the Garrett family\r\nwas not lessened, and inasmuch as the main competitors of the Baltimore\r\n& Ohio were not included there was no check to competition, and\r\nearnings showed no striking change.\r\n\r\nMatters stood thus at the beginning of 1893.[59] No progress had been\r\nmade toward restoring the Baltimore & Ohio to a permanently stable\r\ncondition, and the prosperity which its reports declared was fictitious\r\nonly. The reorganization to which bondholders had refused to submit\r\nin the comparatively prosperous times of 1888 was compelled by the\r\ndepression following the panic of 1893. In 1894 earnings fell off. The\r\ngross earnings for the year ending June 30, 1893, were $26,214,807,\r\nand the net income $9,210,666; the following year the same items were\r\n$22,502,662 and $8,719,830. The directors reduced the dividend and\r\ncalled attention to the losses incurred through protracted strikes in\r\nthe coal and coke industry.[60] The following January (1895) President\r\nMayer stated that the fixed charges, including the car trusts, sinking\r\nfunds, etc., due January 1, amounting to nearly $1,000,000, had been\r\npaid without borrowing one dollar. “I name this fact especially,” said\r\nhe, “because it is not unusual for us to make a loan for the unusually\r\nheavy payments January 1. I doubt if the Baltimore & Ohio has owed so\r\nsmall a floating debt for twelve or fifteen years, perhaps longer, and\r\nit never had the large volume of stocks and bonds it now has, something\r\nover $16,000,000, not put down at their face value but rather at their\r\nmarket value, or far below their intrinsic value. I can safely say the\r\nroad has not been in so strong a position as now for at least fifteen\r\nyears.”[61]\r\n\r\nIt required more than confident statements by the managers, however,\r\nto demonstrate the secure position of the road; and this all the more\r\nbecause the acts of these gentlemen belied their public assertions.\r\nDividends on the common stock were passed in 1895, and again in 1896.\r\nThe ratio of charges to earnings, according to the company’s reports,\r\nrose from 75 per cent of net earnings in 1894 to 80.2 per cent in 1895,\r\nand to 98.2 per cent in 1896; that is, less than 2 per cent of the\r\nnet earnings of $6,300,000 was admitted to be available for dividends\r\non $30,000,000 of stock.[62] Some relief was evidently necessary. In\r\nJanuary, 1896, it was announced that arrangements had been made with a\r\nstrong syndicate to provide for all immediate financial requirements;\r\nbut the appointment of receivers in February could scarcely have come\r\nas a surprise. During the two weeks just before the failure Mr. J. K.\r\nCowen, who had succeeded Mr. Mayer in the presidency, spent a great\r\ndeal of time in New York trying to borrow money to meet the pressing\r\ndemands. On his eventual failure and return to Baltimore the directors\r\nfelt that a friendly receivership was the only resource.[63]\r\n\r\nTo the well-wishers of the road this failure may have seemed an\r\nopportunity as well as a disaster. It was now possible to accomplish\r\nwhat the management in 1888 had refused to attempt, _i. e._ a\r\nreduction in the fixed charges of the company which should remove\r\nthe burdens under which the road had labored, and should open up the\r\nway for a long period of improvement and prosperity. At least one\r\nmore unpleasant experience was, however, to be passed through. With a\r\nview to determining the Baltimore & Ohio’s real position, an expert\r\naccountant, Mr. Stephen Little, had been set to work upon its books,\r\nand from time to time notices had been appearing that he was at work,\r\nthat his examinations confirmed the statements of the company, and that\r\nquestions raised by hostile critics would be considered in his report.\r\nThus in April a reorganization committee, composed of Messrs. Alexander\r\nShaw, C. Morton Stuart, and six others, with whom were deposited the\r\nGarrett shares, issued a circular referring to the large amount of new\r\ncapital, estimated by them at $30,000,000, which had been received by\r\nthe company since 1888 “without adequate or satisfactory results,” and\r\nto the floating debt, which they asserted had been increased from about\r\n$3,500,000 to $16,000,000. “We make no charges, or even intimations of\r\nwrongdoing,” wrote their secretary, “but desire and require that a full\r\nexplanation of the management of the property from the year 1888, when\r\nthe road was set on its feet by Mr. Morgan, shall be given, and that\r\nthe causes which led to the wrecking of the property shall be clearly\r\nshown.” To which another committee, which directly represented the\r\nmanagement, replied by reference to Mr. Little.[64]\r\n\r\nThe much-heralded report came out in December, having been withheld\r\nsince the previous March for fear of the effect on the company’s\r\nsecurities; and so far from sustaining the management, it contained\r\ncharges of irregularity almost as sensational as those made against the\r\nAtchison at an earlier date. The books of the company, according to Mr.\r\nLittle, were in error to the amount of $11,204,858. During the period\r\nof seven years and two months which his report covered he found:\r\n\r\n  An overstatement of net income of                       $2,721,068\r\n  A mischarge of worn-out equipment to profit and loss of  2,843,596\r\n  Improper capitalization of charges to income under the\r\n    head of construction, main stem,                       2,064,741\r\n  Improper capitalization of so-called improvements and\r\n    betterments of leased and dependent roads,             3,575,453\r\n                                                         -----------\r\n            Total,                                       $11,204,858[65]\r\n\r\nDeducting these sums from the annual income returns of the company,\r\nhe found that but $971,447 had been earned which had been properly\r\napplicable to dividends, whereas $6,269,008 had been declared in the\r\nseven years, of which $3,312,089 were cash and $2,956,920 stock.\r\nEarnings had been increased by the most arbitrary of book-keeping\r\ndevices. In 1892 the value of the Western Union stock held in the\r\ntreasury since the sale of the Baltimore & Ohio telegraph lines in\r\n1888 had been written up $468,038, and the stock of another company,\r\nthe Consolidated Coal Company, had been written up $114,300. Not only\r\nhad advances to branch lines been entered as assets, but the interest\r\non these advances had been credited to income, the only basis being\r\nthat it was hoped that such interest would some day be paid; and on\r\nthe other side of the account, charges against operating expenses had\r\nbeen charged to profit and loss on the same principles by which the\r\nGarretts had rolled up their fictitious surplus of 1888. Turning to the\r\ncapital account, Mr. Little showed an increase in liabilities from 1888\r\nto 1895 of $22,180,000, not including $5,481,835 representing chiefly\r\nthe company’s endorsements of notes of its subsidiary roads which stood\r\nhere for the first time revealed. This money apparently had been put\r\ninto the property, and yet Mr. Little’s corrected figures showed net\r\nearnings to be actually smaller in 1895 than in the earlier years.\r\nCriticisms of the report attached themselves mainly to the last items\r\ntreated. That the extensive endorsement of branch-line notes, absent\r\nas any mention of the practice was from the annual reports, was most\r\nmisleading and unsound, nobody could deny; but the broad question\r\nof what charges during the seven years should have been paid out of\r\nincome, and what not, gave rise to lively discussion. Severe strictures\r\non Mr. Little’s statements were made by Patterson and Corwin, two\r\naccountants appointed to re-examine the books of the company. “It would\r\nappear,” said they, “that Mr. Little has made some curious errors, and\r\nhas been strikingly inconsistent.”[66] Nevertheless the more damaging\r\nof the latter’s accusations seem to have been accepted, and the\r\nBaltimore & Ohio took its place with other American corporations, the\r\nmanagements of which have indulged in secret juggling with the books.\r\n\r\nPending Mr. Little’s report, reorganization was of course delayed.\r\nThe receivers were then in control,[67] and under their direction a\r\nvigorous policy of improvement was carried out. The rolling stock\r\nof the system was found to be insufficient to handle its business,\r\nand the motive power was in similar condition. All testified to\r\nthe consistent desire of the old management to employ every device\r\nwhich might contribute to greater apparent earnings. Contracts for\r\n5000 freight cars were let as early as May, 1896, to be paid for in\r\nreceivers’ certificates, and bids for 75 locomotives were at the same\r\ntime received.[68] During their whole administration the receivers\r\npurchased over 28,000 freight cars, 216 locomotives, 123,000 tons of\r\nrails, besides ties, ballast, new steel bridges, and miscellaneous\r\nimprovements of various sorts.[69] On the financial side they had to\r\nresist an attempt to compel payment of dividends on the preferred\r\nstock. The case dragged on through 1897 and 1898, and was finally\r\ndecided in favor of the company.[70]\r\n\r\nAfter the publication of Mr. Little’s report there remained no serious\r\nbar to reorganization, while the needs to be met were more apparent\r\nthan ever before. If the proportion of charges to earnings had been\r\ntoo heavy on the management’s own showing, how much more burdensome\r\nwas it when the reported earnings had been proved too high, and the\r\nreported liabilities too low! The first step after the appointment of\r\nreceivers had been the springing up of reorganization committees. The\r\ntwo most prominent were the Fitzgerald Committee, representing the\r\ndirectors, and the Baltimore Committee. There were besides committees\r\nrepresenting the 5 per cent bonds of the loan of 1885, the consolidated\r\nmortgage 5s, the 6 per cent bonds of 1874, the preferred stock, and\r\nothers. These were all to some extent antagonistic. It was hoped to\r\nsecure a reorganization without foreclosure, but to provide against all\r\ncontingencies a bill was introduced and passed through the Maryland\r\nlegislature, permitting a new company to succeed, after reorganization,\r\nto the property of the Baltimore & Ohio system.\r\n\r\nBy April, 1898, a reorganization plan was ready, and was withheld only\r\non account, first of the threatened, and then of the actual, war with\r\nSpain. Two months later this difficulty seemed no longer serious, and\r\na plan was formally announced.[71] There were contemplated two great\r\nissues of bonds and two of stock as follows:\r\n\r\n  3½ per cent prior lien gold bonds,             $70,000,000\r\n  4 per cent first mortgage gold bonds,           50,000,000\r\n  4 per cent non-cumulative preferred stock,      35,000,000\r\n  Common stock,                                   35,000,000\r\n\r\nThese were to be parts of larger amounts authorized but not issued.\r\nThus the authorized amount of prior liens was $75,000,000, of which\r\n$5,000,000 were to be reserved, and to be issued after January 1,\r\n1902, at the rate of not exceeding $1,000,000 a year, for enlargement,\r\nbetterment, or extension of properties covered by the prior lien\r\nmortgage; or for the acquisition of additions thereto.[72] The\r\nauthorized amount of first mortgage 4s was $165,000,000. Since\r\nthe prior liens matured in 1925, and this mortgage not till 1948,\r\n$75,000,000 were reserved for retirement of the prior issue.\r\n$7,000,000 were further put aside for the new company; $6,000,000\r\nfor the retirement of the Baltimore Belt Line 5s, and $27,000,000 for\r\nenlargements, betterments, or extensions, etc., at a rate not exceeding\r\n$1,500,000 a year for four years, and not exceeding $1,000,000 a year\r\nthereafter.[73] The reserves from these two mortgages, therefore, made\r\nliberal provision for new capital requirements. All of the common\r\nstock authorized was to be issued at once; but besides the $35,000,000\r\npreferred stock before mentioned, $5,000,000 preferred were to be held\r\nin reserve for the new company.\r\n\r\nOf the immediate issues $60,073,090 prior liens, $36,384,535 first\r\nmortgage 4s, $17,218,700 preferred stock, and $31,178,000 common stock\r\nwent toward the retirement of old securities; and $9,000,000 prior\r\nliens, $12,450,000 first mortgage 4s, and $16,450,000 preferred stock\r\nwere for cash requirements. The better of the old mortgages received\r\ncash for their overdue interest, something over par in prior liens\r\nfor their principal, and from 12½ to 32 per cent in first mortgage\r\n4s and preferred stock to compensate for reductions in their annual\r\nreturn. Inferior bonds received new first mortgage 4s with preferred\r\nstock (except in one instance) as a douceur. The old stock, common and\r\npreferred, and the Washington City & Point Lookout 6s got mostly new\r\nstock for the principal of their holdings, and preferred stock for\r\ntheir assessments. The fundamental principle on which the exchanges\r\nwere based was the retirement of old bonds bearing high interest\r\nrates by an increased volume of new bonds bearing lower rates; thus\r\npermitting a much smaller reduction in fixed charges than occurred\r\nin other reorganizations which we shall consider. To some extent\r\nreductions in annual yield were made up by allowance of preferred\r\nstock. The consolidated mortgage 5s of 1887, on which interest was\r\nreduced from $50 annually to $41.75, received $85 in 4 per cent\r\npreferred stock as a compensation. The Baltimore & Ohio Loan of 1874\r\nsaw a reduction in interest from $60 to $40.41, partially made up from\r\nthe dividends on $160 of new preferred stock. In fact, out of thirteen\r\ncases in which new bonds were given for old, ten included an allowance\r\nof preferred stock, thus bringing the Baltimore & Ohio in line with\r\nother reorganizations of the period. But the proportion of preferred\r\nstock given was small in each case, and the principle was not well\r\ncarried out.[74]\r\n\r\nThe cash requirements of the system were estimated at $36,092,500;\r\nbeing swelled by arrears of interest, receivers’ certificates, need\r\nfor working capital, reorganization expenditures, and the like. The\r\nplan proposed to cancel them by assessments on stockholders and by the\r\nsale of securities before described. On the first preferred stock, $2\r\na share was levied, $20 on the second preferred, and $20 on the common\r\nstock, with a syndicate guarantee for each. This netted $5,460,000.\r\nStockholders received new preferred stock for their payments. Deducting\r\n$5,460,000 preferred stock from the securities reserved under the\r\nplan to be sold for cash, there remained $9,000,000 prior liens,\r\n$12,450,000 first mortgage 4s, and $10,990,000 preferred stock, or a\r\ntotal of $32,440,000; all of which a syndicate agreed to take.[75]\r\nIn addition the company disposed of securities in the treasury,\r\nincluding $3,800,000 stock of the Western Union Telegraph Company, for\r\n$3,500,000.[76]\r\n\r\nBoth classes of stock were vested in five voting trustees, for a period\r\nof five years. The trustees might, however, deliver the stock at an\r\nearlier date in their discretion, and in fact did so in August, 1901.\r\nNo additional mortgage was to be put upon the property, and no increase\r\nin the amount of the preferred stock was to be made, except in each\r\ninstance after obtaining the consent of the holders of a majority of\r\nthe whole amount of preferred stock outstanding, given at a meeting\r\nof the stockholders called for that purpose, and the consent of the\r\nholders of a majority of such part of the common stock as should\r\nbe represented at such meeting, the holders of each class of stock\r\nvoting separately. During the existence of the voting trust similar\r\nconsent of holders of like amounts of the respective classes of trust\r\ncertificates was to be necessary for the purposes indicated. Only a\r\nportion of the leased and dependent lines were provided for in the\r\nplan, but the various cases were left to be passed on separately. Thus\r\nthe Baltimore Belt Line was finally leased at a rental equivalent to\r\n4 per cent on the outstanding 5 per cent bonds; while the acquisition\r\nof the Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern and the Central Ohio railroads\r\ninvolved the payment of a cash bonus, and an increase in the preferred\r\nand common stock outstanding. The mileage of the system suffered little\r\nchange. Many of the branches were sold at foreclosure, and bought in\r\nby the parent line; and a glance at the balance-sheet in 1899 shows\r\nthat besides the prior liens and the first 4s, an issue of Pittsburg\r\nJunction and Middle Division bonds was the principal tool employed.\r\nThese securities, bearing 3½ per cent, and falling due in 1925, were\r\nissued; 1st, to retire branch-line securities, and to weld the system\r\ninto one united whole; and 2d, to provide new capital for enlargement\r\nand betterment and extension.\r\n\r\nThe success of this Baltimore & Ohio reorganization plan was very\r\nlargely due to the time at which it was put through. In other words,\r\nthe reorganization was completed just when an unparalleled era of\r\nprosperity was fairly under way. The moderate reduction in fixed\r\ncharges which it secured proved more than adequate when earnings\r\nrapidly grew. The net earnings of the property for the year ending\r\nJune 30, 1898, were estimated at $7,724,758, and the new fixed charges\r\nwere set at $6,252,351.[77] Net earnings for 1899 were $6,621,599.\r\nIn 1900, on a mileage 11 per cent greater, they were $12,359,443,\r\nand fixed charges were $6,831,463 only. In subsequent years, with an\r\nincrease both in mileage and in earnings, the margin between charges\r\nand income further increased. In 1903 $3,500,000 were spent out of\r\nearnings for additions and improvements; $7,370,482 were declared in\r\ndividends; and $2,947,681 were carried to surplus. In 1907 $3,000,000\r\nwere spent in additions and improvements, $6,965,245 paid in dividends,\r\n$7,480,385 carried to surplus. This situation was in no way due to the\r\nreorganization plan, and would have restored the company to solvency\r\neven if no reorganization had taken place. It may be said that the\r\nreceivership did much to enable the road to take advantage of the later\r\nprosperity. The character of the receivers’ work has been mentioned.\r\nBy June 30, 1899, they had spent as much as $17,000,000 for cars\r\nalone, $2,500,000 for locomotives, $2,100,000 for rails, and other\r\nsums for improvements and renewals of all kinds. The maintenance of\r\nway pay-rolls in three years amounted to nearly $12,000,000, and the\r\ntotal expenditure aggregated about $35,000,000; of which $15,000,000\r\nwere secured by the issue of receivers’ certificates, and the\r\nbalance through car trusts, earnings from the property, and from the\r\nreorganization managers.[78] This was an indispensable and invaluable\r\npreliminary to a growth in earnings, but was, however, distinct from\r\nthe financial problems of reorganization. In brief, the Baltimore\r\n& Ohio increased its nominal capitalization more, and reduced its\r\nfixed charges less than any of the seven other reorganizations of the\r\nnineties which we shall consider except the Erie. Its need was perhaps\r\nless crying, but not sufficiently so to explain the difference.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that, while provision had early been made for\r\nforeclosure, it had been hoped to avoid such a drastic step. Hopes in\r\nthis respect were fulfilled, and while a number of branch lines were\r\nsold the main stem escaped. Vigorous objections to the plan came from\r\nthe preferred stock, which was in 1898 suing to compel payment of its\r\ndividends. In July, at a meeting of shareholders it was declared to be\r\nthe sense of the meeting that the preferred stock could not justly be\r\nrequired to determine whether it would accept the proposition published\r\nby the reorganization committee before the case in the Supreme Court\r\nshould be decided.[79] Late in July an injunction was obtained, which,\r\nhowever, was dissolved in October. Still later in that year the suits\r\nwere settled by the sale of the bulk of the first preferred stock\r\nto the reorganization committee.[80] The only other considerable\r\ncomplaint came from the holders of the 4½ per cent Baltimore & Ohio\r\nTerminal bonds, and was a protest against the reduction of ½ per cent\r\nin their interest without, as they said, the smallest compensation.\r\nSuits for the foreclosure of the mortgages of 1887, 1872, and 1874 were\r\ninstituted in October, 1898. Decrees were obtained in February. Decrees\r\nwere also given against the Philadelphia Division, the Parkersburg\r\nBranch, the Staten Island Rapid Transit Company, and others. Separate\r\nreceivers had previously been appointed for the Sandusky, Mansfield &\r\nNewark, the Central Ohio, the Washington Branch, and others. Decrees\r\nwere not asked for against the main line. In August, 1898, only three\r\nmonths after the publication of the plan, the reorganization managers\r\nwere able to pronounce it effective.\r\n\r\nThe receivers surrendered control July 1, 1899,[81] and the company\r\nstarted on its new career amid a buzz of satisfaction from all who had\r\nparticipated in its reorganization. In an address before the Maryland\r\nBar Association Mr. John K. Cowen summarized the result as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) Every bondholder of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad has received new\r\nsecurities which substantially pay his full debt. In other words, the\r\nbondholders have been paid in full.\r\n\r\n(2) The floating debt creditors have received every cent of their\r\nindebtedness.\r\n\r\n(3) The first preferred stockholders have received in cash 75 per cent\r\nof the par value of their stock, the court overruling their claim of\r\npreference over the bondholders and creditors. The second preferred\r\nstockholders have received securities which, after payment of the\r\nassessment, net about $70 per share, at the market price, and at times\r\nover $80 net could have been realized.\r\n\r\n(4) The common stockholders, instead of being wiped out, have received\r\ntheir common stock in the new company upon paying an assessment, the\r\nnet amount of which (because of the value of the securities received\r\nfor such assessment) would not exceed $5 or $6.\r\n\r\n(5) The company saves its old charter for whatever value may be\r\nattached to it.[82]\r\n\r\nThis statement presents the favorable side of the picture. On the\r\nwhole, securityholders were tenderly handled, though the bondholders\r\nwere by no means paid off in full. And on the other hand, this very\r\ntenderness made a voluntary reorganization possible, whereby the\r\ncharter of the company was saved. The pertinent objections were from\r\nthe point of view of the company itself, and these were silenced by the\r\nincrease in earnings.\r\n\r\nSince reorganization the Baltimore & Ohio has been enjoying great\r\nprosperity. On a mileage operated, which was some 1800 miles greater\r\nin 1907 than in 1900,[83] it earned a return increased by over\r\n$40,000,000; while its income from dividends and interest mounted\r\nfrom less than half a million to over $3,000,000. Ton mileage figures\r\nwere about 11,300,000,000 in 1907 as against 6,800,000,000 in 1900;\r\npassenger mileage had grown from 459,000,000 to 723,000,000. This\r\nprosperity has but reflected the condition of the country at large, but\r\nthe Baltimore & Ohio has taken advantage of it in far-sighted fashion.\r\nNo less than $17,000,000 have been spent from earnings for additions\r\nand improvements between June 30, 1899, and June 30, 1907, not to\r\nmention maintenance of way expenditures which have ranged from about\r\n$1500 to over $2500 per mile of road operated. Besides the provision\r\nmade by the reorganization plan, $15,000,000 convertible debentures\r\nwere issued under date of March 1, 1901, for new construction and\r\nimprovements. There were authorized $40,000,000 of common stock in\r\nNovember, 1901, to go in part for improvements, and the bulk of\r\n$27,750,000 new common stock of 1906 will be applied to similar ends.\r\nAs a result the company’s equipment has largely increased, grades have\r\nbeen reduced, curves straightened, light rails replaced by heavy, and\r\nsubsidiary track increased. There were two miles of second, third,\r\nand fourth track and sidings for every three miles of main track in\r\n1900; there were three miles to every four in 1907. A considerable\r\nincrease in average freight train load has accordingly occurred. In\r\n1900 the average load was 366 tons; in 1907 it was 433.02. That this\r\nfigure has not still more greatly increased from the 406.53 tons of\r\n1901 is probably due to the somewhat greater proportion of manufactures\r\nhandled and to a considerable decrease in average distance hauled, and\r\nis compensated for by an increase of over one cent in the average rate\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nThe events of most vital importance in the Baltimore & Ohio’s recent\r\nhistory have been connected with its control. In September, 1898,\r\nPhilip D. Armour, Marshall Field, and Norman D. Ream, executors\r\nof the Pullman estate, together with James J. Hill of the Great\r\nNorthern, bought a large interest in the stock, though whether or\r\nnot sufficient to control no one knew. From statements by Mr. Cowen\r\nit would appear that the deal was somewhat similar to the earlier\r\none in which the Northern Pacific had been interested: that is, it\r\ninvolved the sale of Baltimore & Ohio stock to secure the good will\r\nof men strong enough to support the road in case of difficulty, and\r\ninfluential enough to open desirable connections or to modify the\r\nstringency of competition. “The recent transaction,” said Mr. Cowen,\r\n“has been the realization of my hopes about the future of the road.”\r\nIt was not Mr. Hill’s influence, however, that was destined to be\r\ndominant. By the end of the year rumors connected the Pennsylvania\r\nwith the purchase of an interest in the property, and the election\r\nof Mr. S. M. Prevost, third vice-president of that company, to a\r\ndirectorship, gave assurance of the truth of the reports. It was, of\r\ncourse, impossible to purchase actual control so long as the Baltimore\r\n& Ohio stock remained in trust; but the trustees seemed very ready to\r\naccord to new buyers that representation and influence to which their\r\nstock might give them claim. At the annual election in November, 1900,\r\nan additional representative of the Pennsylvania was elected to the\r\nboard, showing the probable increase of the Pennsylvania holdings, and\r\nthe following year an absolute majority was said to have been passed,\r\nthe shares held by Mr. Hill and his associates, and apparently sold\r\nto the Pennsylvania, being thought to contribute powerfully to that\r\nresult.[84] In May, Mr. Hill and Mr. Charles H. Tweed, chairman of the\r\nSouthern Pacific, resigned from the directorate, to be replaced by\r\ntwo further representatives of the Pennsylvania. In June, President\r\nCowen was replaced by Mr. S. F. Loree, fourth vice-president of the\r\nPennsylvania lines west of Pittsburg, and in August the voting trust\r\nwas dissolved.\r\n\r\nThe last step has been the sale of part of the Pennsylvania holdings\r\nto the Union Pacific system. It appears that the former’s interest in\r\nthe company was largely due to anxiety over the coal situation. Before\r\n1895 rates on bituminous coal had been depressed and demoralized.\r\nRebates had been freely given in spite of any agreements which could be\r\narranged. Under these circumstances the Pennsylvania had determined to\r\nbuy enough stock of the Chesapeake & Ohio, the Baltimore & Ohio, and\r\nthe Norfolk & Western companies to control the policies of these roads,\r\nand, through stock ownership in the Reading by the Baltimore & Ohio, to\r\ninfluence that company also.[85] Unfortunately for the project public\r\nattention became concentrated on the coal industry at this time because\r\nof the discovery of certain flagrant abuses, and it seemed wise for the\r\nPennsylvania to dispossess itself of a part of its stock.[86] The Union\r\nPacific was in the market with large resources derived from its sale of\r\nGreat Northern and Northern Pacific stock. It was out of the question\r\nfor the Pennsylvania to sell its shares to a competitor, but there\r\nwas less objection to a sale to Mr. Harriman, providing a reasonable\r\nportion should be retained. Accordingly, the Pennsylvania sold and the\r\nUnion Pacific interests bought, in October, 1906, some $39,540,600 in\r\nBaltimore & Ohio common and preferred stock, being in the neighborhood\r\nof half of the former’s holdings. This is the present situation of the\r\nproperty. The Baltimore & Ohio is independent, in the sense that it is\r\nnot controlled by any single interest, but large amounts of its stock\r\nare owned by its competitor, the Pennsylvania, and by its connection,\r\nthe Harriman system. On the whole the alliance with these interests\r\naugurs well for the future of the company.[87]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nERIE\r\n\r\n  Early history—Reorganization—Wall Street struggles—Financial\r\n    difficulties—Second reorganization—Development of coal business\r\n    —Extension to Chicago—Grant & Ward—Financial readjustment—New\r\n    York, Pennsylvania & Ohio—Third reorganization—Later history.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New York & Erie Railroad was organized in 1833 in the hope\r\nof bringing to the southern tier of counties in New York State a\r\nprosperity equal to that which the Erie Canal had secured for the\r\nnorthern tier. It was to run from New York or some suitable point in\r\nits vicinity to Lake Erie. A six foot gauge was adopted, partly because\r\nthe grades encountered were thought to require locomotives with more\r\npower than a narrower gauge could accommodate, and partly because it\r\nwas wished to make the road independent of any connection which might\r\nlead trade away from the city of New York.[88]\r\n\r\nThe events of the early years may be briefly dealt with. Difficulty\r\nwas experienced in getting subscriptions, and in 1836 the legislature\r\ngranted a loan of $3,000,000. An assignment was made in 1842, due to\r\nthe difficulty of getting the enterprise under way, which resulted in\r\nthe release of the company from liability to the state on condition\r\nthat it complete its line from the Hudson to Lake Erie by 1851.\r\nStockholders were to exchange two shares of old for one share of new\r\nstock, and a first mortgage of $3,000,000 was authorized.[89] In 1851\r\nthe line was completed to Dunkirk on Lake Erie, and the following year\r\nit reported a bonded indebtedness of $14,000,000, capital stock of\r\n$6,000,000, and floating debt to the amount of $3,080,000, or a total\r\nof $43,961 per mile of line; a high figure, but probably necessarily\r\nso in view of the difficult work to be performed. Although nominally\r\ncompleted, the troubles of the road were not over; and a precarious\r\nexistence was maintained only by the placing of additional loans in\r\n1852 and 1855, and by the aid of Daniel Drew on two distinct occasions.\r\nA war of rates with the New York Central aggravated the situation;\r\nheavy storms and ice floods in January, 1857, caused serious loss, and\r\nthe panic of that year, with the ensuing depression, proved more than\r\nthe road could stand. Proceedings were begun in 1859 by the trustees\r\nof the fourth mortgage, and in August a receiver was appointed.[90]\r\nThe wonder was that such action had been delayed so long. The income\r\nof the road had been so far short of meeting current expenses that\r\nclaims for labor, supplies, rents, and unpaid taxes, and judgments\r\nrendered against the company before the receivers were appointed, had\r\nmounted up to $741,510; while not only had interest on three mortgages\r\nfallen due in April, May, and June, but the principal of the second\r\nmortgage, amounting to $4,000,000, had matured. The settlement of\r\nclaims and the reorganization of the company were put in the hands\r\nof J. C. Bancroft Davis and Dudley S. Gregory. Since the earnings of\r\nthe road were at so low an ebb, wisdom would have seemed to dictate\r\nsome scaling of the charges to correspond. This did not enter into the\r\nviews of the trustees; instead, they proposed to give preferred stock\r\nfor all unsecured indebtedness, to extend the principal of the second\r\nmortgage coming due, to exchange old common stock for new, to levy an\r\nassessment of 2½ per cent on both classes of new stock, and with the\r\nproceeds of the assessment to pay all coupons in arrears. Provision\r\nwas made for the retirement of certain fourth mortgage bonds, and\r\nfor a sale under foreclosure of that mortgage. By the arrangement no\r\nsaving in fixed charges worth mentioning was secured; no sacrifice was\r\ndemanded of bondholders; and, save for the payment of assessments and\r\nthe (new) stock given for floating debt, the stockholder’s position was\r\nnot made worse. The scheme was an easy and temporary means of escape\r\nfrom an embarrassing position. Before the reorganization the bonds\r\noutstanding had amounted to $18,006,000, the stock to $11,000,000, and\r\nthe unsecured indebtedness to $8,504,000. After reorganization the\r\ntotals were: indebtedness, $17,953,000, and stock, $19,911,000 (of\r\nwhich $8,911,000 preferred); or a capitalization of $67,728 per mile.\r\nThe road was sold in 1862, and the Erie Railway took the place of the\r\noriginal New York & Erie Railroad Company.\r\n\r\nWith 1864 began the career of the Erie as a speculative Wall Street\r\nstock. Its large capitalization and the painful slowness with which\r\nits earnings grew kept the quotations of its shares normally at a\r\nlow figure and invited speculation; while the location of its lines\r\ntempted more serious efforts to obtain control. Up to 1867 Daniel Drew\r\nwas in power, while Commodore Vanderbilt spent his best efforts to\r\ndrive him out; after that date Jay Gould and Jim Fisk became more and\r\nmore prominent, and manipulated the Erie securities with enthusiastic\r\nregard to profits which they might derive both from the Erie Company\r\nitself and from operators who wished to speculate in its stock. In\r\nthe course of the abundant litigation to which Gould’s methods gave\r\nrise, various receivers were appointed; but the orders of appointment\r\nwere subsequently vacated, and the receiverships were nominal only.\r\nThe details of the Wall Street struggles have little interest for us\r\nhere.[91] But the result is of importance. In the eight years from 1864\r\nto 1872, when Gould was turned out of Erie by General Sickles and his\r\nEnglish backers, the bonded indebtedness of the company increased from\r\n$17,822,900 to $26,395,000, and the common stock from $24,228,800 to\r\n$78,000,000; in the one case a growth of 48 per cent and in the other\r\nof 221 per cent, at a time when the mileage increased 53 per cent and\r\nthe net earnings but 22 per cent.[92] No more disgraceful record exists\r\nfor any American railroad. The stock was not issued for the sake of\r\nimproving the road, and it was subsequently shown that the road was\r\nnot improved; but it was thrown upon the market at critical times in\r\nsupport of bear operations by the Erie managers, while portions of\r\nit, on at least one occasion, were bought back with the funds of the\r\ncompany to aid speculation for a rise. The result was to ruin the\r\ncredit of the Erie, and to make it the favorite tool of cliques of\r\ngamblers. The increase in bonds occasioned an unmistakable increase in\r\nfixed charges, which rose from 20 per cent of gross earnings in 1864\r\nto 25 per cent in 1871, 21 per cent in 1872, and 30 per cent in 1873,\r\nwhile the purchase of worthless bonds of subsidiary roads, such as the\r\nBoston, Hartford & Erie, lessened the assets without disclosing the\r\nreal position to the casual observer.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 the control of Erie was taken from Gould through a vigorous\r\ncampaign managed by General Daniel E. Sickles, and an “eminently\r\nrespectable” board of directors was elected. Temporary relief was\r\nobtained from the use of $6,000,000, available from an issue of bonds\r\npreviously approved,[93] and dividends, first on the preferred and\r\nthen on both preferred and common stock were declared. Unfortunately\r\nthe dividends were not earned; and this fact, which was suspected\r\nfrom the previous record of the company and the marvel of its so\r\nearly restoration to a dividend basis, was shown in the statements of\r\nex-Auditor S. H. Dunan, who resigned in March, 1874, alleging that the\r\naccounts had been falsified to suit the company’s purposes, and that\r\nhe was unwilling any longer to be a party thereto.[94] Investigations\r\nconducted by representatives of English bondholders showed that in\r\nthe three years ending in September, 1875, the profits of the road\r\nhad been $1,008,775 instead of $5,352,673 as stated in the company’s\r\naccounts; and the severity of this finding was scarcely mitigated by\r\nthe conclusion that in the opinion of the committee the dividends on\r\nthe preferred stock at least were justified by the books.[95] At the\r\nsame time the report of Captain Tyler, another English representative,\r\nlaid emphasis on the necessity for a change of gauge, a double track,\r\nimprovements in gradient, fresh extensions and connections, and other\r\nsimilar matters.\r\n\r\nThe real position of the company at the time was shown but too well\r\nby the frequency of strikes upon its road. Thus in February, 1874,\r\na strike of freight brakemen on the Susquehanna division broke out,\r\ncaused principally by an order to discharge one of the brakemen from\r\neach freight crew, leaving only three on a train; and at the same time\r\nthere was a strike of the switchmen on some of the divisions owing to a\r\ndecrease in pay. In March occurred a serious strike among the employees\r\nof the road in Buffalo, mainly on account of irregularity and delay in\r\npayment of wages, and, finally, in April, there was trouble both in\r\nthe Susquehanna shops and in the Jersey City freight yard over this\r\nsame cause. The indications afforded by these troubles were borne out\r\nby the figures of the annual reports. The gross earnings of 1874 were\r\n$1,413,708 less than those of 1873, while the decrease in operating\r\nexpenses was so slight as to reduce net earnings by nearly the same\r\namount. If, now, there is deducted from the net earnings of the years\r\n1871–3, inclusive, the sum which the London accountants declared to\r\nhave been improperly reported as profits, there results an average of\r\n$4,175,699 net; or less than the net earnings for either 1864, 1865, or\r\n1866, although the average charges for the years mentioned exceeded the\r\naverage of the earlier period by $1,769,060 each year. These figures\r\nexclude the influence of the panic of 1873, which, as has been seen,\r\ncaused a still further falling off in the earnings of the company. It\r\nwas a time, moreover, when the Erie could not be content to sit still\r\nand wait, for competition was daily becoming more severe. By 1874\r\nthe Baltimore & Ohio, the New York Central, and the Pennsylvania had\r\nconnections with Chicago, and the Erie was competing with them for\r\nbusiness by means of traffic agreements with connecting lines. The\r\nnext decade was to see the bitterest rate wars that the country has\r\never known; and the Erie, with its exceptional gauge and single track,\r\nwas to compete with rivals of normal gauge, who were adding third and\r\nfourth tracks to the two which they already possessed. The one bright\r\nspot was the development of the coal traffic, which in 1874 formed the\r\ngreatest item of the Erie’s tonnage, and was in a measure apart from\r\nthe competition of other lines.\r\n\r\nSuit was brought in July, 1874, for the appointment of a receiver.\r\nThe complaint reviewed alleged improper acts of the management in\r\ndeclaring dividends, in buying Buffalo, New York & Erie stock and\r\nsundry coal lands, and in issuing the new $30,000,000 mortgage before\r\nmentioned.[96] In October the Attorney-General of New York instituted\r\nsuit on nominally the same grounds; not, as he explained, in the\r\nexpectation that the appointment of a receiver would be required,\r\nbut in order that this action might be taken if the conduct of the\r\ndirectors should make it necessary. Still other suits were begun before\r\nthe year was out.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the management was changed. Whether or not Mr. Watson,\r\nwho had been president since 1872, had done all humanly possible to\r\nset the Erie on its feet, his administration was not unnaturally in\r\nbad odor after the charges of Dunan and the report of the London\r\naccountants, to say nothing of the admittedly low earnings for the\r\nyear 1874. An attempt was made to secure the very best man possible\r\nfor the presidency, and to support him in necessary reforms, in the\r\nhope of some different results from those with which securityholders\r\nhad become familiar. The man for the place was thought to be Mr. H. J.\r\nJewett, a railroad man then in Congress from Ohio; and this gentleman\r\nwas accordingly secured at an extremely liberal salary. Soon after his\r\nelection a ten per cent cut in salaries was decreed, and an examination\r\nof the accounts of the stations along the line in behalf of the company\r\nwas begun. It was too late, however, for the company. The business\r\nof the last of 1874 and first of 1875 was poor; floods in the spring\r\ndamaged the property of the road, and rumors of a receivership were\r\nrife. On May 22 a private meeting of stockholders in New York passed\r\nresolutions to the effect that the borrowing of money by the sale of 7\r\nper cent bonds at 40 cents on the dollar, and other means adopted by\r\nthe Watson administration, would inevitably result in bankruptcy; that\r\nsound interest required that the money needed to pay interest should\r\nbe raised by an assessment on the stockholders, and that the directors\r\nshould be thereby requested to open books to examination, and to\r\ninvite stockholders to contribute voluntarily a sum sufficient to keep\r\nthe company from immediate failure.[97] The proposal showed a proper\r\nspirit, but was impracticable. Four days later Mr. Jewett was appointed\r\nreceiver on application of representatives of the Attorney-General and\r\nof the Railroad.[98]\r\n\r\nThis was the second receivership which the Erie had had to face, and\r\nthe situation was materially worse than at the previous failure.\r\nAccording to the statement of President Jewett the funded indebtedness\r\nin May, 1875, amounted to $54,394,100, and the fixed charges to\r\n$5,059,828; while the net earnings for the previous nine months had\r\ndecreased 13.4 per cent from the corresponding period for the previous\r\nyear, and a serious deficit was in view. Temporary measures of relief\r\nhad served but to drag the company further into the mire;[99] and,\r\nmost important of all, the causes for the existing difficulties\r\nwere of a permanent nature, so that the future gave promise of still\r\nharder conditions than had existed in the past. What was needed was a\r\nreorganization which should undo the evil work of Gould, Fisk, Drew,\r\nand their associates, and which should secure the margin of surplus\r\nearnings which the reorganization of 1859–62 had failed to provide.\r\nPerhaps the chief difficulty lay in the fact that the men who were\r\nresponsible for the increased capitalization were not at all those on\r\nwhom the brunt of reconstruction would fall; for while the managers\r\nof the road had been Americans, the gullible investors had been\r\nEnglishmen; and it was reported that much of the watered stock of the\r\nGould régime had been unloaded on the English market.\r\n\r\nCommittees sprang up promptly. The most important of them were the\r\nEnglish committees of bond- and stockholders, soon consolidated under\r\nthe chairmanship of Sir Edward Watkin. On August 7, Sir Edward left\r\nEngland on a visit of inspection, accompanied by Mr. Morris, counsel\r\nfor the bondholders. Conference with the board of directors and with\r\nPresident Jewett followed, and a provisional scheme of adjustment was\r\ndecided upon. In his report to his English constituents Sir Edward\r\noutlined the results. Current indebtedness, said he, was $42,180,075;\r\nestimated net revenues for the year ending in June last were\r\n$3,715,609; operating expenses had been for that year 79 per cent, due\r\nlargely to the cost imposed by exceptional gauge, while the chief lines\r\nwith which the Erie competed showed proportions of only from 60 to 66\r\nper cent. Out of fourteen branches only three showed a profit above\r\nrentals, and pay-rolls had ordinarily been months in arrears. These\r\nfacts were familiar; the remedy proposed was unfortunately familiar as\r\nwell. “Let it be hoped,” said this English financier, “that the bond-\r\nand stockholders will have the courage now to submit to a period of\r\nself-denial, and will consent to pay their debts and complete essential\r\nobligations out of available net profits, the bondholders receiving\r\nin place of cash such equitable obligations, realized out of surplus\r\nrevenue in the future, as each, according to right of priority, may\r\njustly expect.”[100] What could this have meant save an issue of stock\r\nor income bonds for coupons falling due, with the result of adding\r\nto the unwieldy capitalization of the road instead of reducing it as\r\nshould have been done! For the rest, Sir Edward Watkin concluded with\r\nMr. Jewett the following arrangement:\r\n\r\n(1) Three nominees of the bond- and stockholders’ committee proposed by\r\nWatkin were to take seats in the Erie board;\r\n\r\n(2) Mr. Morris was to be associated with counsel for the receiver and\r\nfor the company, and was to be regarded and treated as one of the\r\nprofessional agents and officers of the undertaking;\r\n\r\n(3) Mr. Jewett was to transmit a memorandum of his views on\r\nreorganization;\r\n\r\n(4) Net earnings were to be retained for a while, and bondholders\r\nwere to have a voice in their expenditure. Thus a vote was to be\r\ntaken under the charge of the stock- and bondholders’ committee in\r\nLondon on the constitution of a committee of consultation, consisting\r\nof representatives of each class of bondholders and of preferred\r\nand ordinary stock, and that committee was to designate a special\r\nrepresentative whose consent and approval were to be taken by Mr.\r\nJewett in the expenditure of net earnings;\r\n\r\n(5) Monthly reports of actual earnings and expenditures, together\r\nwith reports from the president and receiver, were to be regularly\r\ntransmitted to the office of the committee in London;\r\n\r\n(6) Bond- and stockholders were to be urged to give power of attorney\r\nand proxies to Watkin, or to such other person or persons as the above\r\nrepresentatives of the bond- and stockholders should designate;\r\n\r\n(7) Any scheme of reorganization was to include a provision giving\r\nbondholders a voting power.\r\n\r\nOn the above resolutions Jewett, with his board, and Watkin, with\r\nhis committee, agreed to coöperate.[101] Under the circumstances the\r\nincreased power given the bondholders was both a natural and a just\r\ndemand, and it is probable that Mr. Jewett’s prompt acquiescence in it\r\nhad something to do with Sir Edward’s advice to the securityholders “to\r\nrely on the honor, as I feel you may also upon the anxious labors and\r\nfull experience of the President and Receiver.”\r\n\r\nThe report did not go uncriticised. It was pointed out, first, that\r\na majority of English proprietors could not unhesitatingly share the\r\nconfidence expressed in Mr. Jewett; second, that the first mortgage\r\nbondholders were well secured, and would surely refuse to fund their\r\nindebtedness; and third, that the payment of the floating debt,\r\naccording to the Watkin plan, would simply create another debt of equal\r\nor greater amount due to the bondholders whose coupons were not paid.\r\nThe only sound way, said a committee of bondholders in Dundee in a\r\nletter to the Watkin Committee, is resolutely to shun an accumulation\r\nof mortgage liabilities on the one hand, and on the other to give\r\nincreased reality to the bonds and stocks of the company already\r\nexisting as items in capital account, _i. e._ an assessment on the\r\nstock and a sweeping reduction in the interest on the bonds secured by\r\nthe second mortgage:—the first mortgage bonds are in different case—\r\nthey represent investment of cash instead of mere water, and even if\r\nforeclosure is difficult, they have beyond question an absolutely good\r\nsecurity for the ultimate payment of both principal and interest.[102]\r\n\r\nIn September, 1875, a plan of reorganization was anonymously put\r\nforward as follows: Instead of assessment on the shareholders, it\r\nsuggested the issue of 50 per cent more common stock; one new share\r\nfor every two shares then existing. If a price of $25 per share could\r\nbe obtained a total of $10,000,000 cash would be thereby secured.\r\nBesides the new stock issued bond- and preference-holders were to\r\ncapitalize their interest for two years in bonds or shares bearing\r\ntheir present priorities. This funding should yield $8,000,000; and\r\nthe $18,000,000 in all obtained was to be expended on the road over\r\nthe next two years, during which period the new shares were to be paid\r\nup by half-yearly instalments. With the line furnished and equipped as\r\nproposed, continued this optimistic plan, the working expenses could be\r\nreduced from 79 per cent to 60 per cent, and the traffic within three\r\nyears would be at least $24,000,000 per year, affording a net revenue\r\nof $9,600,000 per annum, sufficient to meet all bond and preference\r\nliabilities and to leave 3 per cent for the ordinary charges.[103] The\r\nall sufficient criticism to this plan was that it required too great a\r\ncombination of favorable circumstances to ensure its success. In some\r\nrespects, however, it was not unlike the plan ultimately adopted.\r\n\r\nTwo months later appeared a plan by Mr. John C. Conybeare, an English\r\nbondholder, which was superior to the foregoing in that it proposed an\r\nassessment, and made some slight provision for an ultimate reduction\r\nin fixed charges. Mr. Conybeare proposed to assess preferred stock\r\n$11 and common stock $9. Payment of the assessment was not to be\r\ncompulsory, but was to have the effect of giving to the stock which did\r\npay a right to dividends before anything should be received by that\r\nwhich did not pay. Shares of the company by the plan would thus have\r\nranked as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) Preferred shares on which assessment had been paid, entitled to 7\r\nper cent dividends before any other dividends were paid.\r\n\r\n(2) Preferred shares on which no assessment had been paid, with rights\r\ninferior to the preferred A shares, but superior to the common shares.\r\n\r\n(3) Common stock on which assessment had been paid, entitled to 4 per\r\ncent before further dividend on the common.\r\n\r\n(4) Unprivileged, unassessed common stock which was to take what there\r\nwas left.\r\n\r\nIn addition there was to be a pre-preference 8 per cent stock, ranking\r\nbefore all the above, which was to be issued to exchange in part for\r\nsecond preferred and convertible bonds. First consolidated bonds and\r\nsterling bonds of 1865 were to accept one or two per cent of their 7\r\nper cent interest in bonds, secured perhaps by the coal property of\r\nthe company, while the second consolidated and the convertible gold\r\nbonds were to receive 4 per cent in gold and 3 per cent in the new\r\npre-preference stock as above. To the obvious possibility that the\r\nstockholders would refuse to pay an assessment the plan opposed no\r\nremedy. In this case the very moderate amount of interest funded would\r\nhave been the only relief secured.[104]\r\n\r\nThese plans were, however, but preliminary to the elaborate Watkin\r\nscheme which appeared in December. The most prominent feature herein\r\nwas, as previously indicated, the funding of coupons, both those\r\npast due and those to become due for a time into the future. Given\r\nnet earnings sufficient to meet fixed charges, the postponement of\r\ninterest by this plan would obviously have released revenue with which\r\nto make needed improvements on the road. This funding was to be,\r\nhowever, limited to the first consolidated 7s, convertible sterling\r\n6s, second consolidated 7s, and convertible gold 7s; the six earlier\r\nissues were to be left untouched. One permanent reduction was also to\r\nbe made, in that for the second mortgage and convertible 7s were to\r\nbe given two classes of ninety-year gold bonds: the first for 60 per\r\ncent of the principal, with interest at 6 per cent, and payable in\r\nbonds of the same class from the dates of default until March, 1877,\r\nand thereafter in gold; the second for 40 per cent of the principal,\r\ncarrying 4 per cent until 1881 and thereafter 5 per cent, payable\r\nonly out of net earnings. To start the company on its way and to\r\nmeet present obligations an assessment was proposed of three dollars\r\non the preferred and six dollars on the common stock, in return for\r\nwhich 5 per cent income bonds were to be given; while finally the\r\ndividends on the preferred stock were to be reduced from 7 to 6 per\r\ncent, and foreclosure was contemplated, so that the opposition of an\r\nirreconcilable minority might be more easily overcome.[105] According\r\nto the figures in the Watkin plan, the old and new capitalization and\r\ninterest compared as follows:\r\n\r\nThe amount of capital stock was unchanged.\r\n\r\n  _Total bonded indebtedness_    _Principal_    _Interest_\r\n\r\n  Before reorganization,         $54,394,100    $4,073,106\r\n  After reorganization,           61,330,241     4,139,240\r\n                                 -----------    ----------\r\n    Increase                      $6,936,141       $66,134\r\n\r\nIndebtedness on which interest was obligatory:\r\n\r\n                                 _Principal_    _Interest_\r\n\r\n  Before reorganization,         $54,394,100    $4,073,106\r\n  After reorganization,           46,634,134     3,316,238\r\n                                 -----------    ----------\r\n    Decrease                      $7,759,966      $756,868\r\n\r\nThe net earnings for 1874–5 had been $3,715,609, and those from 1871–3\r\ninclusive, with the deductions declared proper in the report of the\r\nLondon accountants, had averaged $4,175,699 each year, so that a safe\r\nmargin seemed to intervene. The extent of the margin depended, however,\r\non the fixed charges, such as rentals, over and above interest on the\r\nfunded debt; and although it was proposed to cancel burdensome leases\r\nand contracts the actual leeway after 1880 was to be very small indeed.\r\nTo speak briefly, the plan was definite but not sufficiently radical\r\nto meet conditions which were likely to arise. In counting upon the\r\nability of the company to spare considerable sums from revenue for\r\nimprovements during the next few years, it was leaning on a broken\r\nreed; in increasing the nominal amount of bonded indebtedness, it was\r\nmaking a step in the wrong direction; and by interposing additional\r\nclaims on earnings while leaving the volume of stock the same, it\r\ntook from the stockholders any very lively interest in the road’s\r\nfuture welfare. The plan was nevertheless accepted by the English\r\nsecurityholders, subject to such modifications as might afterwards be\r\nfound desirable.[106]\r\n\r\nThe next step was to obtain the unanimous acceptance of this Watkin\r\nscheme. Messrs. Robert Fleming and O. G. Miller were accordingly sent\r\nto New York in February, 1876, to consult with the officers of the\r\ncompany and the securityholders in America. No very vigorous interest\r\nwas taken on this side, but the Erie directors appointed a committee to\r\nconfer with the English representatives, and discussions took place for\r\nsomething over a month. The committee criticised the plan proposed from\r\nthe point of view of the stockholders; they maintained that it would\r\ndestroy all their interest in the property unless they made further\r\nsacrifices, which they were unable to do, and suggested that the\r\nfunding of from four to eight coupons by the first consolidated, gold\r\nconvertible, and second consolidated bonds was all that would be needed\r\nto put the road in a prosperous condition, provide for steel rails, and\r\nfor the narrowing of the gauge.[107] This was so plainly inadequate\r\nthat it is a matter of surprise that it was entertained by the English\r\ncommittee; and even they insisted that the stockholders agree to put a\r\nmajority of the $86,000,000 of stock in the hands of the bondholders as\r\na preliminary, and would do no more than lay the proposal before their\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\nOn their return home in April Messrs. Miller and Fleming stated that\r\nthe essential conditions to a successful reorganization were:\r\n\r\n(1) An effective control of the management by the real owners,—the\r\nbondholders;\r\n\r\n(2) The restoration of the equilibrium between the compulsory interest\r\ncharge on the mortgage debt and the minimum net earnings;\r\n\r\n(3) A change of gauge from 6 ft. to 4 ft. 8½ in.[108]\r\n\r\n“The foreclosure scheme of the committee” (Watkin plan), said they,\r\n“is certainly the soundest plan and would doubtless be preferred by\r\nthose shareholders who really care for the welfare of their property.”\r\nThen referring to the directors’ plan, “If it were possible to present\r\nto the bondholders the scheme of proceeding by amicable arrangement\r\nas practicable, and therefore as presenting a real alternative for\r\ntheir acceptance, we should suggest to you at the same time to lay the\r\noption before them. We feel, however, that that scheme can only be\r\nregarded as such an alternative when stockholders enough have signified\r\ntheir willingness to vest their shares in trustees on the footing\r\nof it, and so secure an effectual control to the bondholders for a\r\ncertain period. We must, therefore, content ourselves for the present\r\nwith suggesting that the committee should proceed with vigor in the\r\ndirection of foreclosure, at the same time inviting the stockholders\r\nto signify their willingness to vest their stock in trustees as above\r\nmentioned.”[109]\r\n\r\nThe suggestion of the directors was the last alternative plan proposed,\r\nand from April, 1876, the only question was how to perfect and carry\r\nthrough the Watkin plan. As eventually put forward, this differed\r\nin a few points from its form as earlier announced. The fundamental\r\nprinciple was still the funding of coupons of the first and second\r\nconsolidated and the convertible bonds. Of these the first consolidated\r\nmortgage and sterling 6 per cents were now to fund _alternate_ coupons\r\nfrom September 1, 1875, to September 1, 1879, instead of funding _all_\r\ncoupons to March 1, 1876, and receiving cash thereafter: and whereas\r\nin the earlier plan mortgage bonds of the same class had been given\r\nfor funded interest, the later plan created special issues of funded\r\ncoupon bonds, secured by deposit of the funded coupons, and bearing\r\nthe same interest as the first consolidated bonds themselves. A more\r\nserious difference appeared in the treatment of the second mortgage and\r\nthe gold convertibles. It will be remembered that it had been proposed\r\nin December, 1875, to exchange these for two classes of new bonds,\r\nof which 60 per cent were to bear interest at the rate of 6 per cent\r\nand 40 per cent were to consist of 4 per cent income bonds. The new\r\nplan did away with this permanent reduction in fixed charges. Instead,\r\nthe second consolidated and convertible gold bonds funded alternate\r\ncoupons from June 1, 1875, to December 1, 1879, and received a new 6\r\nper cent bond for the principal of their holdings, and funded coupon\r\n6 per cent bonds for the interest thus postponed; the new mortgage\r\nbonds not having the right of foreclosure until after default for six\r\nsuccessive interest periods (3 years). The funded coupon bonds were to\r\nbe funded at the existing rate of interest on the second consolidated\r\nand convertible bonds, _i. e._ 7 per cent, so that the reduction in\r\ninterest was compensated for by the greater volume of securities given;\r\nand both classes of these coupon bonds were to bear lower interest at\r\nfirst than that to which they would ultimately attain. The assessment\r\nproposed in 1875 was retained in 1876, except that stockholders were\r\ngiven the choice of paying $6 on common and $3 on preferred stock and\r\nobtaining therefor income bonds, or of paying $4 on common and $2\r\non preferred and receiving nothing but new stock, dollar for dollar\r\nfor their old.[110] One-half of the shares of the new company (after\r\nforeclosure) were to be issued in the name of one or more sets of\r\ntrustees, who were to hold them to vote on until a dividend had been\r\npaid on the preferred stock for three consecutive years. Provision was\r\nmade for an issue of $2,500,000 in prior lien bonds, to take precedence\r\nof the remainder of the second consols, the proceeds to be applied\r\nto capital requirements. Voting power was conferred on the first and\r\nsecond consols, funded income bonds, prior lien bonds, and income\r\nbonds, in all about $57,000,000; one vote to every $100 of bonds.[111]\r\nThe property of the company was to be foreclosed by or under the\r\ndirection of certain reconstruction trustees, for the choice of whom\r\ncareful provisions were inserted.\r\n\r\nDivested of all complications, what this reorganization plan proposed\r\nfor the salvation of the property was the funding of the coupons on\r\nfour classes of bonds from 1875 to 1879; the reduction of the interest\r\nto be paid on $25,000,000 second consolidated and convertible 7s one\r\nper cent per share; and the raising of a certain amount of cash by\r\nassessment upon the stockholders; while it dropped the one point of the\r\nearlier plan which might have given a key to the solution of the whole\r\nproblem, viz. the exchange of mortgage and income bonds for the old\r\nsecond consolidated in the ratios respectively of 60 per cent and of 40\r\nper cent. When we remember the desperate straits to which the company\r\nhad been reduced, the permanent relief seems slight enough; and given\r\nthe fact, which proved but too true, that the net earnings were to fall\r\noff until the road was little more than able to meet the alternate\r\ncoupons which it was obliged to pay in cash, it appears to have been\r\nnothing at all. If we suppose no changes to have occurred in capital\r\naccount between 1878 and 1883 save those provided for in the plan of\r\nreorganization itself, a comparison of the two periods would have stood\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  _Before reorganization_       _Principal_   _Interest_\r\n\r\n  Sterling convertible 6s,       $4,457,714     $267,463\r\n  First consolidated 7s,         12,076,000      845,320\r\n  Convertible 7s,                10,000,000      700,000\r\n  Second consolidated 7s,        15,000,000    1,050,000\r\n                                -----------   ----------\r\n                                $41,533,714   $2,862,783\r\n  Old Mortgages,                 13,155,500      921,062\r\n  Guaranteed bonds, etc.,         6,003,360      449,411\r\n                                -----------   ----------\r\n                                $60,692,574   $4,233,256\r\n      Rentals,                                   742,226\r\n                                              ----------\r\n                                              $4,975,482\r\n\r\n  _After December 1, 1883_      _Principal_   _Interest_\r\n\r\n  Consolidated 7s,              $20,005,794   $1,400,405\r\n  Consolidated 6s,               33,516,666    2,011,000\r\n                                -----------   ----------\r\n                                $53,522,460   $3,411,405\r\n  Old bonds,                     13,155,500      921,062\r\n  Guaranteed bonds, etc.,         6,003,360      449,411\r\n  Rentals,                                       742,226\r\n                                -----------   ----------\r\n                                $72,681,320   $5,524,104\r\n  Total before reorganization    60,692,574    4,975,482\r\n                                -----------   ----------\r\n      Increase,                 $11,988,746     $548,622\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that this reorganization plan contemplated an immediate\r\nincrease in the cumbrous capitalization of the company to the amount\r\nof nearly $12,000,000, and an eventual increase in fixed charges of\r\nover $500,000. It offered no reasonable assurance that the solvency of\r\nthe company could be maintained under the average conditions existing\r\nin the past, and left no margin for contingencies of any kind. The\r\ntrouble lay in the unwillingness of bondholders to sacrifice any part\r\nof their holdings to meet difficulties caused largely by inflation over\r\nwhich they had had no control. This reluctance was natural,—it should\r\nhave been met, however, by the realization that the question was now\r\nof the future and not of the past, and that the best interests of the\r\nbondholders themselves demanded a reconstruction sufficiently radical\r\nto leave no doubt of the ability of the new company to pay its debts.\r\n\r\nThe plan adopted, foreclosure was in order, and suits which had been\r\nbegun as early as 1875 were taken up and pushed. In November, 1877,\r\na decree of foreclosure under the second consolidated mortgage was\r\nobtained, appointing a referee to conduct the sale, and providing for\r\nthe sale of the road to representatives of the bondholders in case\r\nthey made the highest bid. The opposition, which had not been able to\r\nprevent the approval of the plan, now appeared with a multiplicity\r\nof suits to prevent its consummation. In January, 1878, demands were\r\nmade to secure a re-accounting from the receiver, and the reopening\r\nof an earlier suit of the people against the Erie which had been\r\npreviously discontinued. On January 18 the postponement of the sale\r\nto March 25 was obtained. On January 19 a suit demanded the removal\r\nof Receiver Jewett, making sweeping charges of fraud; and on January\r\n30, in still other proceedings, Mr. Jewett was arrested on a charge of\r\nperjury for swearing to incorrect statements in the annual report to\r\nthe state engineer;—a culmination as disgraceful as it was absurd.\r\nIn February a suit in Orange County, New York, demanded the removal\r\nof the receiver, and the appointment of a special receiver during the\r\npendency of the action, with an injunction to prevent the sale of the\r\nroad. In March a petition of one Isaac Fowler, a stockholder, for\r\npermission to examine the company’s books, was granted; argument was\r\nheard on the petition of James McHenry to intervene in the foreclosure\r\nsuits and further to postpone the sale; the application of Albert Betz\r\nand others to be made parties was granted; and postponement of sale to\r\nApril 24 obtained. Last of all, on April 23 and 24, arguments in behalf\r\nof John F. Brown and F. W. Isaacson were heard, asking for postponement\r\nto a still later date. The litigation availed nothing. Judge Potter\r\nin the Brown suit held that the courts could relieve against any\r\ninjustice occasioned by the sale, and on April 24 the property of the\r\nErie Railway was sold for $6,000,000 under foreclosure of the second\r\nconsolidated mortgage.[112] The new corporation formed to take over the\r\nrailroad was called the New York, Lake Erie & Western Railroad Company,\r\nand had its articles of incorporation regularly filed at the office of\r\nthe Secretary of State. Mr. Jewett was elected president. In May the\r\nreceiver was discharged,[113] and a new stage in the history of the\r\nroad began.\r\n\r\nFor about seven years the Erie was to be free from the necessity for\r\nfurther reorganization. This result, unexpected from the nature of\r\nthe adjustment of 1878, was due to the vigorous policy of Mr. Jewett,\r\nfirst, in developing the coal traffic for which the Erie was well\r\nlocated; second, in improving the condition of the road; and third, in\r\nsecuring connections with Chicago.\r\n\r\nFor some time the Erie had been a considerable carrier of coal and a\r\nlarge owner of coal lands as well. In 1877, the first year in which the\r\nfigures were separated in the annual report, roughly 273,000,000 out\r\nof 1,113,000,000 ton miles reported, or something over one-quarter,\r\nwere due to the carriage of coal; and $2,697,776 out of a total of\r\n$10,647,807 of the freight earnings came from that business. The\r\nlands owned by the company consisted of 8000 acres in fee, and large\r\ntracts in leasehold and mining rights in the anthracite territory in\r\nthe northeast corner of Pennsylvania; together with 14,000 acres in\r\nfee and 13,000 acres of mining rights in the bituminous territory in\r\nthe northwest portion of the state.[114] Mr. Jewett felt that this\r\nproperty could be made of great value to the road, and it was under\r\nhis administration as receiver that steps were taken to extend the\r\nholdings of bituminous land, and to control branch roads leading into\r\nthe district. The result appeared in a remarkable extension of the\r\ncompany’s business. While the total freight ton mileage from 1878 to\r\n1884 increased 103 per cent, the ton mileage of coal increased 190\r\nper cent, or nearly tripled; and while the gross earnings on ordinary\r\nfreight grew from $7,950,031 to $11,687,520, those on coal increased\r\nfrom $2,697,776 to $5,437,000. At the same time McKean County, directly\r\nnorth of the coal lands, and containing large tracts purchased by the\r\nErie in the course of its other negotiations, turned out to be an\r\nabundant oil-producing district, and made the Bradford branch, which\r\ntapped it, Erie’s most valuable collateral property.[115]\r\n\r\nIt was partly because of the success of the policy in respect to coal\r\nlands that the Erie was enabled to spend large sums in the improvement\r\nof its road. In the six years from 1878 to 1883 the company put nearly\r\n$14,000,000 into improvements of the road, property and equipment, and\r\nof this about one-half was paid out of surplus earnings. In December,\r\n1883, alone, $304,565 were spent, and in the three succeeding months\r\nnearly double that amount; making a total of nearly $1,000,000 in the\r\nfour months previous to April, 1884. The money went toward reducing\r\ngrades, straightening curves, increasing weight of rails, etc.,\r\nincluding the completion of a third rail to Buffalo by which the\r\nserious disadvantage of an exceptional gauge was removed. Its result\r\nwas seen in the decrease in the ratio of operating expenses from 75.13\r\nin 1875 and 77.16 in 1876 to 64.78 in 1883; and in the rise of net\r\nearnings per ton mile from .251 cents to .261 cents, while the gross\r\nearnings per ton mile decreased from 1.209 cents to .780 cents. No\r\npolicy which the Erie managers pursued met a more crying need, and none\r\ndid so much toward maintaining the solvency of the company.\r\n\r\nThe project of controlling a line of their own to Chicago was brought\r\nactively to the attention of the Erie managers by the danger of being\r\ncut off from a connection with that city. The original line of the Erie\r\nhad run to Dunkirk on Lake Erie, from which a branch to Buffalo had\r\nsoon been built. For western traffic the Erie had had to rely largely\r\non the Atlantic & Great Western (later the New York, Pennsylvania &\r\nOhio), which connected with the main line at Salamanca, New York, and\r\nextended by 1884 west to Dayton, Ohio. In 1857 the Erie first leased\r\nthis property. Placed in receivers’ hands in 1869, the Atlantic & Great\r\nWestern was re-leased to the Erie on January 1, 1870; sold July 1,\r\n1871, it was again leased to the Erie in May, 1874, only to enter upon\r\na new receivership on December 9 of that year. The persistent attempt\r\nto control the road showed the value which the Erie placed upon it,\r\nand in fact it was invaluable as a link in a prospective line to the\r\nWest. Even while the leases were in force, however, the Erie lacked\r\nthat connection of its own with Chicago which seemed necessary to make\r\nit a successful competitor for trunk-line business. In 1882 it was\r\nforwarding passengers over not less than five different routes, over\r\nno one of which could it feel assured of the continuance of contracts\r\nof a favorable nature. In 1881 Mr. Jewett relieved the situation by\r\nacquiring control of the franchise of the Chicago & Atlantic Railway,\r\nextending from Marion, Ohio, on the line of the New York, Pennsylvania\r\n& Ohio towards Chicago, and soon after he entered into a contract\r\nwith certain private parties for construction of the road. In 1883 he\r\nexecuted a new lease of the New York, Pennsylvania & Ohio, which he\r\nhoped would secure for the Erie permanent control of the property, and\r\nabout the same time (1882) he purchased a controlling interest in the\r\nstock of the Cincinnati, Hamilton & Dayton, which extended the Erie\r\nsystem to the important city of Cincinnati. These operations put the\r\nErie upon a footing which was secure so long as the obligations which\r\nthey entailed could be met, and showed a broad-minded appreciation of\r\nstrategic necessities. The terms of the arrangement with the Chicago\r\n& Atlantic were as follows: For the construction of the road the Erie\r\nagreed to give to the directors the entire proceeds of the mortgage\r\nbonds of that branch ($6,500,000), and its entire capital stock\r\n($10,000,000); making an aggregate of $61,710 per mile of line. The\r\nproceeds were, however, to be deposited with the president of the New\r\nYork, Lake Erie & Western in trust, together with certain subsidies\r\nwhich had been voted by the counties and townships along the line, and\r\nupon him was to devolve the duty of seeing to the proper application\r\nthereof; and besides this, 90 per cent of the stock was to be deposited\r\nand an irrevocable proxy given thereon for the thirty years’ life\r\nof the bonds.[116] The obligation which the Erie assumed amounted\r\nin practice to guaranteeing that the road should be constructed for\r\nthe sum provided, and that interest on the bonds should be paid. In\r\nleasing the New York, Pennsylvania & Ohio the Erie involved itself\r\nmore heavily. As lessee it agreed to pay the minimum sum of $1,757,055\r\nyearly (the net earnings of 1882); the actual rental to be 32 per\r\ncent of all gross earnings up to $6,000,000 and 50 per cent of all\r\ngross earnings above $6,000,000, until the average of the whole rental\r\nshould be raised to 35 per cent, or until the gross earnings should\r\nbe $7,200,000. If 32 per cent of the gross earnings should ever be\r\nless than the $1,757,055 to be paid yearly, then the deficiency was\r\nto be made up, without interest, out of the excess in any subsequent\r\nyear. Out of the rental the New York, Pennsylvania & Ohio was to pay\r\nthe interest on its prior lien bonds, the rentals of its leased lines,\r\nthe expenses of maintaining its organization in Europe and America,\r\nand for five years a sum of $260,000 each year to the car trust.[117]\r\nFinally, in purchasing the Cincinnati, Hamilton & Dayton, the Erie gave\r\nto the holders of the $2,000,000 of stock which it bought beneficial\r\ncertificates to the amount of $1,500,000, on which it agreed to make\r\ngood any failure of the Cincinnati company to pay 6 per cent per annum.\r\n\r\nBut though the Erie managers did their best with the conditions which\r\nthey were called upon to face, they were unable to hold the company\r\nup under the enormous capitalization and heavy charges left by the\r\nreorganization of 1874–8, at a time when rate wars were sapping its\r\nresources, and when contracts which it was being forced to make\r\nwere entailing an annual loss.[118] In spite of the declaration of\r\nsufficient dividends on the comparatively small amount of preferred\r\nstock to terminate the voting trust, it is certain that for most of\r\nthe years from 1874 to 1884 the solvency of the road was a precarious\r\nmatter, and that there never was a time when any considerable falling\r\noff in earnings or any severe shock to its credit would not have driven\r\nit to the wall.\r\n\r\nSuch a shock was preparing in the early months of 1884. For some weeks\r\nbefore the last of April there had been a tendency for the quotations\r\nof Erie securities to fall; no reason was assigned, but it was hinted\r\nthat default might be made in the payment of the June interest on\r\nthe second consols, and that a receivership was not unlikely. This\r\nweakness was accompanied, and perhaps accentuated, by a strike of\r\nthe brakemen on the New York, Pennsylvania & Ohio in consequence of\r\nan order reducing the number of brakemen on each train from three\r\nto two. The truth of the matter came out in May, when the failure\r\nof the Wall Street firm of Grant & Ward both precipitated a stock\r\nexchange panic and laid bare the straits to which the company had\r\nbeen reduced. Investigation showed that a large floating debt had\r\nbeen piling up for four principal purposes: First, advances to the\r\nChicago & Atlantic Railroad; second, advances for coal mines; third,\r\nadvances for improvements on the Hudson River at Weehawken; fourth,\r\nequipment instalments.[119] Attempts to raise funds to cover the debt\r\nhad resulted in the negotiation of promissory short time notes with\r\nthe firm of Grant & Ward, for which $2,500,000 of Chicago & Atlantic\r\nsecond mortgage bonds had been deposited as security. The company had\r\nbeen attracted to Grant & Ward by their offer to purchase and dispose\r\nof Chicago & Atlantic bonds at a price 15 per cent above that offered\r\nby any other parties;[120] and had trusted so implicitly in their\r\nintegrity as to deposit notes and collateral for its short time loans\r\ndetached and independent, one from the other, so that Grant & Ward\r\nwere able to, and did, fraudulently raise money upon them to an amount\r\nmuch larger than the advances they had made. The losses entailed by\r\nthe transaction were serious, and the blow to Erie’s credit was even\r\nmore severe. The floating debt which had been so hard to carry became\r\ndoubly menacing now that the possibility of further short time loans\r\nwas practically cut off; and to cap the climax, the earnings for the\r\nfirst half of the year 1884 showed an unusually large decrease with\r\nthe cessation of the fall business. Under these circumstances it was\r\nthe part of wisdom to take advantage of every loophole of escape, and\r\nthe peculiar provisions of the second consolidated mortgage, denying\r\nto these bonds the right of immediate foreclosure in case of default,\r\nwere turned to for relief. It will be remembered that by the terms of\r\nthe reorganization of 1878 no right of action was to accrue to the\r\nsecond mortgage bondholders until on each of six successive due dates\r\nof coupons (three years) some interest secured by the second indenture\r\nshould be in default. This being the case the Erie directors decided\r\nto pass the June interest on these bonds. “As a general rule,” said\r\nthey in a circular, “the business and earnings of the company are much\r\nless for the first half than for the last half of the year. The falling\r\noff in earnings for the first six months of the previous year has\r\nbeen unusually large. The coupons of the second consolidated mortgage\r\nbonds are due and payable on the first of June prox.... Under ordinary\r\ncircumstances the board might at the present as on the former occasions\r\nprovide to some extent for the deficit of the first six months, relying\r\non the usual increase in earnings of the last half of the year, but in\r\nthe present depressed condition of the business of the country and of\r\nthe earnings of this company, as well as of others, the board does not\r\nfeel at liberty to deal with anything but the business and earnings as\r\nnow ascertained, and therefore deems it wise to accept the provisions\r\nof the mortgage as the lawful rule for their government in the existing\r\nemergency....”[121]\r\n\r\nHowever necessary the action, the bondholders of the company could not\r\nhave been expected to receive it quietly; and naturally again, the\r\nindignation was intense among the English securityholders, to whom,\r\nmore than to any one else, the existing situation was due. In June,\r\n1884, a meeting of stockholders of the company was held in London, at\r\nwhich much complaint was made of the fall in value of the securities\r\nof the company, and an inquiry into the management was demanded. A\r\ncommittee was appointed, and two of its members, Messrs. Powell and\r\nWestlake, landed in New York July 15, with protestations of a friendly\r\nspirit toward all concerned. The situation was not encouraging. The\r\nday before their arrival President Jewett had offered his resignation,\r\nand the directors were busy selecting his successor; a large floating\r\ndebt was demanding most vigorous attention, and confidence in the\r\ncompany was at a low ebb. Beyond a doubt the raising of a large amount\r\nof cash, $4,000,000 to $5,000,000, was a pressing necessity, and the\r\nEnglish representatives were anxious to make it plain that at least a\r\nfair share of this should come from American as well as from English\r\nbondholders. Force of circumstances compelled them to give assurance\r\nthat the money would be raised, and this done, Mr. John King accepted\r\nthe position which Mr. Jewett professed himself ready to resign.\r\nPending the annual election Mr. King took the position of Assistant to\r\nthe President.\r\n\r\nOn their return to London Messrs. Powell and Westlake reported the\r\nfloating debt to be as follows:\r\n\r\n  Unpaid coupons, June 1, 1884,                             $1,007,922\r\n\r\n  Balance of actual and early maturing liabilities other\r\n  than the June 1 coupons over and above cash in hand and\r\n  money assets considered good and available,               $4,447,316\r\n\r\n“All the purposes, the expenditures on which have caused the floating\r\ndebt,” said they, “seem to us to have been in themselves wise and\r\npolitic, but the piling up of a large floating debt for even the\r\nbest of purposes is always more or less imprudent and dangerous.\r\nThe company’s credit might have borne the strain of the panic, but\r\nit was broken down by the Grant & Ward disaster, and the funding of\r\nits floating debt is now indispensable.... We have suggested to the\r\npresident and directors, and now recommend to the committee that an\r\neffort should be made without delay to raise a permanent loan on the\r\nsecurities available for a total of $5,000,000.”[122] This, it will be\r\nobserved, was the old remedy. Inability to meet current expenses was to\r\nbe removed by capitalizing the debts which this inability had caused.\r\n\r\nThe year 1885 was taken up with suits brought against the Erie by\r\ncertain of its branch lines. In February the directors of the Buffalo\r\n& Southwestern Company brought suit to recover $345,000 interest\r\ndefaulted during the previous January. The complaint alleged that the\r\nErie was insolvent, and asked that it be restrained from using the\r\ngross receipts of the road until the default should have been made\r\ngood. The Erie paid the back interest, but in July, after another\r\ndefault, an injunction was obtained forbidding it to divert any part\r\nof the earnings received or to be received from this property. It was\r\nrecited that on May 24, 1881, the Buffalo & Southwestern had been\r\nleased to the Erie for 35 per cent of the gross earnings, subject to\r\ncertain deductions; that the Erie had delayed payment of the rental\r\ndue in January, 1885, and had refused to pay that due in July, 1885,\r\nbut that it was still receiving the gross earnings of the plaintiffs’\r\nroad, and had applied these to the payment of its debts other than\r\nthe rentals of this road.[123] In November, after the Erie’s other\r\ntroubles were settled, the litigation was terminated by an agreement\r\nto reduce the Buffalo & Southwestern rental from 35 per cent to 27½\r\nper cent. Other suits arose, directly or indirectly, because of the\r\ncontrol which Mr. Jewett maintained as trustee of the stock of the\r\nChicago & Atlantic and the Cincinnati, Hamilton & Dayton railways even\r\nafter his resignation from the Erie Company. On the one hand President\r\nKing was anxious to repossess himself of these important branches\r\nfor the Erie, and on the other Mr. Jewett was not disinclined to do\r\nwhat damage he could to the managers who had succeeded in supplanting\r\nhim. In the matter of the Chicago & Atlantic Mr. Jewett gained the\r\nfirst victory in a temporary injunction forbidding the Erie to divert\r\ntraffic from this line contrary to contract. This injunction was\r\nsoon, however, substantially vacated, and President King in his turn\r\nobtained a decision that Jewett had been made trustee of the Chicago\r\n& Atlantic simply because he had been at the time vice-president of\r\nthe New York, Lake Erie & Western Railroad Company and could be relied\r\nupon to control the road as the western outlet of the Erie. A receiver\r\nwas subsequently appointed and the road reorganized as the Chicago &\r\nErie Railroad Company, the Erie agreeing to guarantee payment of its\r\nfirst mortgage bonds, and receiving in return the $100,000 of capital\r\nstock and $5,000,000 in income bonds, besides $2,000,000 first mortgage\r\nbonds which were in part payment of old advances.[124] In his action\r\nconcerning the Cincinnati, Hamilton & Dayton President King was less\r\nsuccessful; and Mr. Jewett was sustained in his refusal to deliver\r\nproxies for the stock held to the larger company. The result was to\r\nturn the Erie to the Big Four, upon which, instead of upon the Dayton\r\nroad, the management was for some time to rely for an entrance into\r\nCincinnati.\r\n\r\nDuring these various contests the suggestions of the English committee\r\nwere not lost to view, and in the latter part of 1885 they crystallized\r\ninto definite propositions. The floating debt then consisted of two\r\nparts: first, the defaulted coupons on the second consolidated bonds;\r\nand second, the current liabilities accumulated for the purposes before\r\ndescribed. The relief proposed was likewise in two parts, and involved\r\nthe issue of a 5 per cent mortgage, secured by deposit of the second\r\nconsolidated coupons maturing and to mature in June and December,\r\n1884, June, 1885, and June, 1886, and a 6 per cent mortgage upon the\r\nproperty of the Long Dock Company, comprising the valuable terminals of\r\nthe Erie at Jersey City.[125] The funding of the coupon issue proved\r\nsimplicity itself; the funded coupons were exchanged for bonds of the\r\nnew gold mortgage, which were to be redeemable at 105 at the pleasure\r\nof the company.[126] By the end of 1886 these bonds had been accepted\r\nby the holders of $32,982,500 of the outstanding $33,597,400 of the\r\nsecond consols, and $3,957,900 of them had been issued. Dealing with\r\nthe Long Dock Company was slightly complicated by the fact that 8000\r\nshares of that company were pledged as part security for the issue of\r\nErie collateral bonds. To free them $800,000 in cash were deposited\r\nwith the trustee of the mortgage, which were in turn employed by him to\r\npay off $727,000 of the 6 per cent collateral bonds, thus reducing the\r\ninterest charge on that issue $43,620 per annum. This done, the Long\r\nDock Company extended the lease of its property and franchises to the\r\nErie to 1935 at a rental of $480,000 per annum, and contemporaneously\r\ntherewith placed a consolidated mortgage upon its property to secure\r\n$7,500,000 of 50-year 6 per cent gold bonds; of which $3,000,000\r\nwere reserved to retire existing indebtedness, and the proceeds of\r\n$4,500,000 were paid to the Erie for the cancellation of its floating\r\ndebt. The total result was to increase fixed charges by $270,000 of\r\ninterest at 6 per cent on the Long Dock bonds, and by $197,895 on\r\n$3,957,900 of the new funded 5s, less the reduction of $43,620 on\r\ncancelled collateral bonds; leaving a net increase of $424,275.[127]\r\nFor its ingenuity the scheme was to be admired; from any other point\r\nof view it was to be condemned as another example of that borrowing to\r\npay interest which had brought the Erie to its existing straits. The\r\nincapacity of the creditors of the company to realize that continued\r\nborrowing of money to pay current obligations was only to ensure\r\nrepeated bankruptcy seemed complete.\r\n\r\nAfter this new “salvation,” the Erie started once more on its laborious\r\nattempt to pay interest on its outstanding bonds. From 1887 to 1892\r\nthe business increased somewhat, and despite a decrease in the average\r\nreceipts per ton mile[128] a gain of about $4,700,000 in gross earnings\r\nwas secured; from which is to be deducted an increase of $310,996 in\r\nfixed charges, and of $4,076,111 in operating expenses.\r\n\r\nThe prohibition of pooling in 1887 affected the company unfavorably.\r\nPrevious to the passage of the Interstate Commerce Act the other lines\r\nhad been paying it an annual average of $42,500 on west-bound business\r\nfrom New York for shortages under the operation of the trunk-line pool,\r\nbesides about $88,000 annually on east-bound dead freight and $19,770\r\non live stock. These payments ceased when the Act was passed, although\r\na differential on west-bound traffic was subsequently allowed.[129]\r\nBut the leakage which was most apparent lay in the large rental and\r\nheavy operating cost of the New York, Pennsylvania & Ohio. It will\r\nbe remembered that the Erie had leased that road for 32 per cent of\r\nthe gross earnings when earnings were $6,000,000 or under, and 50 per\r\ncent when they should be above that figure. In 1887 this was amended\r\nso as to provide that for every increase of $100,000 over $6,000,000\r\nin the gross earnings the Erie should pay to the lessor an additional\r\none-tenth of one per cent of such gross earnings until the gross\r\nearnings should be $7,250,000, and the rental 33½ per cent, after which\r\nthe percentage was not to increase.[130] Under the old lease the Erie\r\nhad guaranteed to carry over the line 50 per cent of all its east-bound\r\nand 65 per cent of all its west-bound through traffic—under the new\r\nlease, these maxima were increased to 55 per cent and 70 per cent; but\r\neven this failed to make the branch road pay. Its grades were high,\r\nits equipment and sidings were limited, its cost of operation was well\r\nabove 68 per cent; and the increase in tonnage provided for emphasized\r\neach and every disadvantage. Up to 1893 the results of operations were\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n                                             _Loss_      _Profit_\r\n\r\n  First 5 months to Sept. 30,      1883                  $199,540\r\n  Twelve months ending Sept. 30,   1884     $270,281\r\n                                   1885      239,820\r\n                                   1886                    51,322\r\n                                   1887                    91,965\r\n                                   1888      343,911\r\n                                   1889      331,134\r\n                                   1890                    77,376\r\n                                   1891       19,586\r\n                                   1892      425,888\r\n                                   1893      197,106\r\n                                          ----------     --------\r\n                                          $1,827,726     $420,203\r\n      Net loss,                            1,407,523\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that the terms of the amended lease were in reality\r\nmore onerous than the contract which they succeeded, and that whatever\r\nthe value of the branch as a feeder, its operation involved large and\r\nfairly regular deductions from the net income of the parent line.\r\nEmphasis on these facts was laid in the annual reports, and frequent\r\ndemands were made that the New York, Pennsylvania & Ohio bring its\r\nroad up to the standard of like connections of through trunk lines.\r\nMeanwhile improvements were imperative on the Erie’s own lines: new\r\nequipment was needed, new rails and new motive power, and at the\r\nsame time surplus earnings were somewhat less. The directors adopted\r\nthe expedient of allowing current liabilities to accumulate, and put\r\n$8,496,572 into the road from October 1, 1884, to September 30, 1892,\r\nof which $3,351,977 represented surplus earnings, $2,375,400 increase\r\nin bonded indebtedness, and the balance floating debt. In the matter\r\nof traffic policy they paid particular attention to the coal business,\r\nwhich, however, lost ground as compared with other freight, and to\r\nthe local business, which it was the policy of the management to\r\nencourage. In 1890 the board declared that “the time had arrived when\r\nextraordinary expenditure for improvements and the necessities of the\r\nproperty were no longer necessary.”[131] In 1891 3 per cent on the\r\npreferred stock was paid, the first dividend since 1884.[132]\r\n\r\nFrom 1887 to 1893, with all its struggles, the Erie was continually on\r\nthe verge of failure. The capitalization in 1892 was at the enormous\r\ntotal of $163,607,485 on an operated mileage of 1698 miles, while\r\nfixed charges were $4993 per mile, and the available net revenue but\r\n$4830.[133] Given, with this condition, a gross floating debt which\r\namounted in 1892 to $9,163,166, and represented in a large measure\r\nthe inability of the company to make necessary repairs, no further\r\nexplanation is needed for the bankruptcy which soon took place.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1893 rumors were current that the Erie might be thrown into\r\nthe hands of a receiver. The reports were vigorously denied, but on\r\nJuly 25, nevertheless, on application of the company itself, Judge\r\nLacombe appointed President John King and Mr. J. G. McCullough as\r\nreceivers of the property. The measure was taken to avoid the sacrifice\r\nof collaterals deposited. “Within the last few weeks,” said President\r\nKing, “during the severe money stringency the floating debt of the\r\nErie ... became impossible of renewal, and in order not to sacrifice\r\nthe best interests of the company it was decided to place the road in\r\nreceivers’ hands, and preserve the system intact, and preserve and\r\ndevelop the transportation business for the company.”[134] The action\r\noccasioned no surprise, and there was even a disposition to praise\r\nthe management for having preserved the solvency of the company. “The\r\ncompany was bankrupt _de facto_ when it passed to its new control,”\r\nsays Mott, and “that the time when it must become bankrupt _de jure_\r\nwas held off so long was a striking demonstration of the tact and\r\nresourcefulness which the new _régime_ had been able to bring to\r\nbear in the management of the company’s unpromising affairs, and in\r\njudicious shifting and manipulating of the heavy burdens Erie bore upon\r\nits chafed and weary shoulders.”[135] What a receivership meant was a\r\nnew opportunity to put the company upon a genuinely sound foundation,\r\nby providing new capital to pay off the floating debt and to allow for\r\nfuture additions and improvements, and by getting fixed charges to a\r\npoint well within the road’s capacity to earn. We shall see what use\r\nwas made of the chance.\r\n\r\nThe matter of reorganization was set about at once. On January 1 a plan\r\nappeared, prepared, at least nominally, by a special committee chosen\r\nby the directors,[136] and backed by the well-known firms of Drexel,\r\nMorgan & Co. of New York and J. S. Morgan & Co. of London.[137] By\r\nits terms no mortgage senior to the second consolidated mortgage was\r\nto be disturbed save the first mortgage, which matured in 1897. The\r\nbonds to be dealt with were thus reduced to $41,481,048, besides which\r\nprovision had to be made for the floating debt and for future capital\r\nrequirements. The plan proposed to authorize a blanket mortgage of\r\n$70,000,000 at 5 per cent, of which $33,597,000 were to exchange at\r\npar for the 6 per cent second consolidated bonds and funded coupons\r\nthereof, $4,031,400 to exchange for the funded coupon bonds of 1885,\r\nand $508,008 for the income bonds. Of the balance, $6,512,800 were to\r\nbe reserved to settle with the old first lien and collateral trust\r\nbonds, $15,915,208 to supply capital requirements in the future, and\r\n$9,915,208 to be offered for subscription in order to pay the floating\r\ndebt. The new management did not conceive that these last bonds could\r\nbe sold to advantage in the general market, but imposed as a condition\r\nof the exchanges as above that second consols, funded coupon, and\r\nincome bonds should subscribe at 90 to the extent of 25 per cent\r\nof their holdings; hoping that the grant of the right of immediate\r\nforeclosure upon default would induce the second consols to come in.\r\nBoth these consols and the funded coupon bonds of 1885, it may be\r\nremarked, were to be kept alive and deposited with the trustee for the\r\nprotection of the new bonds. Stated in tabular form the distribution of\r\nsecurities was to be as follows:\r\n\r\n  To acquire the existing second consols,                    $33,597,400\r\n  To acquire the funded coupons of 1885,                       4,031,400\r\n  To acquire the income bonds,                                   508,008\r\n  For subscription as above,                                   9,915,208\r\n  To acquire the old reorganization first lien and\r\n    collateral trust bonds,                                    6,512,800\r\n  To be expended for construction, equipment, etc., not\r\n    to exceed $100,000 in any year, except that $500,000\r\n    might be used to acquire existing car trusts,             15,435,184\r\n                                                             -----------\r\n                                    Total,                   $70,000,000\r\n\r\nThe new mortgage was to cover the property of the New York, Lake Erie &\r\nWestern, including its leasehold of the New York, Pennsylvania & Ohio,\r\nand the capital stock of the Chicago & Erie Railroad.[138] There was\r\nto be no assessment, no syndicate to raise money, and no voting trust.\r\n\r\nThis plan was advanced as adequate to restore the prosperity of the\r\ncompany. Examination will show its weakness. It comprised two measures\r\nof relief: first, reduction of interest by one per cent on the second\r\nconsolidated bonds; second, the settlement of the floating debt. The\r\nfirst might be thought to have been the kernel of the plan, and the\r\nreduction in fixed charges the principal thing aimed at. That it was\r\nnot is shown by the fact that so liberal were the new bond issues\r\nthat the total fixed charges after reorganization were to be greater\r\nthan those before. The floating debt which remained had arisen from\r\nlack of funds with which to make current and necessary improvements\r\nand repairs. This debt was the immediate cause of the failure of the\r\ncompany, and its cancellation was the real purpose of the plan. The\r\nmethod proposed was a forced levy upon bondholders, but the levy\r\ntook, not the form of an assessment, but that of a subscription to\r\nnew bonds on which payment of interest was to be as obligatory as any\r\nother charge. The operation differed, therefore, from an ordinary sale\r\nof securities in the more favorable selling price which it assured.\r\nIt did little, however, to lighten the burden which had crushed the\r\ncompany. The only bright spot in the plan was the provision for future\r\nconstruction and improvement, which, though involving a still further\r\nincrease in indebtedness, was justified because these improvements\r\nwould serve not only to maintain but to make greater the earning\r\npowers of the company. Finally, it was the peculiar effect of this\r\nplan that it put the pressure imposed upon the wrong parties: the\r\nsecond consolidated and other junior bondholders were to be forced to\r\nsubscribe to the new issue, when in fact it was the stockholders who\r\nshould have been turned to, and whom it was consonant with no sound\r\nprinciple of finance to spare. Other matters come out in the objections\r\nraised by bondholders.\r\n\r\nOpposition to the plan was vigorously headed by men like Kuhn, Loeb &\r\nCo., E. H. Harriman, August Belmont, Hallgarten, Peabody, Vermilye,\r\nand others.[139] In England a meeting of dissentients was held and a\r\ncommittee was elected;[140] in America the first formal action was the\r\ndispatch of a letter to the Erie managers by opposing bankers which is\r\nimportant enough to be quoted in full.\r\n\r\n“Consultations and comparisons of views have recently taken place,”\r\nsaid these gentlemen, “between the owners and representatives of the\r\nsecond consolidated mortgage bonds and other bonds of your company,\r\nto whom the proposition as detailed in your circular of January 2 is\r\nnot satisfactory.... Your plan seems unjust, inasmuch as it demands a\r\npermanent reduction of interest on the bonded indebtedness for which\r\nno adequate equivalent is offered, and it levies a forced contribution\r\nupon the bondholders through the demand for a subscription to new bonds\r\nat a price considerably over and above the market value these new bonds\r\nare likely to command, while the fixed charges proposed to be created\r\nappear to be considerably larger than, in the light of past earnings\r\nand experience, the property of the company can carry with safety.\r\n\r\n“Instead of 5 per cent bonds, as provided in the published plan, 4 per\r\ncent bonds, in our opinion, should be issued, while for the interest\r\nto be surrendered the bondholders should receive an equivalent in\r\ninterminable non-cumulative 4 per cent debentures, interest payable if\r\nearned; the holders of the debentures to have sufficient representation\r\nin the management to protect them.\r\n\r\n“The floating debt should be liquidated from the proceeds of an\r\nadequate amount of new 4 per cent bonds (and debentures if desirable),\r\nwhich shall be offered to the shareholders and bondholders at a\r\nprice rather below than above the probable market value of the new\r\nsecurities, and under the guarantee of an underwriting syndicate.\r\n\r\n“Provision should also be made to obtain the conversion on fair terms\r\nof the reorganization prior lien bonds into the new bonds, so that it\r\nshall become practicable to secure the new 4 per cent bonds at once by\r\na lien second only to the ‘Erie first consolidated 7 per cent bonds’;\r\nthe new 4 per cent bonds to be issued under a general mortgage to an\r\namount sufficient to provide for future additions and improvements, and\r\nwith adequate provision for the taking up of the underlying bonds, and\r\nthe issue of 4 per cent bonds in their stead.... Any plan now adopted\r\nfor the readjustment of the finances of your company should seek,\r\nas its first object, to reduce the permanent charges so well within\r\nthe earning capacity of the property as to make another default in\r\nthe future an improbability.... We trust this communication will be\r\nreceived in the spirit in which it is submitted.”[141]\r\n\r\nThe directors refused to modify their plan, and the bankers, therefore,\r\nnotified them of the election of a protective committee.[142] On March\r\n6 a meeting of stockholders approved the plan, and the same week\r\nMessrs. Drexel, Morgan & Co. gave notice that, having received deposits\r\nof a majority of each class of bonds, they had declared the plan\r\noperative as announced.[143]\r\n\r\nDefeated in their appeal to the securityholders, the opposition\r\nturned to the courts. As a preliminary, they obtained an opinion from\r\nthe well-known firm of Messrs. Evarts, Choate & Beaman, which held,\r\nfirst, that the Erie could not legally pay interest on the new bonds\r\nproposed until it had paid the interest on every one of the old second\r\nmortgage bonds, regardless of whether the latter was deposited with\r\nthe reorganization committee; second, that if the old second mortgage\r\nbonds which were deposited as security for the new issue should be kept\r\nalive as proposed, the company would be increasing its obligations\r\nbeyond the legal limit;[144] and third, that much of the stock voted\r\nat the special meeting at which the new mortgage had been authorized\r\nwas not really owned by the persons who had issued the proxies thereon\r\nas the law provided.[145] Following the opinion, suit was commenced by\r\nMr. Harriman in April for an injunction against the recording of the\r\nnew mortgage, on the ground that the Drexel & Morgan proxies did not\r\nrepresent the actual stockholders, and in June by one John J. Emery to\r\nprevent the execution of the mortgage. Judge Ingraham in the Supreme\r\nCourt Chambers denied an injunction, using in his opinion the following\r\nlanguage: “While it is clear,” said he, “that there are certain\r\nobligations resting upon the majority to refrain from infringing the\r\nlegal right of the minority, and that a court of equity will enforce\r\nand protect the rights of the minority, still, when the holder of a\r\nvery small number of bonds or shares of stock seeks to enjoin a very\r\nlarge majority from carrying out a plan such majority deem to be for\r\ntheir benefit, I think the court should not interfere unless it plainly\r\nappears that some legal right of the minority is endangered.”[146]\r\n\r\nWhat could not be accomplished by the hostile bankers was nevertheless\r\nto happen from the inherent weakness of the plan itself. It has been\r\nsaid that the new scheme involved an increase instead of a decrease\r\nin fixed charges. How this was to be met was not demonstrated; and\r\nalready in June, 1894, it was necessary to announce that the coupons\r\nthen due would not be paid for the present. In December matters were\r\neven worse, and a circular from Drexel, Morgan & Co. confessed the\r\ncompany’s inability to meet the coupons maturing. “Nevertheless,” the\r\nfirm continued, “it seems to us inexpedient to treat the inability of\r\nthe company to pay interest as an occasion for present foreclosure\r\nwithout giving a further chance to the company, especially as payment\r\nof bondholders’ subscriptions to the new bonds has not yet been called\r\nto provide the company with money necessary to pay the floating\r\ndebt. It is, therefore, now proposed that the new bonds be issued\r\nwith the coupons of June 1, 1894, and December, 1894, attached, but\r\nstamped as subject to a contract with the company which shall provide\r\nthat they shall be paid as soon as practical out of the first net\r\nearnings over and above the railroad company’s requirements to meet\r\ninterest and rentals accruing after December 1, 1894, except in case\r\na default on later coupons shall give power of foreclosure, in which\r\nevent the stamped coupons shall retain all their original rights.”\r\nThe modification was assented to,[147] but could not save the plan.\r\nReluctantly the managers were forced to abandon it, and to consent to\r\nmore radical propositions.\r\n\r\nAugust 26, 1895, the new and final reorganization plan appeared. There\r\nwere to be issued:\r\n\r\n  $175,000,000 first consolidated mortgage 100-year gold bonds;\r\n    30,000,000 first preferred 4 per cent non-cumulative stock;\r\n    16,000,000 second preferred 4 per cent non-cumulative stock;\r\n   100,000,000 common stock.\r\n\r\nThe first consolidated mortgage bonds were to be divided into prior\r\nlien bonds to the amount of $35,000,000, and general lien bonds to the\r\namount of $140,000,000; the former to have priority of lien over the\r\nlatter for both principal and interest. Both classes of bonds were to\r\nbe secured by mortgage and pledge of all railroads and properties of\r\nevery kind embraced in the reorganization as carried out and vested in\r\nthe new company, and also all other properties which should be acquired\r\nthereafter by issue of any of the new bonds. Both issues were to bear\r\ninterest at 4 per cent, except $29,435,000 of the general lien bonds,\r\nwhich were to bear 3 per cent for two years from July 1, 1896, and 4\r\nper cent thereafter. The stock was to rank for dividends in the order\r\ngiven. Provision was made that no additional mortgage could be put upon\r\nthe property to be acquired, and that no additional issue of first\r\npreferred stock could be made except with the consent in each instance\r\nof the holders of a majority of the whole amount of each class of\r\npreferred stock, given at a meeting of the stockholders called for that\r\npurpose; and with the consent of the stockholders of a majority of such\r\npart of the common stock as should be represented at such meeting, the\r\nholders of each class of stock voting separately; also that the amount\r\nof second preferred stock could not be increased except with like\r\nconsent of the holders of a majority thereof, and a majority of such\r\npart of the common stock as should be represented at the meeting. All\r\nclasses of stock were to be deposited in a voting trust until December\r\n1, 1900, and until the expiration of such further period, if any, as\r\nshould elapse before the Erie should in one year have paid 4 per cent\r\ncash dividends on the first preferred stock; though the voting trustees\r\nmight terminate the trust earlier at their discretion.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the prior lien bonds were relied on to pay the\r\nfloating debt, to buy in the New York, Pennsylvania & Ohio, and to\r\nretire certain prior liens of the old company. The general lien bonds\r\nwere reserved for undisturbed bonds, and, with the first preferred\r\nstock, exchanged for junior New York, Lake Erie & Western securities.\r\nThe second preferred stock went for old preferred stock and income\r\nbonds, and the new common stock exchanged for old common.\r\n\r\nThe distribution was as follows: The old New York, Lake Erie & Western\r\nreorganization first lien and collateral bonds were paid off from the\r\nproceeds of the new prior lien bonds; the second consols received\r\n75 per cent in new general lien bonds and 55 per cent in preferred\r\nstock; the funded coupon bonds of 1885 received 100 per cent in general\r\nlien bonds, 10 per cent in first preferred, and 10 per cent in second\r\npreferred stock; the income bonds 40 per cent in general liens and 60\r\nper cent in first preferred stock; the New York, Lake Erie & Western\r\npreferred stock, on payment of assessment, 100 per cent in new common.\r\nFor all other bonds included in the plan there were reserved general\r\nlien bonds in amounts usually equal to the par of the securities to be\r\nretired.\r\n\r\nThe cash requirements and the floating debt were as follows:\r\n\r\n  Floating debt, receivers’ certificates, etc.,      $11,500,000\r\n  Collateral trust bonds (Erie), at 110,               3,678,400\r\n  Reorganization first lien bonds (Erie),              2,500,000\r\n  Early construction and expenditures,                 5,337,288\r\n  Car trusts for three years,                          2,000,000\r\n                                                     -----------\r\n                                                     $25,015,688\r\n\r\nThe necessity for retirement of the first lien and collateral bonds\r\narose from the early maturity of the former, and from the fact that\r\nstocks and bonds of various Erie properties which it was desirous to\r\nconsolidate with the new company were pledged for the latter. The\r\nwisdom of allowing for early construction and expenditure could not be\r\ndenied; car trust payments were required to preserve the rolling stock,\r\nand the floating debt and receivers’ certificates called obviously for\r\ncash. Provision was made, first, by an assessment on the stock of $8\r\non preferred and $12 on common, with higher payments in case of delay,\r\nand estimated to yield $10,023,368; second, by a contribution from\r\nthe New York, Pennsylvania & Ohio of $742,320; and third, by the sale\r\nof $15,000,000 prior lien bonds as indicated above. A syndicate of\r\n$25,000,000 was formed to subscribe to the prior liens, and to take the\r\nplace of and succeed to all the rights of stockholders who should not\r\ndeposit their stock and pay the assessment thereon.\r\n\r\nWith the settlement of cash requirements, unification of the Erie\r\nsystem was assured; “subject only to the undisturbed bonds and stock\r\nuntil retired by use of the bonds reserved for that purpose or the\r\nrentals corresponding thereto.” “The new bonds and stock will,” said\r\nthe plan, “represent the ownership (either in fee or in possession of\r\nsecurities) approximately of:\r\n\r\n  N. Y., L. E. & W. proper,                   538 miles\r\n  N. Y., P. & O.,                             600\r\n  Chicago & Erie,                             250\r\n  N. Y., L. E. & W. Auxiliary Companies,      550\r\n                                             ----\r\n              Total,                         1938 miles[148]\r\n\r\n—with valuable terminal facilities at Jersey City, Weehawken, Buffalo,\r\netc., and also one-fifth ownership in the stock of the Chicago &\r\nWestern Indiana Railroad Company. Also all the Erie coal properties,\r\n... representing an aggregate of 10,000 acres of anthracite, of which\r\nabout 9000 acres are held in fee, and 14,000 acres of bituminous, held\r\nunder mining rights ... also the Union Steamboat Company, with its\r\nterminals and other properties in Buffalo, and its fleet of five lake\r\nsteamers on which the Erie mainly depends for the lake and railway\r\ntraffic,” etc.\r\n\r\nFixed charges under the plan were estimated at $7,850,000. Fixed\r\ncharges in 1894 had been $9,400,000. For the first two years after\r\nreorganization, moreover, the charges were to be further reduced by\r\n$300,000 per annum, as the new general lien bonds were to bear only\r\n3 per cent interest during that period; and an additional saving of\r\n$1,000,000 was looked for when the exchange of old bonds for new on\r\nthe maturity of its existing prior issues should have been eventually\r\ncompleted. This sum of $7,850,000 the company was expected to have\r\nno difficulty in earning in view of the immediate expenditure of\r\n$5,337,208 for new construction, additions, and betterments, and the\r\ngradual distribution of the proceeds of $17,000,000 of general lien\r\nbonds to the same end. The compensation to Messrs. J. P. Morgan & Co.\r\nand Messrs. J. S. Morgan & Co. for their services as depositaries, and\r\nin carrying out the plan was put at $500,000 and expenses. Foreclosure\r\nwas finally to take place and a new company was to be organized.\r\n\r\nThis plan differed from its abandoned predecessors in four important\r\nparticulars, each of which was in its favor:\r\n\r\n(1) It employed bonds and stock instead of bonds alone;\r\n\r\n(2) It lowered instead of increased fixed charges;\r\n\r\n(3) It procured cash from stockholders instead of from second\r\nconsolidated mortgage bondholders; and\r\n\r\n(4) It absorbed the New York, Pennsylvania & Ohio into the Erie system\r\ninstead of continuing the lease thereof.\r\n\r\nIn the employment of bonds and stock instead of a simple issue of\r\nbonds, the Erie managers adopted what experience has shown to be the\r\nbest method of dealing with the complicated situation arising from\r\na great railroad default. The use of securities on which return was\r\noptional side by side with those on which return was obligatory tended\r\nboth to protect the railroad company when earnings were low, and to\r\nbenefit the recipients of the new securities when earnings were high.\r\nAs worked out, it gave to the second consols and funded coupons a less\r\nreturn in the one case, and an equal or greater return in the other,\r\nthan did the plan of 1894, and to the income bonds, though it offered\r\nno chance of equal gain, it at least promised a minimum below which\r\npayments should not fall. It further made a far nicer recognition of\r\nthe relative priorities of different classes of old bonds possible, and\r\nwhereas the previous plan had made the same demands on, and had given\r\nthe same return to the second consols, the funded coupon bonds of 1885,\r\nand the income bonds, the new plan gave, as has been pointed out, to\r\nthe first 75 percent in general lien bonds and 55 per cent in first\r\npreferred stock; to the second, 100 per cent in general lien bonds, 10\r\nper cent in first preferred, and 10 per cent in second preferred; and\r\nto the third, 40 per cent in general liens and 60 per cent in first\r\npreferred stock. Income, coupon, and consolidated bonds benefited\r\nalike from the assessment upon the stock, which laid the burden of\r\nraising cash upon the owners of the road, where it most properly fell.\r\nNo species of security was given for the assessment, not even common\r\nstock, with which the managers might well have been generous; although\r\nit must be remembered that the sale of $15,000,000 prior lien bonds\r\nfor cash was part of the reorganization plan. It may be remarked that\r\nsince, on July 2, 1895, the common stock was being offered at 10⅝, with\r\nno sales, and the preferred at 22½, and since the chance for dividends\r\nwhich the new stock was to enjoy was most remote, it was perhaps well\r\nthat the syndicate guarantee of the payment of assessments had been\r\nobtained. Fixed charges by the new plan were lower, as a result of the\r\nliberal use of stock in the exchanges and the cancellation of floating\r\ndebt as above; while the terms under which the outstanding New York,\r\nPennsylvania & Ohio bonds were retired were the most drastic part of\r\nthe scheme. In all, the total mortgage indebtedness of the Erie Company\r\nand its leased or controlled lines of $234,680,180 for January, 1896,\r\nwas reduced to $137,704,100 by June 30 of that year.[149]\r\n\r\nA weak point in the plan was, nevertheless, the small reduction in\r\nbonded indebtedness which it occasioned. Although, to repeat, the\r\nbonded indebtedness of the system was reduced from $234,680,180 to\r\n$137,704,100, the shrinkage was more apparent than real, since it\r\nconsisted chiefly in the exchange of stock for New York, Pennsylvania\r\n& Ohio mortgage bonds, on which interest had not been paid by the\r\nErie, and but seldom by the New York, Pennsylvania, & Ohio itself.\r\nThese securities were slashed in most drastic fashion, particularly\r\nsuch of them as were inferior to the first mortgage. The amount of\r\nthe reduction in the volume outstanding is indicated by the fact that\r\nfor $5000 first mortgage New York, Pennsylvania & Ohio bonds were\r\ngiven $1000 Erie prior lien bonds, $500 Erie first preferred, $100\r\nErie second preferred, and $750 Erie common stock; and for $500 second\r\nmortgage, or for $1000 third mortgage, were given $100 Erie common\r\nstock. If, now, we exclude the New York, Pennsylvania & Ohio bonds\r\nfrom our consideration of the funded debt, we find the indebtedness\r\nof the Erie system on January 1, 1896, excluding the non-assumed New\r\nYork, Pennsylvania & Ohio bonds to have been $121,399,431; and on June\r\n30, excluding the new prior lien bonds used to exchange for these\r\nsecurities, to have been $123,304,100; or an increase through the\r\nreorganization of $1,904,669.[150] Further, there was an accompanying\r\nincrease in the capital stock of the combined companies, which did\r\nnot, of course, involve an increase in fixed charges, but which\r\nincreased the volume of securities outstanding.[151] What the reduction\r\nin the capital of the New York, Pennsylvania & Ohio, joined with its\r\namalgamation with the Erie system, did do was to lessen the burdens of\r\nthat line to the parent company. For many years the Erie had engaged\r\nto operate the branch for 68 per cent and had paid 32 per cent of its\r\ngross earnings to the New York, Pennsylvania & Ohio, to be applied to\r\npayment or partial payment of interest on the excessive issues which\r\nwere now retired. It was probably to be long before an operating\r\nratio of 68 per cent could be successfully maintained; but the Erie\r\nafter reorganization was obliged to turn over, not 32 per cent of\r\ngross earnings, but 4 per cent on the $14,400,000 prior lien bonds\r\nwhich had been given for New York, Pennsylvania & Ohio securities, or\r\nan amount of $576,000; which amounted to a reduction of the minimum\r\nrental of more than one-half, and of the sums actually paid of almost\r\nthree-quarters.[152]\r\n\r\nTurning again to fixed charges, we find them estimated, after the first\r\ntwo years, at $7,850,000. The average net earnings for the period\r\n1887–94 had been $9,331,250. These earnings will not serve strictly as\r\na basis for calculation, for from 1887 to 1892 they include an average\r\nof perhaps $750,000 derived from Lehigh Valley trackage payments\r\nand other sums now discontinued. With the deduction, therefore, of\r\nthis amount from the net earnings of the period named, the average\r\nis reduced to $8,768,750; or $918,750 more than it was thought fixed\r\ncharges would be. When it is considered that this $918,750 represented\r\nthe sum available for dividends on $146,000,000 of outstanding Erie\r\nstock, it is plain that the over-capitalization of the company in 1895\r\nwas still very great.\r\n\r\nWith these comments it is necessary to leave the plan. It was far\r\nthe best that had ever been applied to the rehabilitation of Erie’s\r\naffairs; it was discriminating in its nature, and, thanks to the\r\nincreasing prosperity of the last eleven years, it has been fortunate\r\nin its results. In August, 1895, a decree of foreclosure was signed\r\nin the city of New York, and the following November the property was\r\nsold under the second consolidated mortgage, and purchased by the\r\nreorganization committee for $20,000,000.[153]\r\n\r\nSince 1895 the Erie has shared in the prosperity of the country. Its\r\nton mileage has increased from 3,939,679,175 in 1897 to 6,275,629,877\r\nin 1907; its gross earnings have grown from $31,497,031 to $53,914,827;\r\nand its net earnings, which had hovered for so many years near or\r\nbelow the level of fixed charges, have now soared away above. Under\r\nthese circumstances it is but natural that large sums should have been\r\napplied to improvements. Between December 1, 1895, and June 30, 1907,\r\n$12,732,486 were spent in the purchase of land, in yards, stations,\r\nand buildings, in reducing grades, relocating tracks, and in other\r\nways, and charged to capital; $36,511,046 were spent for new equipment,\r\nand charged to capital; and $8,625,307 were taken from income for\r\nequipment and improvements of various sorts. These expenditures have\r\nhad a most gratifying result. The average train load has grown from\r\n224.74 tons in 1895 to 471.67 in 1907, although coal now constitutes a\r\nsmaller proportion of the freight; and the average revenue per train\r\nmile has more than doubled, in face of a revenue per ton mile which\r\nhas only slightly increased. In 1907 the Erie’s ton mileage was 59 per\r\ncent greater than in 1897, and its passenger mileage was 73 per cent\r\ngreater, but the expense of conducting transportation had increased\r\nbut 27 per cent. Instead of freight cars with an average capacity of\r\n22½ tons the company now uses cars which average 34 tons. Instead of\r\nlocomotives which on the average could exert a tractive force of only\r\n24,500 pounds as late as 1901, it has now engines which average 31,000.\r\nFreight train mileage is 2,600,000 less than it was in 1896, and\r\npassenger train mileage has only slightly increased.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, with all this prosperity, it cannot be said that the Erie\r\nenjoys an assured position. In 1907 it had to pay out 89 per cent of\r\nthe largest income which it had ever received for operating expenses,\r\nfixed charges, and taxes. Of its net income of about $6,000,000 the\r\nmodest dividends of 4 per cent on its first and second preferred stock\r\nabsorb some $2,500,000, and the widespread financial difficulties of\r\n1907 have led its management to declare the dividends for that year\r\npayable in scrip and not in cash. And although the present period of\r\nreaction dates back but a little way the company has been already\r\nobliged to the issue of short term notes.\r\n\r\nIn matters of railroad policy the Erie has accordingly been\r\nconservative. In 1898 it acquired control of the New York, Susquehanna\r\n& Western, from New York City to Wilkesbarre in northeast Pennsylvania.\r\nThree years later it bought the entire stock of the Pennsylvania\r\nCoal Company in order to protect its tonnage, and, as the directors\r\nexpressed it, for other reasons which seemed good; and in 1901 also it\r\nbought an interest in the Lehigh Valley. The most sensational episode\r\nwhich has occurred has been the purchase and subsequent release of\r\nthe Cincinnati, Hamilton & Dayton. It seems that in 1905 Mr. J. P.\r\nMorgan bought a majority of a syndicate’s holdings in Cincinnati,\r\nHamilton & Dayton stock, amounting to a majority of the total issue;\r\na purchase which carried control of the Pere Marquette and of the\r\nChicago, Cincinnati & Louisville, or of a total system of 3675 miles.\r\nThis stock Mr. Morgan turned over to the Erie at a price reported to be\r\n$160 a share. From a traffic point of view the deal seemed likely to\r\nstrengthen the Erie’s position in Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan, while\r\nmore than doubling the mileage of its system. Because of the financial\r\ncondition of the new companies, however, the purchase was decidedly\r\nunwise; and, after an investigation, Mr. Morgan’s offer to take the\r\nroad off the Erie’s hands was gladly accepted. On December 4, 1905,\r\nMr. Judson Harmon was appointed receiver of the Cincinnati, Hamilton\r\n& Dayton and of the Pere Marquette, and the reorganization of these\r\nproperties is just being completed.\r\n\r\nAt present the Erie is operating 2169 miles of road as against 2166\r\nin 1896. Its earnings have greatly increased, its capitalization has\r\ngrown in less proportion,[154] but it has not yet a sufficient margin\r\nof surplus earnings to meet a decline in prosperity without serious\r\nmisgivings. Dividends on its first preferred stock have been paid since\r\n1901, and on its second preferred since 1905. The common stock cannot\r\nexpect a dividend in any period which can be foreseen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA & READING\r\n\r\n  Early history—Purchase of coal lands—Funding of floating debt—\r\n    Failure—Struggles between Gowen and his opponents—Reorganization\r\n    —Second failure and reorganization.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Philadelphia & Reading Railroad has been peculiarly unfortunate.\r\nAlthough serving a region of abundant traffic, it failed three times\r\nbetween 1880 and 1895, and was in the hands of receivers ten years.\r\nIt was reorganized after each failure, and each reorganization was\r\nmarked by bitter struggles between contending parties, due in part to\r\ndivergence in financial interests, and in part to personal rivalries.\r\n\r\nIn 1833 the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad was chartered by the\r\nLegislature of Pennsylvania to build a road from Philadelphia to\r\nReading, a distance of 58 miles. Its early history does not concern\r\nus. In 1862 it leased, owned, and operated 437.4 miles of track,\r\nequivalent, roughly, to 119.4 miles of line; and derived $2,879,419\r\nout of its gross earnings of $3,911,830 from the carriage of coal.\r\nIts capitalization was extremely high, roughly, $193,417 per mile\r\nof line,[155] and the necessary payments each year, not including\r\ndividends, took up $1,454,635. At this time the road owned no coal\r\nlands, but, like the Lehigh Valley Railroad and the Schuylkill Canal,\r\nremained a common carrier, and relied upon the advantages of its\r\nposition in respect to the Southern coal fields to secure the tonnage\r\nwhich it required.\r\n\r\nFrom 1862 to 1865 inclusive the Reading enjoyed a period of extreme\r\nprosperity. The Navy Department, during the war, required large\r\nquantities of fuel, and in the revival of business after the conclusion\r\nof peace the Reading took its part. Merchandise earnings increased from\r\n$523,416 in 1862 to $1,165,277 in 1865; coal earnings from $2,879,419\r\nto $8,627,292; and though expenses also increased, yet net earnings\r\ngrew from $2,375,247 to $5,236,655, and the balance of earnings, after\r\nall charges had been paid, from $920,612 to $2,632,566. Dividends\r\nmeanwhile ranged from 14 per cent on the preferred stock in 1862 to 10\r\nper cent on both preferred and common in 1866, though the majority of\r\nthe distributions were made in stock. On the whole, during the Civil\r\nWar and for a whole year afterwards, the Reading was able to carry\r\nwithout difficulty the burden of an enormous capitalization. What\r\nincrease in capital occurred at this time was in stock, and did not\r\nadd to the load, although the desire to pay dividends on the increased\r\nstock led to the piling up of new issues.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 an entirely new departure in Reading policy occurred. Whereas\r\nthe road had previously owned no coal lands, with the advent of Mr.\r\nF. B. Gowen to the presidency it began to purchase on an enormous\r\nscale. “The repeated and serious interruptions of the business of the\r\ncompany,” said the annual report for 1871, “caused by strikers in the\r\ncoal regions during the last few years, and the many fluctuations\r\nin the coal trade, produced by alternate periods of expansion and\r\ndepression resulting therefrom, have attracted the attention of the\r\nmanagers of the company to the necessity of exercising some control\r\nover the production of coal, so as to prevent a recurrence of the\r\ndifficulties heretofore experienced; and it was believed that the best\r\nway to accomplish this result, without injuriously affecting individual\r\ninterests, was for the company to become the owner of coal lands\r\nsituate upon the line of its several branches.”[156] Further, it was\r\nfelt that some steps were necessary to retain for the Reading even the\r\ncoal tonnage which it enjoyed. In 1871 every rival carrier had invested\r\nlarge sums in coal properties, and all the fields but the Schuylkill\r\nand Mahanoy (western middle) were occupied, while carriers had begun to\r\nenter the Mahanoy district, and it was reported to be their intention\r\nto build lines straight through to the Schuylkill fields.\r\n\r\nThe anthracite coal regions of Pennsylvania lie in four main districts:\r\nthe Northern or Wyoming; the Southern or Schuylkill; and two smaller\r\nintermediate fields known respectively as the Eastern Middle or Lehigh\r\nregion and the Western Middle or Mahanoy and Shamokin basins. The\r\nNorthern field is the more easily worked, and the Southern field is\r\nthe richer.[157] Between 1869 and 1881 the Reading Railroad and its\r\nalter ego, the Coal & Iron Company, formed for the purpose, spent\r\n$73,326,668 for lands in the Schuylkill and Western Middle districts,\r\nsecuring 142 square miles, or 60 per cent of all the anthracite\r\nlands of these districts, and 30 per cent of all in Pennsylvania. Of\r\nthe purchase money $69,816,204 were supplied either by the Railroad\r\nCompany or by sale of Coal & Iron Company bonds which the Railroad\r\nCompany guaranteed. The Coal & Iron Company incurred non-guaranteed\r\nliabilities for the rest.[158] This gave ample resources for the\r\npermanent supply of coal tonnage to the railroad, and was sufficient\r\nalso to give a considerable measure of control over production in the\r\nSouthern district. Independent operators did continue, however, and\r\nthe Reading coal was subject to the competition of coal from other\r\nfields. More important still, in attaining control, “all kinds of coal\r\nproperties, good, bad, and indifferent, were purchased without regard\r\nto original cost, location, or revenue producing capacity.”[159] In\r\n1880 an engineer of reputation was appointed to evaluate the Reading\r\ncoal lands, and recommended the surrender of five properties that\r\noriginally cost $5,207,167, upon which there were encumbrances of\r\n$5,015,000. “But little weight,” said he, “should be given to the\r\nfear that rivals will possess the surrendered property; most of it\r\nis not a tempting investment.” Exorbitant prices were paid for the\r\nlands purchased. By 1881, as noted, there had been expended in all by\r\nthe two Reading companies $73,326,668. This same report said that,\r\n“assuming the profit on the future coal product to be 30 cents per ton\r\nof coal shipped, that the company will be able to reduce the rate of\r\ninterest on the money needed to hold and develop the property from 7\r\nper cent to 6 per cent per annum, and that the development will be at\r\nthe rate just stated [outlined earlier in the report], the whole estate\r\nhas a value of $32,394,799: the company’s interest in the estate is\r\nworth $30,630,648, and, including colliery improvements belonging to\r\nthe company, but situate on lands owned by others, the whole of the\r\ncompany’s property is worth $31,197,484.”[160]\r\n\r\nIt is unquestionable that the Reading did acquire an enormously\r\nvaluable property in the decade succeeding 1870. It seems just as clear\r\nthat it paid more for this than was necessary; but what is perhaps\r\nmore to the point is the fact that the Reading paid more than it could\r\nafford. Whatever the ultimate advantages to be gained by exclusive\r\npossession of any considerable section of the coal fields, the Reading\r\nwas not large enough nor financially strong enough to make such vast\r\npurchases within so short a space of time. The prosperity of the Civil\r\nWar had disappeared, net profits were fluctuating without marked\r\ntendency to increase, the figures for 1870 being actually less than\r\nthose of 1863, while the interest on bonds had more than doubled since\r\n1867, and the sum required for dividends had increased. To advance\r\n$54,886,647 to the Coal & Iron Company under these conditions, and to\r\nbecome responsible as guarantor for $14,929,557 more, would have been\r\nill-advised even had the prices paid by the company been in strict\r\naccord with the commercial estimate of the time. Under the best of\r\ncircumstances returns from much of the property acquired could not\r\nbe secured for many years. The parts of the coal fields which were\r\nworked yielded an income, though it was seldom that the collieries were\r\nallowed to run to their full capacity; but those districts which were\r\nbought for the sake of controlling the coal situation, or in order to\r\nsecure a future reserve, and which in many cases could not be worked at\r\nexisting prices, occasioned a drain upon the company to the amount of\r\ninterest on the purchase money, with no return of any kind. Moreover,\r\nthe purchase of the coal lands put the Reading in the anomalous\r\nposition of a railroad corporation interested in industrial lines. It\r\ncould no longer be content with encouraging the transportation of its\r\nmain source of revenue (coal), but had to care as well for the price at\r\nwhich this coal was sold. When depression in the coal trade came, the\r\nReading lost both as producer and as carrier, for less was transported,\r\nand that amount was sold at a lower price; but when good times came,\r\nfrom which as a simple carrier it might have profited largely, it\r\nstruggled with conditions of over-production which should rightly have\r\nbeen none of its concern. There was, finally, a peculiar fatality in\r\nthe time which the Reading chose for its expansion. The year 1873 will\r\nalways be remembered as one of the most disastrous in the history of\r\nthe United States. Commencing with the failure of Messrs. Jay Cooke &\r\nCo. on the 18th of September, the panic spread with such rapidity as to\r\nlead to the closing of the New York Stock Exchange on September 30. All\r\nrailroad securities were exceedingly depressed, call loans were high,\r\nand it was nearly impossible to secure new capital. Business the next\r\nfive years was very dull, and the Reading actually earned less gross in\r\n1879 than in the year before the panic, and this at the very time that\r\nits liabilities were so largely extended. The natural result was the\r\nfinancial difficulty which can be detected as early as 1876. In June it\r\nappears that, owing “to the continued depression in the iron and coal\r\ntrades and the consequent falling off in transportation,” the road was\r\nobliged to reduce its working force. In July the usual dividend was\r\npassed; salaries were lowered in September, and still later a temporary\r\nloan was secured to tide over the floating debt, which then amounted\r\nto $8,272,359. By the next year the matter had become serious enough\r\nto necessitate a formal proposition to creditors for the postponement\r\nof interest payments and of payments on the floating debt. The company\r\nprofessed itself able to carry out the following:\r\n\r\n(_a_) To pay the interest on prior liens in full.\r\n\r\n(_b_) To pay one-half the interest on the general mortgage bonds and\r\non the Perkiomen sterling mortgage bonds for three years in cash, and\r\none-half in five-year interest-bearing scrip, with the option to the\r\nholder of receiving instead scrip for the three coupons first maturing\r\nand cash for the rest.\r\n\r\n(_c_) To pay for five years in scrip the interest on the debenture\r\nbonds of both the Railroad and Coal & Iron Companies; the convertible\r\nbonds of the Railroad Company, the bonds due in 1885, 1902, and 1918 of\r\nthe Tidewater & Susquehanna Canal Company, and so much of the rent due\r\nto the Schuylkill Navigation Company as was applicable to the payment\r\nof dividends to stockholders of the Company and to the interest upon\r\nits mortgage loan of 1895.\r\n\r\n(_d_) To suspend the drawings for the payments of sinking funds and of\r\nthe improvement and general mortgage bonds for a period not exceeding\r\nfour years, if so long a time should be required for the payment of the\r\nfloating debt.[161]\r\n\r\n“The relief to be obtained from the above,” said President Gowen, “will\r\nundoubtedly enable the managers, even with no improvement in traffic\r\nor increase of rates, to meet the fixed charges on all obligations\r\nof both companies other than those above named, and to pay off the\r\nentire floating debt within such time as will be satisfactory to the\r\nholders thereof.” Certain modifications were suggested by the London\r\nsecurityholders, providing for trustees with some power to protect the\r\ncreditors,[162] and the plan went quietly into effect.\r\n\r\nFrom now on matters went from bad to worse. The year 1878 showed a\r\nfalling off in almost every source of revenue, while expenses and\r\ncharges remained very nearly the same. Depression in the coal trade and\r\nconnection with the Coal & Iron Company, general dulness of business\r\nafter 1873, troubles with employees, over-capitalization, all had their\r\nshare in pushing the company still further into the mire. It became\r\nunable to keep its share of the existing business, and the percentages\r\nof the Schuylkill output carried by it steadily decreased from 83.49\r\nin 1877 to 75.45 in 1881, while its percentage of the aggregate output\r\nfrom all the anthracite region diminished from 32.82 to 24.44. “It\r\nappears, therefore,” said the annual report for 1881, “that while\r\nother companies have steadily increased their capacity of production\r\nby regular and judicious expenditures for new openings, breakers,\r\nmachinery, and other facilities for mining and delivering coal, the\r\nReading Company has apparently remained stationary.... For this policy\r\nthe local officers in charge are not probably responsible, as it\r\nwas undoubtedly forced upon them by the management, because of the\r\nimpoverished and embarrassed condition of the company’s finances.”[163]\r\n\r\nThroughout 1879 there was trouble over the payment of wages, perhaps\r\nas good a sign of financial difficulty as can be desired. Employees\r\nwere paid in scrip, not cash, and even scrip wages were left overdue.\r\nPresident Gowen went to Europe toward the middle of the year, but not\r\nat all, as he carefully explained, in order to place a new loan, or to\r\ntransact any business except a little in relation to some railroads for\r\nthe company; in fact, the condition of the Reading was an open secret,\r\nand new loans were impossible to obtain. In May, 1880, the New York and\r\nPhiladelphia banks began to refuse further accommodations. At the same\r\ntime the period during which, according to the agreement of 1877, cash\r\npayment of general mortgage coupons was suspended, drew to a close, and\r\non May 21 the Philadelphia & Reading announced its inability to meet\r\nits obligations. As was said at the time, the company did not fall with\r\na crash because it had not far to fall.\r\n\r\nThe failure occurred on May 21, and on May 24 Messrs. F. B. Gowen\r\n(president of the company), Edwin A. Lewis, and Stephen A. Caldwell\r\nwere appointed receivers. Their resources were scanty and they had\r\nto do with them as best they could. On the one hand they applied to\r\nthe court for authority to borrow $1,000,000 to pay the wages of\r\nemployees and interest falling due July 1, and on the other they cut\r\ndown expenses by reducing the working force in the repair shops, by\r\nputting the shops on short time, by discontinuing many of the trains on\r\ndifferent lines, and by ceasing all dead work at the collieries.\r\n\r\nBefore any plan could be proposed for the rehabilitation of the\r\ncompany the condition of its finances had to be known, and this again\r\nthe receivers took in charge. Their report in June, 1880, showed\r\na sufficiently serious state of affairs. The floating debt of the\r\nRailroad Company had mounted up to $10,254,766, besides $1,900,482\r\nmore for the Coal & Iron Company. This represented an increase\r\nof $3,604,000 as compared with November 30, 1879, and an English\r\nbondholders’ committee declared that only $2,930,000 of it were\r\nrepresented by value.[164] The rest had apparently been incurred in\r\ndesperate attempts to preserve the solvency of the company. The total\r\nliabilities of the Railroad and Coal & Iron Companies, including\r\nmortgage, debenture debt, floating debt, and miscellaneous items, but\r\nexcluding stock, were $152,436,890. The deduction from these figures of\r\nthe Coal & Iron bonds held by the Railroad Company, which would have\r\nconstituted a duplication of indebtedness, left a total of $106,215,830.\r\n\r\nThe stock of the two companies amounted to $42,278,175, and the\r\nstock in the hands of the public to $39,278,175. The grand total of\r\nliabilities was thus the enormous sum of $145,494,005. The charges for\r\ninterest and sinking funds were $7,542,094, and the annual payment of\r\n$5,629,764, due on $87,558,482 of railroad bonded indebtedness, shows\r\nthat the rate of interest upon the bonds was high. The net revenue was\r\n$5,494,979, and there was therefore a deficit of $2,047,115. Meanwhile\r\nthe Coal & Iron Company had reported a regular deficit up to 1880,\r\nwhich, though not significant in itself, because of close relations\r\nwith the Railroad Company and the impossibility of determining how\r\nmuch the Coal Company’s rightful profits were reduced by exorbitant\r\ntransportation rates, yet made it very clear that from this source the\r\nRailroad Company could expect no aid toward the cancellation of the\r\nrailroad deficit revealed.\r\n\r\nThe combined companies were unable to earn their fixed charges: the\r\ncontinuation of the struggle to do so was sure to mean, as it had in\r\nthe past, merely a piling up of the floating debt. The coupon-funding\r\nscheme of 1877 had shown the inevitable result of temporary measures of\r\nrelief; and though business in 1880 was rapidly improving, there was\r\nneed for a radical reduction in the burden resting upon the company.\r\nPending action, a bill for foreclosure was introduced under the general\r\nmortgage of 1874.[165] A valuation of the Reading coal properties, to\r\nwhich reference has already been made, was started. It was entrusted at\r\nfirst to Mr. S. B. Whitney, chief engineer of the Coal & Iron Company,\r\nand to Mr. Frank Carver, the land agent; but was later given over to\r\nMr. Joseph S. Harris, chief engineer of the Lehigh Coal & Navigation\r\nCompany, in order to have the opinion of an unprejudiced expert.[166]\r\n\r\nThe first suggestion for a plan of reorganization came from England.\r\nThe consolidated mortgage, prior to the general mortgage, was to be\r\nforeclosed; general mortgage bonds were to be deprived of their right\r\nto sue or to foreclose; all unsecured bonds and junior mortgages were\r\nto be exchanged for preferred stock; and a $15 assessment was to be\r\nlevied upon the stock, for which collateral trust 7 per cent bonds were\r\nto be given. This assessment was relied on to pay off the floating\r\ndebt, and the new company was to start free, with but $33,564,000 of\r\nmortgage indebtedness.[167]\r\n\r\nThis plan was a step in the right direction. It recognized the validity\r\nof prior liens, followed a sound principle in providing for the\r\nfloating debt by assessments upon the stock, and relieved the company\r\nfrom the likelihood of a future failure by its treatment of the general\r\nmortgage bonds; but it was weak in that it reduced the general mortgage\r\nto the anomalous position of a bond entitled to a fixed return without\r\nthe power to enforce it. Stockholders, moreover, objected strenuously\r\nto the assessment, maintaining that business conditions were now such\r\nas to make milder measures sufficient.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1880, Mr. J. W. Jones, formerly vice-president of the\r\nReading Company, urged that an assessment on the stock was not\r\nnecessary, and proposed the following:\r\n\r\n(1) To convert the income, debenture, and convertible bonds and scrip\r\ninto second preferred stock bearing 5 per cent interest if earned;\r\n\r\n(2) To issue $15,000,000 of first preferred stock, with which to retire\r\nthe floating debt;\r\n\r\n(3) To scale the Coal Company mortgage bonds $200,000 per annum,\r\nwhich could possibly be done by consent of holders, if not, then by\r\nforeclosure.[168]\r\n\r\nThe main difference between this and the English scheme lay in the\r\ntreatment of the floating debt. It is improbable, however, that the\r\nsubstitute which this plan offered would have been sufficient, and that\r\nthe preferred stock could have brought $66, at which price alone it\r\nwould have covered the floating debt. Reading common stock was selling\r\nin the middle of the month at 16⅜; general mortgage 6s were bringing\r\nonly 74¼, while debentures and convertible 7s were being quoted at 28\r\nand 37 respectively.\r\n\r\nIn October a representative of the English bondholders arrived in\r\nPhiladelphia for the purpose of examining into the condition of the\r\ncompany, and the following month agreed with the board of managers\r\nupon a reorganization committee to act in the United States. “The\r\nprobabilities are,” said this gentleman (Mr. Thomas Wilde Powell),\r\n“that it will be found that the bondholders in London will be willing\r\nto do as they did in the case of the Erie, that is, fund a reasonable\r\nnumber of coupons ... for the purpose of setting at liberty a portion\r\nof the revenue to pay unfunded claims.”[169] The next move in the\r\nreorganization of the company came, however, not from this committee\r\nbut from President Gowen, the man who had led the Reading into the\r\npurchase of coal lands, and who still remained in office in spite of\r\nthe hostility shown toward him. His scheme comprised two parts: the\r\nfirst an issue of income bonds with which to pay off the floating debt\r\n(together with $5,000,000 mortgage bonds); the second a grand general\r\nmortgage to retire existing indebtedness. The plan in more detail was\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n(1) The company was to create $34,300,000 deferred income bonds, on\r\nwhich interest was to be deferred to a dividend of 6 per cent on the\r\ncommon stock. After this amount had been paid the bonds were to take\r\nall revenue up to 6 per cent and were then to rank _pari passu_ with\r\nthe common shares for further dividends. The debentures were to be\r\nissued at 30 per cent of their par value, or $15 per bond; and before\r\nselling or disposing of said bonds in the market the option of taking\r\na _pro rata_ share was to be first offered to the stockholders of the\r\ncompany.[170]\r\n\r\n(2) A more permanent relief for the company was to be obtained\r\nfrom the proposal to issue a new long time or perpetual 5 per cent\r\nfunding mortgage of $150,000,000, divided into two classes, A and B,\r\nof $75,000,000 each: class A having priority of lien and interest\r\ncharge over class B. With this issue it was proposed, by purchase or\r\nexchange, to retire all outstanding indebtedness, and to acquire by\r\npurchase the securities of the companies owning the leased lines. It\r\nwas estimated that $140,000,000 of the new issue would provide for all\r\nof this, the total interest on which would be $7,000,000, as against\r\nfixed charges for interest, sinking funds, and rentals, of $10,657,116,\r\nmaking an annual saving of $3,657,116.[171] Mr. Gowen did not expect\r\nto secure so large an annual reduction, owing to the impossibility of\r\npurchasing the higher securities and the probable appreciation in value\r\nof the lower ones; but he did expect to realize in all a saving of some\r\n$2,700,000.\r\n\r\nIn part this plan was commendable; in part it was inadequate, and\r\nin part it relied on a mere juggling with words. The proposal to\r\nunify all classes of indebtedness by a grand consolidated 5 per cent\r\nmortgage was a good one, both in the simplification of accounts which\r\nwas to be expected, and in the reduction in fixed charges so far as\r\nthis reduction went; but on the one hand a reduction of $2,700,000\r\nin charges was too little for a company which had reported for that\r\nvery year a deficit of $2,000,000, and on the other hand too little\r\nallowance was made for the difficulty of forcing securityholders\r\nwithout a foreclosure sale to submit to a definitive scaling down\r\nof their holdings, with not even a preferred stock to show for the\r\nsacrifice. In its handling of the floating debt, the plan was a\r\nsecond edition of Mr. Jones’s stock-selling scheme, with all the good\r\npoints left out. What justification there could have been for calling\r\nsecurities, such as the deferred incomes, “bonds,” which were to\r\nbe issued for no definite time, ranked even after the common stock\r\nfor dividends, and were of such doubtful character that Mr. Gowen\r\nhimself proposed to sell them for one-third of their face value, does\r\nnot appear; unless it be that the lack of voting power, itself a\r\ndisadvantage, entitled them to the more respected name. The deferred\r\nincome bonds were a device for saddling the holders of the unsecured\r\ndebt with a worthless certificate which they might be induced to accept\r\nbecause of its name, and to which not even the Reading stockholders\r\ncould object. Furthermore, even if the creditors had been eager for\r\nthis new issue, in itself it would not have been sufficient. The issue,\r\nif taken up, would have yielded $10,200,000. It was proposed besides\r\nto sell $5,000,000 of unissued general mortgage bonds, which, after\r\nthe success of the deferred income bonds, it was presumed would sell\r\nat par. Income bonds and general mortgage together promised a total\r\nof $15,200,000, or more than $1,000,000 over cash requirements after\r\ncommissions had been paid.[172]\r\n\r\nHowever poor the prospect, there was no lack of syndicate guarantee.\r\nIn November, 1880, a London syndicate agreed to deposit with an\r\nAmerican bank, to be named by the company, the sum of $2,058,000,\r\nto be forfeited in case they failed to take at the issue price all\r\ndeferred income bonds not taken by the shareholders. This syndicate\r\nfurther agreed that the company might retain, up to $1,000,000, out\r\nof the deposit money, whatever might be necessary to make up a second\r\ninstalment of $4 on such neglected bonds.[173] Nothing was asked from\r\nthe company in return except the chance to sell the bonds purchased\r\nat a premium. “As long as the bond- and shareholders find the money,”\r\nremarked the London _Times_, “there is nothing to be said. In all\r\nprobability, however, these deferred bonds will become a medium for the\r\nvery worst kind of gambling, and their chances for a dividend appear to\r\nus to be very small.”[174]\r\n\r\nIn December Mr. Gowen’s plan received the approval of the American\r\ncommittee and of the board of managers of the company. Bondholders were\r\nin no way injured by the worthlessness of the deferred income bonds,\r\nand only the most far-sighted could be expected to have demanded a\r\nlarger reduction in their claims. The same month a meeting of London\r\nbond- and shareholders passed unanimously a resolution expressing\r\nconfidence in President Gowen, and adopting his scheme.[175] Opposition\r\ncame from the influential London banking firm of McCalmont Bros., and\r\nthe struggle centred about the annual election set for January 10,\r\n1881. The last of November or first of December President Gowen issued\r\na circular in which he said: “As I am about to visit Europe on business\r\nof the company, and as it is possible that I may not return until the\r\nfirst week in January, I think it proper to call your attention to\r\nthe fact that it is highly important that all shareholders who can\r\npossibly do so should attend the annual meeting in Philadelphia on\r\nthe second Monday in January. An effort will undoubtedly be made at\r\nthe next election to control the management of the company in the\r\ninterest of rival lines, and if the effort is successful the future\r\nof the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad Company will be little, if\r\nany, better than that of the Philadelphia & Erie Railroad Company, or\r\nof the Northern Central Railroad Company.”[176] In Europe, or, more\r\nstrictly speaking, in London, Gowen busied himself in placing his\r\ndeferred income bonds, with apparently a very considerable measure\r\nof success. As to the result of the coming election he professed\r\nabsolute confidence. It made little difference, said he, which way\r\nthe McCalmonts decided to vote their shares. He could be elected\r\nwithout any English votes at all, and with the backing of the English\r\nbondholders who had resolved to support him, the matter was not at\r\nall in doubt.[177] On January 4, six days before the date set for the\r\nelection, Gowen actually issued a prospectus for his new income and\r\nmortgage loans, and cabled to Vice-President Keim that he was satisfied\r\nthat he could dispose of the general mortgage A bonds at 110 and the\r\ngeneral mortgage B bonds at par.[178]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in America both parties had recourse to the courts: the\r\nMcCalmonts, to prevent the issue of the deferred income bonds, and\r\nthe friends of Mr. Gowen to get the election postponed in order to\r\ngive the president time to return from Europe. The latter suit was the\r\nfirst decided. Judge McKennan, of the United States Circuit Court,\r\nrefused to grant an order, but unofficially advised postponement. The\r\nboard of managers therefore withdrew the notice of the annual meeting,\r\nand on January 12 voted to postpone it indefinitely. Counsel for the\r\nMcCalmonts then made application to the Court of Common Pleas in\r\nPhiladelphia for a mandamus to compel the board to call a meeting. They\r\nobtained a peremptory mandamus on January 24, but accepted the date of\r\nMarch 14 as satisfactory, and forbore further proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe matter of the deferred income bonds was complicated by a full and\r\ncomplete authorization which Mr. Gowen had before obtained from the\r\nCircuit Court for the issue of his bonds. The request of the McCalmonts\r\nwas twofold: the court was prayed to revoke the previous decree, and\r\nto enjoin any further action in the negotiation or consummation of the\r\nsaid scheme; or, failing this, to direct the officers of the company\r\nand the receivers to refrain from the issue of the bonds until the form\r\nthereof should have been settled by the said court, and also until\r\ndeposit with the receivers should have been made of the $2,058,000\r\nprovided as a guarantee.[179] The first request sought a prohibition\r\nof the issue; the second attempted to delay the negotiation of the\r\nbonds until the annual election should have passed and the McCalmonts\r\nshould have had a chance to obtain control. The immediate result was\r\nthe transference to Philadelphia of the $2,058,000 guaranteed, from\r\nits place of deposit in London. In February the McCalmonts obtained a\r\nrevocation of the original grant of authority for the deferred income\r\nbonds, a continuance of the suit for a preliminary injunction, and\r\nan order restraining the respondents from “making any agreement or\r\nordering any act by which the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad Company\r\n[might] be definitely bound touching the deferred bond plan or the\r\nproposed mortgage loan of $150,000,000.”[180]\r\n\r\nIn January the Coal & Iron Company quietly held its annual election,\r\nand chose Mr. Gowen president. As the time for the postponed election\r\nof the Railroad Company came round, the activity of both sides became\r\nintense. Both Gowen, who was still in London, and the McCalmonts issued\r\ncalls for proxies. The former appealed to the shareholders to save\r\nthe property from passing into the hands of the Pennsylvania Central\r\nRailroad Company, which he said was believed to be the ruling power\r\nbehind the McCalmont litigation. The latter objected vigorously to this\r\ncharge, and pointed out that the Reading managers held only 16,500\r\nshares of the company’s stock, and that some of them had barely enough\r\nto qualify them for the positions which they held.[181] The McCalmonts,\r\nfurthermore, applied to the courts for an injunction to prevent Gowen\r\nfrom voting on the shares pledged as collateral for the floating\r\ndebt. They maintained with some justification that these shares could\r\nnot legally be voted, and that it was particularly illegal for the\r\npresident to use them to elect himself.[182]\r\n\r\nOn March 12 the Court of Common Pleas issued a decree regulating the\r\nconditions under which the election should be held, providing for the\r\nseparate count of votes of shares transferred three months before the\r\nelection, and for the ultimate reference of all disputed points to\r\nthe Court. By this time Mr. Gowen had become alarmed at the apparent\r\nstrength of the McCalmonts, and had come to realize that a possible\r\ndisenfranchisement of a part of his own holdings on the ground of too\r\nrecent transference might lessen his chances of retaining control. He\r\nrecalled, however, that the annual meeting had been postponed from\r\nJanuary 10 to March 7, and finally to March 14. This, it occurred to\r\nhim, might transform it from a regular to a special meeting, and might,\r\naccording to the terms of the company’s charter, make necessary the\r\npresence and vote of a majority of all the shares outstanding, instead\r\nof a simple majority of all the shares on hand. If this should be true\r\na disenfranchisement of his holdings would be of less importance; for\r\nwhether disenfranchised or not, these would form part of the total\r\nshares outstanding, of which an absolute majority would be required.\r\n\r\nOn March 12, two days before the appointed date, Mr. Gowen issued a\r\nletter to the shareholders. “I hold,” said he, “up to the present time,\r\nthe proxies of 1921 shareholders of the company, owning 359,500 shares\r\nof the capital stock, being very considerably more than a majority of\r\nall the shares.... Of the shares for which I hold proxies, so large\r\na proportion, however, may possibly be disenfranchised by failure to\r\nregister, that if the legal meeting of the stockholders is held on\r\nMonday next, and it should subsequently be determined by the Court\r\nthat three months’ prior registry is essential to confer the right of\r\nvoting, it may be possible that the wishes of the great majority of\r\n_bona fide_ shareholders may be overruled by a minority.... I have\r\ndetermined to abstain from attending the meeting, and I earnestly\r\nrequest all shareholders who support the present management to absent\r\nthemselves from the meeting on Monday, and thus to give legal effect\r\nto their wishes by making it impossible for the minority to secure the\r\nattendance of a quorum....”[183]\r\n\r\nMr. Gowen’s friends, English and American, followed his suggestion;\r\nand at the meeting on Monday but 211,095 out of 687,663 registered\r\nshares appeared to vote. The immediate result was the almost unanimous\r\nelection of Mr. Bond, the candidate of the McCalmonts, which was\r\nfollowed by litigation on the part of Mr. Gowen, disputing the legality\r\nof the election. By the terms of the decree under which the election\r\nhad been held, the matter came first before the Court of Common\r\nPleas, which, on April 9, decided that the meeting had been a legal\r\none, and that the officers then voted for by the McCalmonts had been\r\nduly elected. With the above court ranged against him, Mr. Gowen took\r\nappeal to the Supreme Court of the state, and meanwhile declined to\r\nsurrender his position. On April 11 the new board proceeded to the\r\nReading offices in Philadelphia, made formal demand for admittance, and\r\nwere refused. On April 22 President Bond issued formal notice of his\r\nelection. An injunction was asked against Mr. Gowen, but was held back\r\nuntil the Supreme Court should have taken action. Meanwhile the old\r\nboard of managers announced that if a decree supporting the decision of\r\nthe Court of Common Pleas should be rendered they would make no further\r\nopposition; and the transfer agents of the company in Philadelphia\r\nand New York refused to transfer any stock until the dispute should\r\nhave been settled. On April 19 an order of the United States Court\r\ninterfered with Mr. Gowen’s exclusive possession, and compelled him\r\nto furnish to Messrs. Frank S. Bond, etc., suitable accommodations\r\nin the offices of the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad Company, with\r\nfree access to all books and papers. In May the Supreme Court rendered\r\nits decision, holding the meeting of March 14 to have been a regular\r\nmeeting, and a majority of all the stock outstanding not to have been\r\nrequired for a quorum. Gowen asked for a rehearing, which was denied,\r\nand in June, nearly four months after the election, he grudgingly\r\nacknowledged Mr. Bond and his associates as the legally elected\r\npresident and board of managers.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time the deferred income bond scheme had not remained\r\nuntouched. In April, 1881, on application of the McCalmonts, the\r\nUnited States Circuit Court at Philadelphia had granted a preliminary\r\ninjunction against it. “Whatever power the defendant has in the\r\npremises can only be found in the general authority to borrow money,”\r\nsaid Judge McKennan, and went on to state that the issue did not\r\nconstitute a loan, because a loan implied reimbursement, and the income\r\nbonds were redeemable at no special time.[184] Mr. Gowen promptly\r\nproposed to make them redeemable, and insisted that this made them\r\nstill more desirable. A week later the $150,000,000 general mortgage\r\nwas also enjoined.[185]\r\n\r\nOnce out of the presidency Mr. Gowen endeavored to induce the\r\nMcCalmonts to accept his plan. If they would adopt the deferred income\r\nbond scheme, he said in an address to shareholders, he would resign the\r\nreceivership of the road at once, give bonds never to stand for the\r\npresidency again, and further coöperate with them in selecting a new\r\nboard of directors. As an alternative he offered to buy the McCalmont\r\nshares at $40 each, and threatened to beat that party at the next\r\nelection if it refused.[186] In September he assured the stockholders\r\nthat he could without difficulty put the road upon its feet. “If Bond\r\nand his colleagues will resign and reinstate the old management,” he\r\ncabled from London, “and advise me by cable of the change, I can,\r\nbefore sailing on Saturday, procure sufficient advances against the\r\nproceeds of preferred [deferred?] income bonds and new 5 per cent\r\nconsols to pay the floating debt, receivers’ certificates, and all\r\narrears of interest.”[187] Finally, appealing to Mr. Bond direct, Gowen\r\nmade formal application that the new board should adopt his plan after\r\nchanging the form of the proposed obligations by making them payable in\r\n100 or 200 years.[188] Bond refused. He pointed out that the deferred\r\nincome bondholders would be in constant conflict with the management\r\nin their endeavor to secure dividends on their holdings, and would\r\nattempt to prevent proper and necessary expenditures upon the property\r\nfrom current net revenues. He declared that it was questionable whether\r\nthe company had authority to sell its unsecured obligations below par,\r\nand that in any case the process would be enormously expensive; and,\r\nfurther, that the language of the obligation did not limit the payment\r\nof interest to the source of net revenue only, but might be construed\r\nto compel the declaration of 6 per cent on the income bonds whenever\r\n6 per cent should be paid on the common stock.[189] Failing in his\r\nattempts to win over his opponents, Gowen turned his energies toward\r\nsecuring their defeat.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile President Bond brought forward a plan of his own. He had\r\ngrasped three points of weakness in Gowen’s scheme, namely,—\r\n\r\n(1) The issue of a mass of worthless obligations in the deferred income\r\nbonds;\r\n\r\n(2) The high level of fixed charges which a $150,000,000 5 per cent\r\nmortgage entailed;\r\n\r\n(3) The lack of any security which had a right to interest only when\r\nearned, and which might be given to the bondholders in return for\r\nsacrifices which they would otherwise refuse to make.\r\n\r\nHe proposed, therefore, to create a general consolidated mortgage\r\nto cover all the property of the Reading Railroad and Coal & Iron\r\nCompanies, together with the interest of both companies in all other\r\ncorporations and property, whether owned or controlled by lease or\r\notherwise. This mortgage was to be junior to the consolidated and\r\nto the improvement mortgages only, but was to contain a provision\r\nby which, as bonds under these senior mortgages should be retired,\r\nadditional bonds might be issued under the new mortgage, which was\r\neventually to become a first lien upon all the properties of both\r\ncompanies.[190] The total was to be $150,000,000, to be divided into\r\ntwo series: of which series A, for $90,000,000, was to run for fifty\r\nyears, and was to have a prior lien over series B upon the revenues\r\nfor interest at the rate of 4½ per cent, with a right to enforce\r\nforeclosure in case of a twelve months’ default; and series B was to\r\nrun sixty years, and was to carry interest at 3 per cent, with a right\r\nto enforce foreclosure in case of a three years’ default. In prosperous\r\nyears series B might receive more than 3 per cent: thus the mortgage\r\nprovided that from current net revenue applicable to dividends it\r\nshould get 1½ per cent additional interest before any dividend should\r\nbe paid on the stock of the company; after that 3 per cent might be\r\npaid on the capital stock, and then 1½ per cent additional might be\r\npaid on series B; it being understood that the interest in excess of\r\n3 per cent should not be cumulative, but was to be paid only from\r\ncurrent net revenues of the company otherwise applicable to dividends.\r\nThese two issues of unequal worth were to be used for different\r\npurposes. Series A was to be in part reserved to retire the senior\r\nobligations, and in part to be sold to pay off the general mortgage\r\nbonds, the general mortgage scrip, the income bonds, the floating debt\r\nof the Railroad and Coal & Iron Companies secured by collateral, the\r\nreceivers’ obligations, and the mortgages on real estate that could be\r\npaid off. Series B was to be exchanged for the junior obligations, such\r\nas the debenture or convertible loans, or was to be held in reserve\r\nfor subsequent acquisition of the guaranteed stock or obligations of\r\naffiliated corporations of the Railroad and Coal & Iron Companies.\r\n\r\nWhat this meant for the immediate future was that all prior liens\r\nwere to remain untouched, while everything from the general mortgage\r\ndown was to be funded into the new obligations. In some ways this\r\nresembled the earlier scheme of Mr. Gowen, since in each case there\r\nwas to be a $150,000,000 general mortgage in two parts, of which one\r\npart was to have priority over the other, and in each case this grand\r\nmortgage was to be used ultimately to retire all previously existing\r\nindebtedness. An innovation was now made, however, in the difference\r\nintroduced between the two series. In Gowen’s scheme the amount of\r\neach series was to be the same, and each was to fare alike, except\r\nfor the priority of series A; in that of President Bond, series A was\r\nto be half again as large as series B, and was to bear a higher rate\r\nof compulsory interest; although, a point of extreme importance, the\r\nreturn upon series B was to run from a minimum of 3 per cent to a\r\nmaximum of 6 per cent whenever the road should earn it. Thus President\r\nBond gained two things: he reduced the rate of interest which his\r\nnew bonds could claim in any year from 5 per cent (as under Gowen’s\r\nscheme) to an average of something under 4 per cent, which would yet,\r\nin prosperous times, net them as much as the old bonds surrendered; and\r\nas a still further concession, he gave to the 3 per cent bonds a term\r\nof sixty instead of fifty years, raising their value to that extent.\r\nAs the various existing issues of bonds had different market values,\r\nhe thought it proper to equalize these values in the exchange by the\r\ngrant of a bonus in stock, for which the capital stock of the company\r\nwas to be increased one-third. Here were two of Gowen’s problems in a\r\nfair way of solution: the reduction of fixed charges was accomplished,\r\nwhile some incentive was given to the junior bondholders to assent.\r\nScarcely less from the point of view of sound finance was the gain\r\nfrom the abandonment of the anomalous deferred income bond scheme,\r\nwith its $34,300,000 of worthless speculative securities. Instead,\r\nthe floating debt, under President Bond’s plan, was to be cared for by\r\nthe sale of series A bonds, not at one-third their face value, but as\r\nnear par as possible; by the best of the company’s new securities, in\r\nother words, and not by the worst. And, finally, the acquisition of\r\nthe securities of subsidiary roads was provided for rather ingeniously\r\nby the conversion into series B bonds of $10,527,900 convertible 7 per\r\ncent bonds, against which had perforce been reserved an equal amount\r\nof stock. Conversion released the stock, which became a free asset\r\navailable for any uses to which the company saw fit to apply it.\r\n\r\nYet while the advance which the plan of President Bond marks over\r\nthat of President Gowen may be recognized, its defects must also\r\nbe observed. It was, in the first place, in common with all other\r\nschemes suggested, too mild, too little drastic in its operations.\r\nThe condition of the Reading companies was desperate in the extreme.\r\nBy President Bond’s own figures the previous five years had shown a\r\ndeficit of $11,479,217, or an average loss per annum of $2,295,853.\r\nThe net earnings for 1881 by the same computation had been $8,418,009,\r\nand the fixed charges $11,265,666.[191] What was needed was a radical\r\nscaling down of indebtedness, to take effect not in the far distant\r\nfuture but at once. President Gowen, face to face with a similar\r\nsituation, had evolved a reduction in fixed charges from about\r\n$11,000,000 to about $7,000,000, but had explained that, owing to\r\nthe impossibility of retiring all of the prior liens at once, the\r\nactual figures would be approximately $7,957,000. President Bond, less\r\noptimistic, or more honest, stated that the ultimate charge under\r\nhis plan would be about $6,000,000; but that the immediate reduction\r\nwould be to about $8,339,000 only, scarcely more than $100,000 below\r\nthe net earnings of the current year. Both estimates would probably\r\nhave been under the mark; but the relief which President Bond proposed\r\nwas utterly inadequate even on his own showing. A margin of surplus\r\nearnings which could be wiped out in a single month was no answer to\r\nthe demand for a restoration of the Reading companies to solvency.\r\nIn regard to the floating debt, too, Bond’s plan left something to\r\nbe desired, in that it provided for no assessment, but cared for the\r\nfloating obligations by the sale of bonds. The danger in relying\r\nupon the sale of securities to supply the cash requirements of a\r\nbankrupt road has been mentioned in connection with Mr. Gowen’s\r\nscheme, as indeed at other times before. At best it is advisable only\r\nin prosperous times, and when the bonds offered are of high grade;\r\nand though the series A bonds might perhaps have been considered high\r\ngrade, the prosperity of 1880 was not repeated in 1881, and a year of\r\nbankruptcy and litigation had not improved the Reading’s credit. That\r\nthe plan failed, however, was due neither to its inadequacy nor to its\r\nmethod of dealing with the floating debt; but rather to the resolute\r\nand uncompromising opposition of Mr. Gowen and his friends, and to the\r\ndetermination of the junior securityholders to stand out for better\r\nterms. This twofold resistance caused a syndicate of bankers, which had\r\nbeen relied upon to place the new loan, ultimately to reject it, and\r\nthe plan fell through.[192]\r\n\r\nTo return now to Mr. Gowen. This gentleman had been strengthening his\r\nfollowing in every possible way, and had secured one ally of particular\r\nimportance in the person of Mr. Vanderbilt, who in October, 1881, was\r\nreported to be buying largely of the company’s stock. Early in November\r\nMr. Gowen and President Bond both issued addresses to the shareholders.\r\nThe former maintained that although the present management had been\r\nin power for over four months it had done nothing to extricate the\r\ncompany from its difficulties, and promised that if elected he would\r\n“retain the office long enough to place the company in a good financial\r\ncondition, by completing the issue of deferred income bonds and by\r\nissuing and selling the 5 per cent consolidated mortgage bonds, the\r\nresult of which will be the resumption of dividends upon the company’s\r\nshares.”[193] The business prospects of the company were never better,\r\nhe continued, and the wisdom of the purchase of the great anthracite\r\ncoal estate was being demonstrated. Bond, on the other hand, alluded to\r\nthe failure of Mr. Gowen’s many promises, to the wasteful expenditure\r\nof money, to the coal speculations in which the road had been engaged,\r\nto the payment of unearned dividends, and to other points of Gowen’s\r\npolicy, actual or alleged;[194] and his statements were repeated by the\r\nMcCalmonts in spite of Mr. Gowen’s vehement denials.[195]\r\n\r\nThe election was held from January 9 to January 14, 1882. There were\r\ncast 493,601 votes, of which Gowen received 270,984 and Bond 222,617; a\r\nresult mainly due to the 72,000 Vanderbilt shares voted for Mr. Gowen.\r\nThe same meeting approved by resolution Gowen’s financial plans, and\r\ncalled on the incoming board of managers to carry them into effect. To\r\nclear the way a test suit was brought in the Supreme Court of the state\r\nof Pennsylvania, and a close decision obtained favoring the issue.[196]\r\nCounsel for the McCalmont Bros. petitioned in the Circuit Court for\r\nleave to withdraw their complaint, stating that the McCalmonts had\r\ndisposed of almost all their holdings, and the Circuit Court vacated\r\nthe injunction which it had previously granted.[197]\r\n\r\nGowen’s plan was now triumphantly brought forward, with the few\r\nalterations which time had suggested. There was to be as before a\r\ndeferred income bond issue of $34,300,000, which was to retire the\r\nfloating debt; the general mortgage was to be increased in amount\r\nfrom $150,000,000 to $160,000,000, but was still to be divided into\r\ntwo series, equal in amount, and differing in privileges only on the\r\npoint of priority of lien; of which series A was ultimately to exchange\r\nfor the senior, series B for the junior obligations of the company.\r\n$13,500,000 of the first series and $10,000,000 of the second series\r\nwere to be put out at once, and $4,000,000 convertible adjustment\r\nscrip were to be issued to settle back coupons. Time had apparently\r\nmade more modest Mr. Gowen’s estimate of the saving to be secured; for\r\ninstead of not more than $7,000,000 as before, he now hoped for fixed\r\ncharges of not more than $8,000,000; but with undaunted optimism he\r\nmade up for this admission by glowing pictures of what the company in\r\nthe future was going to earn. “Net earnings last year” (1881), said\r\nhe, “were over $10,000,000—in 1882 they may be expected to reach\r\n$11,000,000, and they will before long be over $12,000,000. With net\r\nearnings of $12,000,000, and fixed charges of $8,000,000, there will\r\nremain a dividend fund of $4,000,000, equal to 6 per cent on the share\r\ncapital, and 6 per cent upon the par, or 20 per cent upon the issue\r\nprice, of the deferred income bonds. “In order to get the property out\r\nof the hands of the receivers an earnest effort was made to sell the\r\n$13,500,000 series A bonds of which mention has been made, but at the\r\nminimum price of 98 subscriptions for but $723,500 were received, and\r\nthe company was obliged to have recourse to the $5,000,000 unissued\r\ngeneral mortgage 7 per cent bonds, which it fortunately had at its\r\ndisposal. Even before this the management had been forced to abandon\r\nany immediate attempt to retire the old general mortgage bonds,[198]\r\nand had been compelled to answer inquiries as to the reasons for a\r\ndecline in the price of the deferred income bonds. On February 28\r\nthe receivers of the Railroad and Coal & Iron Companies formally\r\nsurrendered the control of the property to the officers of those\r\ncorporations.\r\n\r\nOne of the first acts of the reconstructed company was the lease for\r\n999 years of the Central Railroad of New Jersey. This road in many\r\nways formed a natural complement to the Reading system. Like it, it\r\nwas a coal road, carrying something less than half as great a tonnage\r\nas the Reading itself, and owning extensive coal lands in the Wyoming\r\nregion; while in location it supplied the necessary connection between\r\nthe Reading lines and New York. At a later date Mr. Joseph S. Harris\r\ntestified that all the business of the Reading coming from the South or\r\nSouthwest went to New York over the Central; while, on the other hand,\r\nbusiness from the Northwest was carried by the Jersey Central from\r\nScranton, where its lines began, to Bethlehem, and was there handed to\r\nthe Reading for transportation to Philadelphia.[199] The advantages\r\nof the Central to the Reading were thus enumerated by General Traffic\r\nManager Bell in 1885: “The joint traffic with the Central Railroad,\r\noutside of coal, and outside of passengers, adds $1,500,000 to the\r\nrevenue of the old Reading system. By means of the Lehigh & Susquehanna\r\ndivision of the Central Road we extend from Phillipsburg to Scranton\r\nor Green Ridge through the entire Lehigh Valley; that system feeds\r\nour North Pennsylvania line; it is our connection for the Catawissa\r\nsystem by way of Tamanend and Tamaqua; it is the connecting link in\r\nthe cross line or Allentown system; it creates the shortest line from\r\ninterior Pennsylvania, and from Northwest Pennsylvania to New York\r\nwaters. Through the operations of the lease we reach the largest slate\r\nterritory in Pennsylvania, and the largest iron producing furnaces\r\nanywhere in this country, with the exception of Pittsburg.”[200] In\r\n1883 the Central was bankrupt with no immediate prospect of recovering\r\nfrom its difficulties, and had therefore an incentive to accept any\r\narrangement by which interest on its obligations should be paid; while\r\nMr. Gowen, with misplaced confidence in his scheme of reorganization,\r\nwas ready to put fresh burdens on his road in the hope of future gain.\r\n\r\nRumors of a lease were abroad in 1882, and after the termination of the\r\nReading receivership the operation was pushed to a speedy conclusion.\r\nThe Reading undertook to assume all the obligations of the Central,\r\nand to pay 6 per cent on its capital stock then outstanding, as well\r\nas $18,000 annually for maintaining the corporate organization of the\r\nlessor. In case any of the Central bonds should be retired, or rentals\r\nor interest reduced, the rental to be paid by the Reading was likewise\r\nto be reduced. The roadbed and rolling stock of the Central was to be\r\nmaintained undiminished, but if the Reading should make any additions\r\nor improvements, or if from its own funds it should pay off any of\r\nthe Central’s obligations, it was to receive equivalent bonds with\r\ninterest not exceeding 6 per cent from the Central Company. The lease\r\nwas terminable on 60 days’ notice in case the lessee should fail at any\r\ntime to carry out its provisions.[201] This involved something more\r\nthan a nominal obligation. The net earnings of the Jersey Central in\r\n1882 had been $5,091,072, while the sum due for rentals, interest, 6\r\nper cent dividends, etc., had mounted up to $5,898,087, not including\r\npayments on car trusts or certain contingent obligations. Broadly\r\nspeaking, the Reading proposed to guarantee 6 per cent on the stock of\r\na road which had failed because unable to meet its fixed charges; and\r\nhowever great the ultimate advantages, it is apparent that the prospect\r\nof a drain upon the Reading Company was real. In order to get the road\r\nout of receivers’ hands, the Reading had further to take care of a\r\nfloating debt of $2,062,000, and to compromise with certain creditors\r\nby settling back interest on their bonds. This was done, and on May\r\n29, 1883, possession formally passed over. The same day was concluded\r\nanother arrangement, whereby the Central of New Jersey leased the\r\ncoal and railroad companies comprised in the Lehigh Coal & Navigation\r\nCompany for one-third of their gross receipts, and the Philadelphia\r\n& Reading Railroad became liable for the faithful execution of the\r\ncontract. The Reading agreed that the Lehigh coal lands should be\r\ndeveloped _pari passu_ with its own, so that the product of the two\r\nestates should be constantly as 28 to 72 until the Lehigh production\r\nshould reach 3,000,000 tons. The rental of the road was not in any year\r\nto be less than $1,414,400, nor more than a sum rising from $1,728,700\r\nbefore 1887 to $1,885,800 from 1887 to 1892, and $2,043,000 after 1892,\r\nplus certain minor payments; and there was provision for arbitration of\r\nany disputes which might arise.[202]\r\n\r\nThe year 1883 now seemed to find the Reading imbued with new life.\r\nEarnings increased, both gross and net, fixed charges as reported\r\nrose less rapidly, and the net profits for the year, or balance on\r\nall operations, showed a threefold increase. “The company,” said Mr.\r\nGowen, “has now surmounted the difficulties of the last four eventful\r\nyears.”[203] The annual meeting in January was a genuine love-feast,\r\nmarked by the presentation of resolutions highly flattering to Mr.\r\nGowen. “We trust,” said one, “we thankfully appreciate your herculean\r\nefforts in our behalf, in the face of unparalleled difficulties and\r\nobstacles, in rescuing our property from bankruptcy against the\r\nmalignant and determined efforts of its enemies and conspirators to\r\nforeclose and wreck it.” “As citizens of this great commonwealth,” said\r\nanother, “we beg to add our gratitude and admiration for your untiring,\r\nbrave, honest, and able devotion, which has preserved the Philadelphia\r\n& Reading Company intact, and has fairly started it on a broader\r\ncareer of usefulness.”[204] Not less extraordinary was the further\r\naction of this harmonious meeting. In the first place, it authorized\r\nthe creation of a collateral trust loan of $12,000,000 for the purpose\r\nof paying the floating debt, the balance due upon the purchase of\r\nCentral Railroad Company of New Jersey stock, and the retirement of the\r\noutstanding income mortgage bonds. What, may be inquired, had become\r\nof the deferred income bonds of which Mr. Gowen had been so proud,\r\nand the $5,000,000 additional first series consols which with them\r\nwere to cover the floating debt, if a new collateral loan was needed\r\nfor the purpose for which they had been considered ample? As for the\r\npurchase of Jersey Central shares, an account would require a chapter\r\nin itself. The intent had been to secure more complete control of\r\nthis subsidiary road. The purchase had been made on margin in May. By\r\nJanuary, 1884, more funds were necessary to carry the stock; and as\r\nthe business depression grew acute, the Reading was obliged to seek a\r\ntime loan from Mr. Vanderbilt, and to pledge the purchased securities\r\nas collateral therefor. When the loan matured Reading was no better off\r\nthan it had been before, and Vanderbilt, who seldom mixed philanthropy\r\nwith business, sold the stock. The original purchase had been at 78;\r\nthe prices obtained when the stock was thrown on the market ranged from\r\n57 to 50, and the Reading lost the difference, besides those advantages\r\nwhich it had expected to gain.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the meeting proposed a dividend of 21 per cent\r\non the preferred stock, representing arrears due, and of 3 per cent\r\non the common; both cash, and to be paid in case the collateral loan\r\nshould succeed.[205] In order to give shareholders time to consider,\r\nan adjournment was taken for two weeks, after which the dividend on\r\nthe preferred stock was approved, though that on the common was not.\r\nIt seems almost superfluous to insist upon the folly of this dividend.\r\nThe Reading had not, in reality, “surmounted the difficulties of the\r\nlast four eventful years.” Scarcely any of the benefits promised by Mr.\r\nGowen’s plan of reorganization had been secured; fixed charges had not\r\nbeen reduced, because it had been found impossible to get creditors to\r\ntake new securities in exchange for the old, and equally impossible to\r\nsell any considerable amount of the new securities for cash. While old\r\ncharges had remained unabated, new charges had been added through the\r\nlease of the Jersey Central, new car trusts, and the like, and the very\r\ngain in earnings which might have been construed as favorable was due\r\nto increased mileage, and was not proportional to the growth of the\r\nsystem.[206] A fitting sequel to Mr. Gowen’s words and acts was the\r\nscrip payment for labor and supplies which took place in May, 1884, and\r\nthe accompanying fall in the prices of the company’s securities. On\r\nJune 2 the company again passed into receivers’ hands. The same judges\r\nwere applied to as in 1880, and the same receivers were appointed,\r\nexcept that Mr. Gowen, who had given up the presidency of the company,\r\nwas replaced by Mr. George de Keim, his successor.[207]\r\n\r\nThe various creditors had now to do what should have been done before,\r\nand, by lightening the charges upon the road, to put it in a position\r\nwhere its solvency could be maintained. The chances for obtaining\r\nradical action from the bondholders were somewhat brighter, since\r\neven the most obstinate were being forced to realize that no halfway\r\nmeasures would avail; and a reasonable solution was even thus early\r\nhinted at in the suggestion that some of the bonds under which the road\r\nwas staggering should be replaced by stock. Nevertheless, we shall\r\nfind in this reorganization a slow working out of the requirements for\r\na plan, and a slow process of at least partial reconcilement to the\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nThe receivers’ report was issued in October, but contained little\r\nnot known or suspected before. From November 30, 1883, to June\r\n2, 1884, there had been a net loss in operation for the Railroad\r\nCompany of $2,322,282, and for the Coal & Iron Company of $1,049,702,\r\nshowing conclusively the condition of the companies. The total\r\nbonded indebtedness was $94,613,042; a total to be compared with\r\nthe $78,101,894 of four years previous. The total floating debt\r\nwas $16,549,968 as compared with $10,254,766 at the beginning of\r\nthe previous receivership. Including the Central of New Jersey,\r\nthe total fixed charges for the Railroad and Coal & Iron Companies\r\nwere $18,241,051; a sum which certain offsets, however, reduced to\r\n$16,584,732.[208]\r\n\r\nThe first suggestion for a reorganization came from a committee\r\nprimarily representing the general mortgage bondholders, though\r\nincluding other interests as well. The chairman was Mr. Townsend\r\nWhelen, and the committee may be taken to represent the views of the\r\nmanagement. “The present fixed charges of the company,” said Mr.\r\nWhelen, “are in round numbers $16,650,000, while the earnings of the\r\npast fiscal year are, in round numbers and after proper deductions,\r\n$12,900,000. The objects sought to be accomplished by the committee are:\r\n\r\n“(1) To reduce fixed charges to the limit of last year’s earnings;\r\n\r\n“(2) To preserve the proper order of priorities of each class of\r\nsecurities, so that no income applicable to any senior security that\r\nremains unpaid can by any possibility be diverted to paying the\r\ninterest on a junior security;\r\n\r\n“(3) To provide a method of paying the floating debt.”\r\n\r\nThe plan was, roughly, to leave the prior liens untouched, to fund\r\none-half the coupons upon the general mortgage for three years, and to\r\nconvert all of the other obligations into income bonds. Preferred stock\r\nwas to be changed from cumulative to non-cumulative; rents of leased\r\nlines, including the Central of New Jersey, were to be reduced to the\r\namounts which the properties had earned; the canal leases were to be\r\nreduced; the interest on some of the divisional coal land mortgages\r\nwas to be reduced, and on some was to be paid in full. In regard to\r\nthe floating debt the committee decided to postpone any attempt to\r\nraise money for its extinction. If the bondholders should accept\r\nthe scaling down of their indebtedness, the company might have no\r\ndifficulty in procuring cash by a collateral loan; if this should prove\r\nimpossible, the duty of providing funds would devolve upon the junior\r\nsecurities.[209] The committee found it impossible to prepare within\r\nthe short time at their disposal a complete plan of reorganization\r\nwith exact figures of present and proposed fixed charges; and it is\r\ntherefore impossible to ascertain how great was the saving which they\r\nexpected to secure.\r\n\r\nThe plan marks sufficiently well the advance which had been made since\r\nthe reorganization of 1880–3. The best that could then be imagined\r\nhad been the creation of a grand general mortgage for which the old\r\nbondholders might, but mostly did not, exchange their holdings; while\r\nnow the very first suggestion endeavored to retain for all bondholders\r\na chance for the same return as before, and found the salvation of\r\nthe company in the transformance of certain bonds from mortgage to\r\ndebenture obligations. The general criticisms which may be made are\r\nthree: first, that it was unwise to defer all provision for the\r\nfloating debt; second, that the new income bonds might better have been\r\nreplaced by stock; and third, that the probable reduction in fixed\r\ncharges would have been insufficient. So far as the committee suggested\r\nany action in relation to the floating debt, it favored a funding of\r\nit. This funding might have been either into mortgage or into income\r\nbonds: if the former, the fixed charges of the company would have been\r\nincreased, or else the other mortgage bondholders would have been\r\ncompelled to accept a lower rate of interest; if the latter, the volume\r\nof securities of slight value would have been increased, or the junior\r\nsecurities would have had to take less for their holdings. The action\r\ntaken would have gone far to determine what classes of securities\r\nwould assent, while in the absence of definite declaration it was on\r\nthe whole likely that all classes would hold off. As for the income\r\nbonds, it is in general true that they are an unsatisfactory sort of\r\nsecurity, and likely to hinder the legitimate increase of capital. Most\r\nimportant was the question of fixed charges. It will be remembered that\r\nof the first and second series 5s of the previous reorganization only\r\n$23,500,000 had been intended for immediate sale, and that of these but\r\na portion had been disposed of; and yet these consols were the only\r\nsecurities the nature of which was really changed by the Whelen plan.\r\nInterest had been optional before on the income bonds, the convertible\r\nbonds, the convertible adjustment scrip, debenture and deferred income\r\nbonds; interest was not made optional on the general mortgage or prior\r\nliens. The result would not have been, in spite of the reduction in\r\nrents and the scaling of the divisional coal mortgages, any sufficient\r\nlessening of the fixed requirements. This fact was, moreover,\r\nperceived. The board of managers, to whom the scheme was reported,\r\nconcluded a favorable opinion with the declaration, “to conclude, we\r\nare satisfied that the large economies already in operation, with those\r\nwhich are still being introduced, should be regarded as a margin to\r\nmeet adverse contingencies.... That the revenue we reckon on, though\r\nreasonably certain under such reorganization, will surely not be\r\nrealized in case the property should be torn asunder by foreclosure\r\nsale.”[210] In other words they relied, much as Mr. Gowen had done\r\ntwo years before, on a subsequent increase in earnings to ensure the\r\nsolvency of the company. A final objection made at the time was that\r\nthe plan asked too little of the junior securities.\r\n\r\nThe Whelen plan was reported to the general managers’ committee, and\r\nwas approved by them. Some slight modifications were made, and a large\r\nnumber of signatures was secured. Opposition was not slow to spring\r\nup. In February a meeting of general mortgage bondholders elected a\r\ncommittee, known as the Bartol Committee, to prepare a plan more suited\r\nto their interests. This body conferred with the Whelen Committee, and\r\ntwo members from each were selected to construct a new reorganization\r\nplan.[211] In March it reported to its constituents that it had made\r\nall the concessions which were possible without sacrificing the\r\ninterests of the general mortgage bondholders, and that in spite of\r\nthis, the negotiations had not proved successful.[212]\r\n\r\nIn April, ten months after the beginning of the receivership, the\r\nReading managers evolved a plan for dealing with the floating debt.\r\nHolders were to agree to accept renewals at intervals of three months\r\nfor three years, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent, paid at the\r\ntime of each renewal, and to hold the collateral pledged as security\r\nuntil the whole of the debt should have been discharged. In case the\r\nPhiladelphia & Reading should fail at any time punctually to pay the\r\ninterest on any of the obligations agreed to be renewed, or should\r\nfail to cause the same to be renewed, or in case nine-tenths of the\r\nfloating-debt holders should not assent to the plan, or in case an\r\nadverse judicial sale should be made, the obligation to accept further\r\nrenewals should immediately cease.[213] The scheme deservedly fell\r\nthrough. Creditors were asked to tie up their assets for three years,\r\nwith no concession in return except the payment of interest quarterly\r\nin advance; while the unofficial suggestion that the Reading pay ¼ per\r\ncent commission on each renewal was felt to be too expensive for the\r\ncompany to entertain.\r\n\r\nThe following month the Whelen and Bartol committees came out with\r\na new edition of the Whelen plan, which introduced an assessment on\r\nthe junior bonds and stock, but preserved the same method of dealing\r\nwith the old securities as before.[214] Assent to the plan was to be\r\non the condition that sufficient money should be raised to pay off\r\nthe floating debt. Interest on such debt was not to have priority of\r\npayment over interest on the general mortgage for longer than three\r\nyears; and during those three years the preference was to be limited to\r\nthat part of the floating debt secured by collateral yielding income\r\nto cover interest, or important for other reasons to be retained.\r\nThere were to be seven reorganization trustees to receive the assents\r\nof parties in interest, and to receive and hold the securities and\r\nassessments thereon pending reorganization, and when accomplished to\r\nreturn such securities duly stamped to their respective owners.[215]\r\nThe trustees were further to decide whether the assents to the plan in\r\nquestion should be considered adequate, and if they should conclude\r\non or before May 1, 1886, by a vote of six of their number, that the\r\nassents were not sufficient, they were to call into a council the\r\nmanagers of the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad Company, the receivers\r\nof that company, and the committees of the general mortgage (Bartol)\r\nand income mortgage bondholders; and this council, by a vote of four\r\nof the five interests therein represented, was to formulate a plan of\r\nreorganization adapted to the circumstances, and involving no larger\r\ncontribution in money to be paid than under the plan as then modified;\r\nand under such power the trustees were to proceed to foreclose under\r\nsuch mortgage or mortgages as they might deem advisable.[216] The\r\nplan was obviously a compromise whereby the Whelen Committee clung to\r\nthe main lines of its previous proposition, and the Bartol Committee\r\nsecured modifications which benefited the general mortgage at the\r\nexpense of the junior securities. Criticisms which applied to the\r\nearlier plan largely apply to this also; but it is to be noticed that\r\nat last the idea of funding the floating debt was abandoned for the\r\nsounder scheme of paying it off in cash. The reorganization trustees\r\nwere an innovation, but were destined to be a useful one. On the whole\r\nthe compromise was a step forward; and yet it was not more successful\r\nin obtaining assents than the scheme which had preceded it. Although\r\nthe directors approved it, as was to have been expected, the bulk of\r\nthe bondholders held off.\r\n\r\nMatters now went on in much the same old way. The seven reorganization\r\ntrustees, representing the principal interests concerned, held meeting\r\nafter meeting with no apparent result. The courts became impatient;\r\nbondholders clamored for their interest; but after the failure of\r\nthe earlier plan the way out seemed harder and harder to find. In\r\nSeptember, 1885, Mr. E. Dunbar Lockwood addressed an open letter to\r\nMr. John B. Garrett, one of the trustees, in which the following points\r\nwere made:\r\n\r\n(1) “The trustees should recognize promptly and unequivocally that the\r\nReading Railroad is bankrupt, and has not sufficient available assets\r\nto meet its obligations.\r\n\r\n(2) “Two dollars of obligations cannot be paid with one dollar and a\r\nhalf of assets, and the sooner all persons interested ... recognize\r\nthis fact, and agree to scale both principal and interest sufficient to\r\nmeet the obligations of the company and put it upon a strong financial\r\nbasis, with sufficient working capital to enable it to conduct its\r\nfuture business economically, the better it will be for all concerned.\r\n\r\n(3) “The trustees should look only at the facts as they exist ...\r\nand while endeavoring to rehabilitate the road, also bring it into\r\nharmonious relations with its adversaries.\r\n\r\n(4) “The trustees should consider the problem ... precisely as business\r\nmen consider the matter of the settlement of a bankrupt firm. The\r\nquestion at once presents itself, is it best that the company should\r\ncontinue in business, or should it be wound up?”[217]\r\n\r\nIn his reply Mr. Garrett pointed out the difficulties to be overcome,\r\nand concluded by saying that in his judgment no reorganization would be\r\nfinal that did not ensure the establishment of credit, the entrusting\r\nof the management to an interest having an actual equity in the\r\nproperty, and just expectation of pecuniary return from it, and harmony\r\nwith competing lines, coupled with due regard for the rights of the\r\npublic.[218]\r\n\r\nThe reorganization trustees by this time appeared discouraged, and\r\nthe following month called a conference of creditors at which a\r\nresolution was passed looking toward foreclosure. In November a suit\r\nwas actually begun, supplementary to a similar suit instituted a year\r\nbefore. It was during the pendency of these proceedings that the plan\r\nof reorganization devised by the reorganization trustees themselves\r\ncame out, and marked a third effort to rehabilitate the road. The first\r\nplan proposed, it will be remembered, had suggested the conversion\r\nof all of the junior securities into income bonds, plus a funding of\r\none-half the general mortgage coupons for three years; and the second\r\nhad introduced an assessment on the junior bonds and stock. This third\r\nplan, while preserving the assessment, and making it more severe,\r\nadded a provision for the conversion of general mortgage liens into\r\n3 per cent bonds, and of junior liens into preferred stock. For the\r\nultimate retirement of the prior liens a new fifty-year 5 per cent\r\nmortgage was to be created; for both the prior and general mortgage\r\nliens the difference between the return from the old bonds and that\r\nfrom the new was to be adjusted by the use of 5 per cent preferred\r\nstock, so that bondholders in prosperous times would not find their\r\nincomes diminished. Preferred stock was to be of two kinds, of which\r\nthe first was to go to satisfy the general mortgage bondholders and\r\nfor assessments, while the second was to exchange at varying rates for\r\nthe junior securities above the second series 5s. Everything below the\r\nsecond series 5s was to receive common stock instead. Under the scheme\r\nthe company’s obligations would have been reduced to $60,731,000, of\r\nwhich $33,400,000 prior liens and $24,686,000 new 3 per cents; while\r\nits stock would have been increased to the very considerable figure\r\nof $96,516,282. The total cash assessments, if all paid, would have\r\namounted to $13,506,620; and, joined with the balance of stock, were\r\nexpected to be sufficient to cover the floating debt. The new fixed\r\ncharges were to be $7,064,830.[219]\r\n\r\nVarious points in the plan deserve mention. For the first time since\r\nthe failure of 1880 it was proposed to use two kinds of securities,\r\nof which interest on one should be fixed, and interest on the other\r\noptional. For the retirement of senior bonds President Bond had\r\nsuggested a bond on which half the interest should be fixed and the\r\nother half variable, but his plan had been inferior in flexibility to\r\nthe one now proposed. The junior securities received less favorable\r\ntreatment than before; but the general mortgage itself did not escape,\r\nand was required to accept 3 per cent plus preferred stock instead of\r\na mere funding of its coupons. The increase in the amount of stock was\r\nvery great, and naturally so, in view of the new uses to which it was\r\nput.[220] Assessments were made heavier, and for the first time the\r\nmanagement frankly excluded from their calculations the Central of New\r\nJersey, foreshadowing the abandonment of the lease. To repeat, the\r\nfirst two plans described had developed the idea of an assessment and\r\nthe conversion of the junior bonds into income obligations. To this\r\nthe reorganization trustees added the use of preferred stock, and, more\r\nimportant still, the combination of two securities, respectively with\r\nobligatory and optional liens, which were to be given for the general\r\nmortgage bonds. In principle the result was excellent, in practice the\r\ndegree of reduction was somewhat too slight from the point of view of\r\nthe company, although it seemed more than the creditors were willing\r\nto accept. The general mortgage bondholders in particular were loud in\r\ntheir protest. “The truth of the matter is this,” said one of them,\r\n“while the plan of the trustees has much to commend it, and is based\r\non an excellent theory, it fails to cover the whole ground, and falls\r\nterribly short of meeting our reasonable demands.” Thus, although the\r\nBartol and Whelen committees accepted the plan, matters again stood\r\nstill for a while, while the financial powers talked and wrote and\r\nthreshed the question out.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1886, the reorganization trustees received a letter signed\r\nby J. Pierpont Morgan and John Lowber Welsh, which is important enough\r\nto be quoted in full.\r\n\r\n“A syndicate has been formed,” said these gentlemen, “composed of\r\nleading bankers and capitalists here and in Europe, together with\r\ncorporations or their representatives controlling large transportation\r\nand coal producing interests, who have agreed to subscribe in the\r\naggregate $15,000,000 for the purpose of aiding in the reorganization\r\nof the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad Company and its affiliated\r\nlines. The syndicate has no commitment of any kind with any other\r\nrailroads or corporations upon this subject beyond securing a\r\nmanagement in harmony with the principle that capital invested in\r\ninternal improvements should be so managed as to result in a fair\r\nreturn in the way of interest and dividends. Their object and purpose\r\nis to secure the reorganization on business principles for the\r\nPhiladelphia & Reading bondholders, stockholders, and creditors without\r\nprejudice to the relative position of either, and in their interest\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n“To do this effectually there must be suitable arrangements made\r\nwith the Pennsylvania Railroad and other kindred coal interests for\r\nharmonious relations, in order that suitable prices may be obtained for\r\ncoal produced and shipped. These objects we shall endeavor to secure,\r\nand we now enclose you a copy of a correspondence with Mr. Roberts,\r\npresident of the Pennsylvania Railroad, on these subjects, which seems\r\nto us sufficient to warrant the syndicate in placing reliance upon the\r\nassurance given by that company.\r\n\r\n“As the reorganization shall proceed our effort and expectation will be\r\nto bring about satisfactory arrangements with all the anthracite coal\r\nroads, and also the trunk lines, which shall secure to the Philadelphia\r\n& Reading Railroad Company, when reorganized, its just share of the\r\nbusiness at remunerative rates.\r\n\r\n“The syndicate have believed that your plan was, in the main, suitable\r\nfor the purpose of reorganization, and that your board was composed of\r\ngentlemen who would command the confidence of all parties in interest.\r\n\r\n“They therefore prefer to make an arrangement with you and to aid you\r\nin working out a plan.\r\n\r\n“But they also think that there should be certain modifications as to\r\nyour organization, and also as to your plan, as follows:\r\n\r\n“(1) The syndicate would wish two persons, to be named by them, added\r\nto your board.\r\n\r\n“(2) Your plan should be made so flexible that it could be modified\r\nhereafter in such respects as may be found necessary to success.\r\n\r\n“(3) There should be an executive committee of five to take charge\r\nof the foreclosure proceedings, the purchase of the property, the\r\norganization of the new company, and generally of whatever may properly\r\nappertain to reconstruction under the plan. There should be five voting\r\ntrustees who should vote on the stock when deposited under the plan,\r\nand to whom the power of voting on the stock in the reorganized company\r\nshould be confided for five years after reorganization. These two\r\ncommittees should be composed of parties satisfactory to the syndicate\r\nand the trustees, and shall fill their own vacancies. But in case the\r\nsyndicate and trustees cannot agree upon the five, then, and in that\r\ncase, three shall be named by the syndicate and two by the trustees,\r\nand each class shall fill any vacancy occurring in its own number.\r\n\r\n“(4) The compensation to be allowed to the syndicate shall be 5 per\r\ncent on the amount of the syndicate capital.\r\n\r\n“(5) The syndicate to be allowed interest at the rate of 6 per cent\r\nupon any amount they may advance the company in the course of the\r\nprocess of foreclosure and reorganization.\r\n\r\n“(6) Proper provision must be made for securing to the syndicate the\r\nrefunding of the money they may advance on account of interest not\r\nexceeding 4 per cent per annum on the general mortgage bonds during\r\nreconstruction, and also for the substitution of the syndicate in the\r\nplace of any creditor or stockholder who may abandon his holding and\r\nrefuse to pay his assessment, it being the purpose of the syndicate to\r\npay 4 per cent per annum interest on the general mortgage bonds during\r\nreconstruction, and also to pay the assessments of such parties as may\r\nabandon their holdings or right to take the securities to which they\r\nmay be entitled under the plan.”[221]\r\n\r\nThe correspondence with Mr. Roberts referred to contained the\r\nassurance that the Pennsylvania Company would not hold aloof from\r\nan understanding with the Reading either in respect to the coal or\r\ntransportation business, and would, moreover, “cordially unite in the\r\narbitration of all differences.”[222] This could not, of course, force\r\ndistasteful terms upon the Reading bondholders, but it could and did\r\nsupply sufficient capital to ensure the success of any plan adopted,\r\nand it infused confidence and vigor into the action of the nearly\r\ndiscouraged reorganization trustees. The executive committee which they\r\nwere to name was perhaps a useful tool, but the suggestion of a voting\r\ntrust was a genuine contribution, and aided powerfully in securing\r\nnecessary backing for future schemes.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remarked that the syndicate appeared with no panacea,\r\nwas without a plan of its own, and at first merely adopted that of\r\nthe trustees, with a few modifications which it thought advisable;\r\nbut that by March, 1886, it had so worked over the proposals of the\r\nreorganization trustees as to make in many respects a new plan;\r\nwhich retained the assessments, likewise the combination of fixed\r\nand optional charges and the use of preferred stock, but reserved\r\n4 per cent bonds against prior liens, gave 4 per cent bonds with\r\npreferred stock in exchange for the general mortgage instead of 3 per\r\ncents, and created four classes of stock instead of three. Somewhat\r\nmore in detail this plan was as follows: The Reading was to issue a\r\nnew 4 per cent general mortgage for $100,000,000, and four kinds of\r\nstock: a preferred, income, consolidated, and common. Of the general\r\nmortgage $9,792,000 were to be for future use in the improvement\r\nof the railway; of the remainder $38,422,000 were to be reserved\r\nagainst prior liens; $24,686,000 were to exchange for the general\r\nmortgage if such should not be paid off in cash; $15,000,000 were\r\nto take up shares or bonds of leased lines, and $10,000,000 were to\r\nexchange for or to redeem Coal & Iron Company divisional mortgages.\r\nThe total amount issued was to be $90,208,000, and no mortgage in\r\naddition was to be placed on the Reading properties for five years\r\nafter the reorganization without the consent of a majority of the\r\npreferred stockholders. Of the different classes of new stock the\r\npreferred was to be given dividends up to 5 per cent non-cumulative,\r\nand then the income and consolidated stocks were to have up to 5 per\r\ncent non-cumulative. Generally speaking, the preferred stock was to\r\ngo for assessments; the income stock for the income mortgage and\r\nconvertible adjustment scrip; the consolidated stock for the first\r\nseries 5s and one-quarter of the principal of the second series\r\n5s; the common stock for the rest of the second series 5s, for the\r\nconvertible debentures, deferred income bonds, and for old preferred\r\nand common stock. New fixed charges were estimated at $6,971,687, which\r\ndividends on the preferred stock would raise to $8,198,636. There was\r\nto be a voting trust for five years, consisting of J. Lowber Welsh,\r\nJ. P. Morgan, Henry Lewis, George F. Baer, and Robert H. Sayre; and\r\na syndicate was to advance necessary expenditures and disbursements\r\npending reorganization, including unpaid assessments. The syndicate\r\ncompensation was to be 6 per cent on its advances, plus a commission\r\nof 5 per cent upon its $15,000,000 of subscribed capital. The property\r\nwas to be sold at foreclosure sale, and a new company was to be\r\norganized.[223]\r\n\r\nA comparison of this with the plan of the reorganization trustees at\r\nfirst announced will show the changes made. Nothing of value which\r\nprevious reorganizations had worked out was cast aside. The fixed\r\ninterest allowed the general mortgage bondholders was raised in the\r\nhope that they might support the plan, and more care was taken to\r\nfollow the order of priority in the advantages offered to the various\r\nclasses of junior securityholders; an end to which the four classes\r\nof stock were admirably adapted. The voting trust was altogether new,\r\nand was doubtless intended to ensure a policy in accord with the\r\nsyndicate’s wishes for a series of years, and to prevent a renewal\r\nof the vagaries of Mr. Gowen’s administration. The provision for\r\nforeclosure was to be expected in view of the extreme difficulty of\r\nobtaining the assents of so many conflicting interests; but with a\r\nnet revenue of $12,026,309 (both companies) and fixed charges of\r\n$6,971,687, the task of maintaining the solvency of the companies in\r\nfuture did not seem an impossible one.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to the plan the Lockwood Committee urged that the scheme\r\nwas unjust to certain classes of bonds; that it was cumbersome,\r\nexpensive, conferred power on the trustees which should have been\r\nreserved for the direction of the new company, and that the reserved\r\npowers to change any part of the plan, and the uncertainties connected\r\nwith the settlements under it, involved risks which creditors should\r\nnot accept.[224] The objections were not weighty. If the Lockwood or\r\nany other committee had proved itself able to formulate and carry\r\nthrough a plan, or if the syndicate arrangement had been proposed at\r\nthe very beginning of the receivership, bondholders might fairly have\r\ncriticised its expense. In point of fact numerous attempts to reconcile\r\ndivergent interests had failed, and what with Messrs. Lockwood, Bartol,\r\nWhelen, Gowen, and their respective followings, the future offered no\r\nmore promising result. Meanwhile bondholders were going without their\r\ninterest, and costs of the receivership were mounting up; so that a\r\ngreater expense than that of which Mr. Lockwood complained was being\r\nincurred by delay. As for the general mortgage bondholders, they were\r\ngiven a chance at their old interest whenever the road should earn\r\nit, and could fairly ask no more; while that it was inequitable to\r\nask income bondholders to accept a reduction to $50 in their annual\r\ninterest, or holders of the first series 5s to wait for their interest\r\nuntil liens before theirs had been satisfied, are conclusions to which\r\nfew will agree.\r\n\r\nIn April Messrs. Whelen and William H. Kemble, representing the\r\nReading consolidated mortgage bondholders, announced that they had\r\ndetermined not to accept the syndicate plan. Even before this Mr.\r\nGowen announced that he was organizing a syndicate and would soon be\r\nable to pay off overdue coupons on the general mortgage bonds, and\r\nto prevent any foreclosure under that mortgage.[225] It is scarcely\r\nnecessary to say that he had a plan of his own. He proposed to issue\r\n$100,000,000 4 per cent 70-year consolidated mortgage bonds much as did\r\nthe syndicate, part of which should go to redeem the general mortgage\r\nand the floating debt; but second to this he suggested a cumulative 4\r\nper cent first preferred income bond, to take the place of the income\r\nand consolidated stock under the syndicate plan, and to be exchanged\r\nfor the first series 5s, a portion of the second series 5s, and some\r\nof the leased canal securities; while finally he planned a second\r\npreferred cumulative 4 per cent income bond, to be exchanged for those\r\nsecurities down to the deferred income bonds, which under the syndicate\r\nscheme were to receive common stock. The surplus of income offered by\r\nthe old general mortgage was to be made good by first preference bonds.\r\nThe existing preferred and common stocks were to remain as they were,\r\nand the deferred income obligations were to remain untouched. Finally,\r\nthe New Jersey Central was to be retained in friendly alliance, either\r\nunder a modified lease at a rental equal to earnings, or under a\r\nspecial traffic contract.\r\n\r\nA comparison of this with the syndicate plan shows that Mr. Gowen gave\r\nup the idea of an assessment; provided for the floating debt through\r\nfirst preference bonds; swept away three of the four classes of stock,\r\nreplacing them by two kinds of income bonds; and retained the deferred\r\nincome bonds which the syndicate proposed to retire. His plan was to be\r\ncarried through without foreclosure, but outside of this its advantages\r\nare rather difficult to ascertain. The abandonment of the assessment\r\nwas distinctly bad; the retention of the deferred income issue was also\r\nbad; the reduction in the number of kinds of securities tended towards\r\nsimplicity, but made impossible the nice distinction of priority on\r\nwhich the syndicate had relied; while even the replacement of stock by\r\nincome bonds must be condemned, substituting as it did an obligation\r\nwithout any very distinct character of its own for a stock which\r\nrepresented frankly only a share in the profits of the enterprise.\r\nThese things were realized, and the plan received no serious support;\r\nbut as every plan so far proposed contributed something to the final\r\nproduct, so Mr. Gowen’s income bonds and his aversion to foreclosure\r\nwere not without influence upon the scheme which ultimately attained\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThe next few months saw active hostilities between Mr. Gowen and the\r\nsyndicate; the former taking the position that he would never consent\r\nto foreclosure, nor to the placing of the property for five years under\r\nthe management of a board of trustees named by his adversaries.[226]\r\nTo Mr. Garrett, chairman of the reconstruction trustees, he wrote\r\nsuggesting that the board should substitute his plan for that of the\r\nsyndicate, and that seven reconstruction trustees should be appointed\r\nby the managers of the company to carry it through. “Upon this being\r\ndone,” said he, “I will engage that the plan shall be underwritten by\r\nan association of capital sufficient for the purpose of paying off all\r\nthe general mortgage bonds which do not voluntarily accept the new\r\nsecurities provided by the plan, and I will agree that the financial\r\nresponsibility of these subscribers to this fund shall be determined by\r\nthe presidents of the Bank of North America, the Farmers’ & Mechanics’\r\nNational Bank, the Pennsylvania Company for Insurance of Lives, etc.,\r\nand the Union Trust Company....”[227] Mr. Garrett naturally refused.\r\n\r\nAs in many cases before, the struggle ended in a compromise. The\r\nnew agreement was as follows: The syndicate was to be enlarged by\r\n$4,000,000 additional subscriptions, and the reconstruction trustees\r\nincreased to thirteen by the addition of certain friends of Mr. Gowen,\r\none of whom was also to be given place upon the executive committee.\r\nThe syndicate plan was to be carried through without foreclosure,\r\nproviding sufficient assents could be obtained, and was to be modified\r\nby the substitution of first, second, and third 4 per cent income bonds\r\nfor preferred, income, and consolidated 5 per cent stock. Dividends\r\non the bonds, like those on the stock, were to be payable from net\r\nearnings only; but net earnings were defined as the profits derived\r\nfrom all sources after paying operating expenses, taxes, and existing\r\nrentals, guarantees and interest charges, _but not fixed charges of the\r\nsame sort subsequently created_. All third preference bonds issued for\r\nconvertible bonds were to have the right to be converted into common\r\nstock; and the company was to have the privilege of increasing the\r\nissue, subject for five years to the approval of the voting trustees.\r\nAs finally worked out, the first preference bonds were to be given for\r\nassessments; the second preference for all securities which had been\r\npromised income or consolidated stock; and the third preference for the\r\nsecond series 5s, convertible and debenture bonds, and preferred stock\r\nto which common stock had before been allotted. Somewhat more emphasis\r\nwas laid on the possibility of paying off the general mortgage. It was\r\nproposed to reduce the aggregate of rentals and guarantees (exclusive\r\nof the Central of New Jersey, the Schuylkill Navigation Company,\r\nand the Susquehanna Canal Company) to an annual charge of less than\r\n$2,350,000 by direct negotiation with the companies affected. And to\r\ndeal directly with the three companies above named upon the basis of a\r\ncontinuance of their respective leases at rentals involving no fixed\r\nliability beyond the earning power of the leased line, or on the basis\r\nof a surrender of the said leases, and the cancellation of the traffic\r\nagreement with the Schuylkill Navigation Company for a consideration.\r\nThe voting trust was to be composed of three representatives of the\r\nsyndicate and one friend of Mr. Gowen, which four should elect a\r\nfifth who should be satisfactory both to the syndicate and to the\r\nreconstruction trustees. A united effort was to be made by the company,\r\nthe reconstruction trustees, and the syndicate to secure the immediate\r\nappointment of Mr. Austin Corbin as an additional receiver; and, if Mr.\r\nCorbin would take the position and legally qualify himself to fill it,\r\nit was understood that the presidency of the company would be offered\r\nto him. The other provisions of the syndicate plan were to remain\r\nunchanged.[228]\r\n\r\nThe total capital and charges under the plan were to be as follows:\r\n\r\n                                       _Est’d Capital_  _Fixed Charges_\r\n\r\n  Prior mortgage liens,                  $85,807,920       $4,233,055\r\n  Annual rental of leased lines                             2,350,000\r\n    not to exceed                                          ----------\r\n                                                           $6,583,055\r\n  First preference income mortgage,       24,410,822        1,220,542\r\n                                        ------------       ----------\r\n                                        $110,218,742       $7,803,597\r\n  Second preference income mortgage,      26,140,518        1,307,026\r\n                                        ------------       ----------\r\n                                        $136,359,260       $9,110,623\r\n  Third preference income mortgage,       14,956,016          747,800\r\n                                        ------------       ----------\r\n                                        $151,315,276       $9,858,423\r\n  Common stock,                           38,369,076\r\n  Deferred incomes,                        6,225,327\r\n    $20,751,090 at issue price,         ------------\r\n                                        $195,909,679\r\n\r\nWe have now the reorganization in its final shape, and it will be\r\ninteresting to review briefly the gradual way in which this shape was\r\nfashioned. With the company plunged anew into bankruptcy after a\r\nreorganization insufficient to afford any genuine relief, the proposal\r\nwas made to fund one-half the general mortgage coupons for three years\r\nand to convert all junior claims into liens on income. This scheme\r\nfailed because plainly inadequate to meet the needs of the situation,\r\nand a modified version was presented providing for an assessment with\r\nwhich to pay the floating debt. The assessment was approved, but not\r\nthe plan, and an ensuing scheme supplied an altogether new method\r\nof treatment, whereby on the one hand the assessment was made more\r\nheavy, and on the other two classes of preferred stock were proposed,\r\nwith one issue of bonds at 3 per cent. This plan failed, not so much\r\nbecause of its inadequacy, although it was inadequate, but because\r\ngeneral mortgage bondholders felt that a 3 per cent bond was less than\r\nthey could reasonably expect for their holdings, and insisted on a\r\nsecurity with a higher obligatory rate of interest. The next plan took\r\nnote of these objections: it raised the interest on the bonds which it\r\nproposed from 3 to 4 per cent; and in the endeavor to please the junior\r\nbondholders as well, created four classes of preferred stock, by means\r\nof which the relative priority of different issues was carefully and\r\ncompletely recognized. Assessments were retained, and a guarantee by\r\na syndicate and a voting trust for five years was suggested. In the\r\ndiscussion that followed, a new scheme was introduced, which replaced\r\nthe preferred stock by two classes of income bonds, and forced the\r\nmanagers to realize the desire of the old bondholders for some new\r\nsecurity with at least the name of bond. As a result, the syndicate\r\nwhich had fathered the previous plan consented to substitute for\r\nthree of their classes of stock first, second, and third preference\r\nbonds. Meanwhile the fixed charges estimated for the successive plans\r\nsteadily decreased. The first looked for $12,911,000, or $14,266,051\r\nas variously reckoned; the second for $14,143,384, or, deducting the\r\nJersey Central, for $8,223,177; the third for $7,064,830; the fourth\r\nfor $6,971,687; and the sixth for $6,583,055. Thus each plan took over\r\nwhat was most satisfactory in its predecessor; and there was on the one\r\nhand a steady decrease in the fixed charges proposed, and on the other\r\na continuous effort to discover some plan which might be satisfactory\r\nto all concerned.\r\n\r\nThat the compromise plan last mentioned succeeded was in part due to\r\nthe feeling of all contending parties that concessions must be made;\r\nit was due also to endorsement by the leaders of the more important\r\ninterests; and, finally, to an appreciation that the plan was after\r\nall a good one, reducing largely the fixed charges which the company\r\nwould have to pay, while depriving no one of a return which, under the\r\ncircumstances, he could fairly expect to receive. Mr. Corbin proved\r\nwilling to undertake the new responsibilities put upon him. He was\r\ntherefore appointed receiver in October, and elected president in the\r\nJanuary following.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it would be a mistake to suppose that the plan was\r\nunanimously accepted from the start. The Lockwood Committee of general\r\nmortgage bondholders were prompt in their disapproval, pronouncing it\r\n“unjust, uncertain, and indefinite”; saying that reorganization under\r\nit would be unduly expensive, and that it was more objectionable than\r\nthe plans which had preceded it.[229] Equally decided was a small\r\ngroup of capitalists which held a majority of the first series 5s\r\noutstanding, the members of which were said to have agreed to hold\r\ntheir bonds and to abide the result.[230] The original time limit for\r\ndeposits expired on March 1, 1887; it was then extended to March 15,\r\nand again to March 31, and deposits of $110,409,464 out of a total of\r\n$117,972,859 were secured. By October certain other bondholders had\r\nbeen induced to come in, and the trustees declared the plan operative.\r\nHolders of $3,348,000 of first series 5s stayed out, and forced an\r\narrangement by which they were practically paid off in cash.[231]\r\nArrangements were made with some of the subsidiary Reading lines, but\r\nthe lease of the Central of New Jersey was not renewed. Only odds\r\nand ends now remained to be cleared up, and all through the rest of\r\nthe year the managers were busy paying off receivers’ certificates,\r\nfloating debt, overdue interest, etc. On January 1, 1888, without\r\nformalities, the Reading passed out of receivers’ hands and into the\r\ncontrol of the stockholders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA & READING\r\n\r\n  Difficulties of the Coal & Iron Company—McLeod’s policy of extension\r\n    —Collapse of this policy—Failure of company—Summary of\r\n    subsequent history.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the year 1888 a new period in the history of the Reading began.\r\nThe long struggle to bring the company back to solvency was fairly\r\nover, and for the first time in seven years the road saw before it a\r\nchance for genuine prosperity. Unlike the reorganization of 1880–3,\r\nthat of 1884–7 succeeded in accomplishing the greater part of the\r\nsaving expected of it. According to the plan, interest charges were\r\nto be reduced to $4,233,055;—in 1888 they were $4,516,433, and in\r\n1889 $4,058,139; rentals were not to exceed $2,350,000;—in 1888\r\nthey were $2,882,582, and in 1889 $2,842,319. Other payments, it is\r\ntrue, the necessity for which was passed over by the advocates of the\r\nplan, raised the total which the road was obliged to meet, but did\r\nnot prevent a comfortable balance of over $2,000,000 for the Railroad\r\nCompany in 1888, and one of $1,444,000 for both Railroad and Coal\r\nCompanies combined. During the next few years large sums were spent in\r\nimproving the permanent way. By January, 1889, almost the entire line\r\nbetween New York and Philadelphia had been relaid with 85 and 90 pound\r\nrails; grades had been smoothed, bridges strengthened, and culverts\r\nstrengthened or rebuilt.\r\n\r\nLess satisfactory than the results for the Railroad Company, however,\r\nwere those for the Coal & Iron Company. In this case profits of\r\n$654,211 for 1887 turned into a loss of $806,222 for 1888, and in the\r\nfollowing year a weak demand for coal, combined with a high cost of\r\nmining, increased the loss to $974,373. President Corbin felt called\r\nupon to explain that prior to 1886 the deficits of the Coal Company\r\nhad been habitually met by inflating the capital account of the\r\nRailroad Company; so that with allowance for this fact the showing of\r\nthe companies under his management had been relatively good.[232] In\r\nNovember, 1889, a letter of Mr. Gowen’s was issued, hopeful as ever,\r\ncriticising the management for their refusal or neglect to give\r\nauthoritative information about actual earnings, but pointing to the\r\nlarge expense for new coal cars, barges, and collieries, and explaining\r\nthe benefit which these would confer.[233]\r\n\r\nThe weakened position of its allied company pulled the Reading\r\ndown, and prevented it from attaining the secure position which had\r\nseemed in sight. The payment of dividends only increased the general\r\ndissatisfaction. In February, 1889, holders of a considerable amount\r\nof second preference bonds circulated a petition objecting to the\r\nofficial statement of net earnings applicable to these securities, and\r\ndemanded an examination of the books. After an investigation their\r\nexpert declared that a 7½ per cent dividend had been earned, but the\r\nbondholders could not induce the company to increase its distribution.\r\nThe next year preference bondholders fared even worse. The managers\r\ndeclared that the surplus over all fixed charges for the year was\r\nbarely $100,000, and that no dividends at all upon their holdings\r\ncould be paid. Again an investigation was demanded and accorded,\r\nand Mr. Howard Lewis, the expert appointed, reported that there was\r\napplicable to the payment of interest upon first preference bonds the\r\nsum of $90,101, or ⅜ of one per cent; a sum which the company promptly\r\nagreed to pay. Meanwhile even the stockholders were becoming restless.\r\nIn June, 1889, a suit was commenced in Philadelphia, praying that the\r\ncompany’s voting trustees and the trust under which they acted should\r\nbe set aside, on the ground that the trust was to be exercised by five\r\nvoting trustees, whereas only four had ever been appointed. Later on\r\nthe matter was taken up by London stockholders, and became serious\r\nenough to force a concession of two seats in the board of managers of\r\nthe company.\r\n\r\nThere was no question but that the trouble was caused by depression in\r\nthe anthracite coal business, for in the carriage of both passengers\r\nand freight the Reading in these years made steady and substantial\r\ngains. In the three years following 1887 the number of passengers\r\ntransported increased by 2,400,000 and the earnings from them by\r\n$470,000; while the freight tons moved gained 1,500,000 and the freight\r\nearnings $1,000,000. Only in coal was there a decrease, which appeared\r\nfor the Coal & Iron Company in the figures for sales and gross and net\r\nreceipts, and for the Railroad Company in the earnings from anthracite\r\ntransported. The result was an attempt to improve the situation:\r\nfirst, by a combination among coal producing roads which should raise\r\nthe selling price of that commodity; and second, by extension of the\r\nrailroad into new markets, whereby an outlet for increased production\r\nshould be obtained. At the instigation of Mr. Gowen a syndicate was\r\nformed to purchase a majority of the stock of the Reading Company,[234]\r\nwhich bought much more than 50 per cent, even though Mr. Gowen, the\r\nprime mover, died in the mean time. The existing managers showed no\r\ndesire to combat the movement, although the voting power lay entirely\r\nin their hands. In June, 1890, President Corbin resigned, and Mr. A. A.\r\nMcLeod was elected in his place.\r\n\r\nMr. McLeod now began a vigorous policy of consolidation and expansion\r\nwith the lease for the second time of the Central of New Jersey. He\r\nevaded a New Jersey law which forbade the lease of a domestic to\r\na foreign corporation by incorporating the Port Reading Railroad\r\nCompany and then executing a lease of the Central to this minor\r\ncorporation.[235] The Port Reading promised 7 per cent on the Central\r\nstock for 999 years, plus one-half the surplus earnings above the\r\ndividend up to 10 per cent, and secured a guarantee of the fulfilment\r\nof these promises from the Reading Railroad proper. Finally, Mr. McLeod\r\nleased the Lehigh Valley to the Reading direct, on a guarantee of 5\r\nper cent on the stock until May 31, 1892; 6 per cent from that time\r\nuntil November 30, and 7 per cent thereafter for the rest of the 999\r\nyears. So far as control over the coal supply was concerned this put\r\nthe Reading in a very favorable position. The Lehigh Valley tapped\r\nthe northern Wyoming field, and the Central of New Jersey the Mahanoy\r\nand Shamokin deposits, and both had access to New York through New\r\nJersey. The Lehigh, moreover, extended to Buffalo; and with a line of\r\nsteamers to Duluth, Milwaukee, and Chicago, promised to command a large\r\nproportion of east-bound traffic in other things than coal. Figures\r\nfor the coal industry show that the Reading, Central, and Lehigh\r\nshipped in 1891 53.3 per cent of the total production of 40,448,000\r\ntons; in 1890 55.5 per cent; and in 1889 57.75 per cent. In addition,\r\ncontrol of the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western was said to have been\r\nacquired by the purchase of a majority of its stock, which added 15.1\r\npercent more;[236] making a total of 68.4 percent for the year 1891,\r\nor sufficient to give a considerable measure of control over prices.\r\nBut the terms were severe; quite as severe as in the case of the leases\r\nearlier put through; and though the Reading was in better shape than it\r\nhad been five years before, full interest on its preference bonds was\r\nnot being paid, and so long as this continued no outside payments could\r\nproperly be made. The subsidiary companies, on the other hand, were\r\nnot earning the dividends promised on their stock by nearly one-third\r\nof a million dollars; and it seemed unlikely that sufficient economies\r\ncould be secured to cover permanently the deficit. The question could\r\nfairly have been asked whether the Reading had not bought a chance\r\nto contribute an annual sum to the Lehigh Valley and Jersey Central\r\nstockholders; and whether these roads had not deliberately entered into\r\na contract which was little likely to be carried out. The justification\r\nof the arrangement lay in the control of coal prices which it made\r\npossible, and in the advantages of close traffic arrangements and\r\nconnection with both Philadelphia and New York. “The main reason why\r\nthe combination failed,” said Mr. I. L. Rice before the Industrial\r\nCommission, “was that there was not an understanding of the first\r\nprinciples of an operation of that kind, _i. e._ that it must reduce\r\nprices and not increase them. The anthracite coal combination was\r\nkilled because prices were immediately put up....\r\n\r\n“Q. Mr. McLeod has testified before this commission that it was his\r\nintention to effect such economies as should be reflected in lower\r\nprices. Do we understand that you criticise the policy in that it did\r\nnot so reduce the prices?\r\n\r\n“A. He did not do it, no matter what his intention was.”[237]\r\n\r\nThe situation was, however, as clearly understood by the public as by\r\nthe managers themselves. Even before the combination had begun to carry\r\nout its policy, outcry was made, and as prices went up the agitation\r\nbecame intense. In New Jersey an act to legalize the combination\r\nwhich passed both houses was vetoed by Governor Abbot on the ground\r\nof the effect upon the price of anthracite coal;[238] and in June the\r\nAttorney-General applied for an injunction to dissolve the lease of\r\nthe New Jersey Central to the Philadelphia & Reading, alleging that\r\nthe tripartite agreement between these companies and the Philadelphia\r\n& Reading was illegal. The court granted a temporary injunction,[239]\r\nwhich it continued in August to a final hearing, with conditions to\r\nmake it more effective.\r\n\r\nPrices did not go down, and in October Attorney-General Stockton of\r\nNew Jersey again appeared before Chancellor McGill. He now charged the\r\nPhiladelphia & Reading, the Central, and the Port Reading with having\r\nconspired to advance the price of coal in defiance of the order of\r\nthe court, and asked for the appointment of a receiver to enforce the\r\nformer decree, and to restrain the company from further using the New\r\nJersey railroads for carrying any coal until the advanced price should\r\nhave been reduced.[240] The officers denied the allegations, but the\r\nChancellor sustained the Attorney-General on every point; and only\r\nthe official announcement of the abrogation of the lease prevented\r\nthe granting of the order.[241] The lease of the Lehigh Valley fared\r\nbetter. In a suit brought by M. H. Arnot, a stockholder in the Lehigh\r\nValley, Judge Metzger of the Court of Common Pleas held that the\r\nReading and Lehigh Valley were not parallel and competing lines in the\r\nsense contemplated by the law; and that mere incidental competition\r\nbetween branches or spurs of two systems would not prevent the\r\nconsolidation of their main lines.[242] So much then of the original\r\nprogramme was allowed to stand.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the search for new markets, the Reading had stretched\r\ninto New England, having chosen that territory in the hope of\r\nincreasing its tonnage without a desperate struggle with its\r\nneighbors.[243] The most available subject for control was the Boston\r\n& Maine, which reached from Northampton and Boston, Massachusetts, to\r\nPortland, Maine, was independent of the large trunk lines, and had a\r\nprofitable local business of its own. Purchases of this railroad’s\r\nstock were quietly made; and in October, 1892, the public was surprised\r\nby the election of Mr. McLeod to the presidency, although, as it\r\nsubsequently transpired, an actual majority of Boston & Maine stock was\r\nnot secured.[244] It was obvious that nothing could be gained from\r\nthe new arrangement unless the gap between the Reading and the Boston\r\n& Maine should be filled; and so, even before the purchase of stock in\r\nthe latter was begun, the lease of the Poughkeepsie Bridge across the\r\nHudson was put through,[245] and a controlling interest was bought in\r\nthe stock of the Central, New England & Western. The last-named road\r\nextended from Hartford, Connecticut across the Poughkeepsie Bridge\r\nto Campbell Hall, 145½ miles, and connected at this point with the\r\nPennsylvania, Poughkeepsie & Boston, a road controlled in the interest\r\nof the Reading. This completed a through route from Philadelphia to\r\nHartford. Later the Central, New England & Western Railroad Company and\r\nthe Poughkeepsie Bridge Railroad Company were consolidated into the\r\nPhiladelphia, Reading & New England, with Mr. McLeod as president;[246]\r\nand a controlling interest was purchased in the New York & New England\r\nRailroad, which ran from Poughkeepsie via Hartford and Providence\r\nto Boston,[247] and afforded another entrance into New England. All\r\nthis involved a very great extension of the Reading system. The lease\r\nof the Lehigh Valley had connected it with Buffalo; the subsequent\r\nconsolidations brought it into every New England state, and gave it a\r\ntotal mileage of, roughly, 5000 miles.\r\n\r\nDanger lay in two directions. First, it was possible that even the\r\nunion of the Lehigh, Jersey Central, and the Reading might fail to\r\nsecure a profit for the mining end of the business, and second, the\r\nfinancing of the New England deals might be so conducted as to put the\r\nparent road into a very difficult situation.\r\n\r\nBoth these contingencies occurred. The early termination of the Jersey\r\nCentral lease weakened the control of the Reading over prices, while\r\nthe severity of the winter of 1893, though assisting to maintain\r\nprices, so increased the expense of operating the mines that earnings\r\nfell below fixed charges for the three months ending February 28,\r\n1893, by the amounts of $933,443 for the Railroad Company and $468,362\r\nfor the Coal & Iron Company. Moreover, losses of $616,351 accrued\r\nduring the same time under the Lehigh Valley lease, and were met by\r\nthe Reading, contrary to expectation, and contrary to the express\r\nprovisions of the mortgage by which its income bonds were secured. In\r\norder to accomplish the New England extensions shares were bought on\r\nmargin by President McLeod personally with collateral in part supplied\r\nby himself, in part taken from the treasury of the company, and\r\nconsisting of general mortgage, collateral trust, and income bonds. “On\r\nor about September 22,” said Mr. I. L. Rice, a representative of the\r\nbondholders, who had been examining the books, “Mr. McLeod entered into\r\ncertain individual stock transactions which resulted in the purchase\r\nof 24,036 shares of the stock of the Boston & Maine Railroad Company\r\nand 32,000 shares of the stock of the New York & New England Railroad\r\nCompany. On October 15, 1892, he withdrew from the control of the\r\ncompany, without having previously obtained the authority of the board\r\nof managers therefor, and without expressing the purpose for which he\r\nintended to use the securities, 30,000 general mortgage bonds of the\r\ncompany, which as afterwards appeared were used at that time as margins\r\nin the transaction. He subsequently withdrew from the control of the\r\ncompany in the same manner and for the same purpose, between October 28\r\nand December 1, 1892, $713,000 of collateral trust bonds, and $99,000\r\nthird preference bonds. No reference whatever is made to these stock\r\ntransactions on the books of the company except the mention of the\r\nwithdrawal of securities against the personal receipt of the president,\r\nnor are they referred to on the minutes of the board of managers prior\r\nto December 24, 1892. On the latter date the board of managers in a\r\nresolution approved the transaction, calling for the use of $613,000 of\r\nthe company’s collateral, and indemnifying Mr. McLeod for advances made\r\nfor the same purpose to the extent of $400,000. On January 17, 1893,\r\nMr. McLeod deposited $250,000 additional collateral trust bonds as\r\nmargin, making a total of $963,000. On February 15 Mr. McLeod directed\r\nthat the account be transferred from his individual name to that of the\r\ncompany’s.”[248]\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the matter of the propriety of Mr. McLeod’s action, it\r\nis plain that the method which he employed was an extremely expensive\r\none, in that it raised the necessary cash by temporary loans at high\r\nrates from brokers in New York and Philadelphia instead of by the sale\r\nof stocks or bonds, or by the use of funds which the company might\r\nhave had on hand. According to President Harris, the average charges\r\npaid on the floating debt in 1892, a large portion of which had been\r\naccumulated in these operations, was 9 per cent. If the control over\r\nthe corporations acquired had been desired for temporary reasons the\r\noperation would have been a stock speculation pure and simple, and\r\nthe Reading would have trusted to the possible rise in price of the\r\nsecurities purchased to cancel the expense of advances to the brokers\r\nwho did the buying; but in this case the control was designed to be\r\npermanent, not temporary, and Mr. McLeod expected results which could\r\nbe obtained only after a series of years.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the beginning of 1893. Mr. McLeod had succeeded\r\nin carrying out his plans for a combination of coal producing roads\r\nand for the extension of the Reading into New England, but had seen\r\nhis first project bitterly attacked, and his second scheme become a\r\nburden because of the insufficient funds behind it. Matters came to a\r\nhead in February with an attempt to borrow on $10,000,000 collateral\r\ntrust bonds. Speyer & Co. accepted the issue, but the Drexels refused\r\nto handle it, and began to sell the company’s securities at any\r\nprice.[249] Quotations dropped from 46¾ to 40⅝ on February 17, and\r\ncontinued to fall the two succeeding days, reaching 28 on February 20.\r\nOn this last day application was made to the United States Circuit\r\nCourt in Philadelphia, and Messrs. McLeod, Wilbur, and Paxon were\r\nappointed receivers. “I am very sorry,” said President McLeod, “that we\r\nwere driven to the necessity for a receivership, but it was the only\r\nthing to do. Our credit was attacked in a way which made it impossible\r\nfor us to meet our obligations, and we had the receivership established\r\nbefore the property was further injured.... The trouble was brought\r\nabout by the fact that we were doing an enormous business on a small\r\ncapital, and when this attack was made ... it hurt our credit so that\r\nwe could not borrow money.”[250] Lack of capital was the repeated cry\r\nof the management. At a later date Mr. McLeod again said, “When I\r\nleased the Lehigh Valley and the Jersey Central and took over their\r\ncoal operations ... I found that I had $13,000,000 invested in coal and\r\nin carrying the customers of the companies. The Reading did not have\r\nthat much capital, and I had to borrow $8,000,000 of that $13,000,000.\r\nThen the panic of 1893 came on. I had arranged to fund that $8,000,000\r\nof floating debt by selling securities, etc., giving me a working\r\ncapital of $17,500,000, but the parties who were to furnish the money\r\nhad six months in which to do it, and on account of that panic coming\r\non before I could get the money, there was nothing in the world for me\r\nto do except to put the Reading in the hands of the receivers to save\r\nits securities.”[251] The statements concerning the lack of capital\r\nwere a true explanation though not an excuse. Money had been tied up\r\nin unsalable coal, acquired not only by the leases of the Lehigh and\r\nCentral, but also by purchases from independent operators[252] and by\r\nproduction during the current year;[253] while whatever spare funds\r\nthe Reading had been able to provide had been put into New England\r\nsecurities at high prices to carry out the road’s ambitious plans. In\r\nthe mean time the large purchases on margin made a fall in the price of\r\nReading securities of especial moment; and, as Mr. McLeod explained, it\r\nproved impossible to liquidate the floating debt. The failure of 1893,\r\nthen, was caused less by a continued inability to meet fixed charges\r\nthan by an undue expansion of operations such as has ruined many a\r\nsolvent firm. Reading’s venture in the coal fields had not proved a\r\nsuccess, but the loss had not been sufficient to ruin it within a year;\r\nits New England extensions had not brought all the results desired,\r\nbut they had not had a fair trial; the true cause for the failure was\r\nthe attempt to accomplish by means of stock speculation and temporary\r\nloans at high rates more than the road could do out of its legitimate\r\nresources, with the intent on the one hand to raise the price of coal\r\nand on the other to secure fresh markets for the sale thereof.\r\n\r\nAfter the failure the first impulse of the bondholders was to denounce\r\nMr. McLeod. A meeting of European creditors in London chose a committee\r\nto represent them and solicited McLeod’s removal from the receivership\r\non the “serious ground” that the administration of their property\r\nshould not any longer be jeopardized by remaining under the control of\r\nan official who had already brought it into its existing difficulties.\r\nA New York general mortgage bondholders’ committee decided to act in\r\na similar direction, and Mr. Drexel represented to the president that\r\nhe should resign for the sake of the future of the company.[254] Mr.\r\nMcLeod unwillingly gave way. For successor the board of managers chose\r\nMr. Joseph S. Harris, a man of long experience in railroad affairs. Mr.\r\nHarris had been for many years connected with the Lehigh Valley system,\r\nand was the same man who, it will be remembered, had evaluated the\r\nReading coal properties in 1880. Following his election as president he\r\nwas appointed receiver in the place of Mr. McLeod.\r\n\r\nThe receivers’ statement came out in March and announced a floating\r\ndebt of $18,472,828, against which were held reported assets to the\r\namount of $15,779,784; but of these last $4,985,276 were in the shape\r\nof coal, and $8,861,065 consisted of the items “due for freight,”\r\n“tolls due from connecting roads,” “bills receivable,” “cash,” etc.,\r\na large part of which was probably of little worth. Both the current\r\nliabilities and the current assets are instructive, and show that on\r\nthe one hand Mr. McLeod’s stock operations had involved the company in\r\nheavy obligations to his brokers, and that on the other losses in the\r\ncoal business had necessitated current advances to branch lines from\r\nwhich it was impossible to get return. It appears, for instance, that\r\nthe Coal & Iron Company had been unable to pay the sums charged it for\r\nfreight, and while the full amounts had been nevertheless included\r\nin reported earnings, the actual result had been a swelling of bills\r\nreceivable by debts which the Railroad Company was quite unable to\r\ncollect.[255]\r\n\r\nThe general lines of the policy to be pursued were now sufficiently\r\nclear; the more pressing claims were to be met by the issue of\r\nreceivers’ certificates, expenses were to be cut down, payments under\r\nleases were to be amicably reduced where possible, holdings of Boston\r\n& Maine stock were to be sold, and on the side of the bondholders the\r\nvarious interests were to agree on some scheme for raising cash and for\r\nimproving the general condition of the property. There was need for\r\nsome reduction of fixed charges, but not for such radical cuts as in\r\n1880 or in 1884.\r\n\r\nThe receivers and managers carried out their part of the work first.\r\nApplication was made in March, and again in June, for permission to\r\nissue certificates in settlement of the most urgent claims. In May\r\nMr. McLeod resigned the presidency of the Boston & Maine after a\r\nlarge part of the Reading’s holdings had been sold, and the same month\r\nPresident Harris inaugurated a policy of retrenchment by the retirement\r\nof four out of the five vice-presidents which the Reading had been\r\naccustomed to maintain. In July the receivers obtained permission to\r\ndissolve the agreement with the Pennsylvania, Poughkeepsie & Boston\r\nRailroad, and in August the appointment of a separate receiver for\r\nthe Philadelphia, Reading & New England marked, except for the minor\r\nmatter of the Poughkeepsie Bridge, the final abandonment of New England\r\nextension. Meanwhile an arrangement had been made with the Lehigh\r\nValley, whereby the payments under the lease were reduced for two years\r\nfrom 7 per cent to 5 per cent, on condition that the Reading should\r\nmake extra payments at the end of that time if the Lehigh proved to\r\nhave earned more than 10 per cent in the interval; and permission\r\nhad been obtained from the Circuit Court to surrender the possession\r\nand operation of the Eastern & Amboy Railroad and the Lehigh Valley\r\nTerminal Railroad, both lines belonging to the Lehigh Valley in the\r\nstate of New Jersey. The Lehigh lease, even as modified, aroused much\r\nopposition from bondholders, who rightly maintained that payments\r\nunder it constituted a diversion of funds which should have gone to\r\nthe creditors of the Reading proper. Suit was begun before the Circuit\r\nCourt, and on August 8, 1893, a formal abrogation was obtained. This\r\nincidentally caused the resignation of Mr. Wilbur, president of the\r\nLehigh Valley, from his position as receiver of the Reading, and the\r\nappointment of Mr. J. Lowber Welsh in his place.\r\n\r\nThe more complicated task of the bondholders was at first undertaken\r\nby two committees: one for the general mortgage bondholders, of which\r\nMr. J. Edward Simmons was chairman; and one for the income bondholders,\r\nled by Mr. George Coppell. Three demands were at once made: first, that\r\nMr. McLeod retire from the receivership; second, that the lease of the\r\nLehigh Valley be abrogated; and third, that the books of the company\r\nbe examined by a railroad accountant. The first and second points were\r\ncomplied with, though not altogether because of the insistence of the\r\ncommittees, and in the end the third was also granted, and Mr. Stephen\r\nLittle was set to work.[256]\r\n\r\nOn May 27, 1893, the managers of the company brought forward a\r\nreorganization plan, which estimated the floating debt at $19,991,941,\r\nand proposed to cover it by the issue of $22,000,000 collateral trust\r\nbonds at 95. These bonds were to be redeemable any time before maturity\r\nat 110, and the trustee was authorized “to apply the surplus income or\r\nthe proceeds of sales ... of any of the securities pledged until 1898,\r\nand thereafter so much as might be determined from time to time by the\r\nRailroad Company, to the purchase of the said bonds at the best price\r\nobtainable, or, if necessary, to draw the same for redemption.” General\r\nmortgage and first, second, and third preference bonds were to be\r\nentitled to subscribe to the amount of 10 per cent of their holdings;\r\ndeferred income bonds to 4 per cent; and stockholders to 24 per cent;\r\nwhile besides the $22,000,000 mentioned, $2,000,000 additional bonds\r\nwere to be issued each year for working capital and for the acquisition\r\nof real and personal property. General mortgage bondholders were to\r\nfund their coupons to and including January 1, 1898, and to receive an\r\nequivalent amount of coupon trust certificates. The rental under the\r\nLehigh Valley lease was to be reduced, and the Reading stock was to be\r\ntransferred for seven years to a voting trust composed of Joseph S.\r\nHarris, E. P. Wilbur, Thomas McKean, and two others to be afterwards\r\nnamed.[257] Assents of 90 per cent of the general mortgage bondholders\r\nand of 60 per cent of the stockholders were required by the 21st of\r\nJune to make the plan effective, and a syndicate was pledged to carry\r\nout the provisions if such assents should be obtained.[258]\r\n\r\nAn issue of collateral bonds, a reduction in the Lehigh rental, a\r\nfunding of coupons, and a voting trust: these were the propositions\r\nwhich President Harris and his associates presented for the\r\nconsideration of the bondholders. There was to be no disturbance of\r\nexisting securities, no assessment, not even a reduction of fixed\r\ncharges except as these were lightened by the lowering of rentals and\r\nby the payment of the floating debt. It is to be presumed that the\r\nattempt to extend the Reading into New England was not to be continued,\r\nfor no provision was made for the purchase of the shares of the New\r\nEngland roads hitherto held on margin, and in fact large sales of\r\nBoston & Maine stock had already taken place; but no formal mention of\r\nthe deal was made. The lease of the Lehigh Valley was to be continued\r\nin the hope of better times, while the reduction of rental which the\r\nplan required had already taken place. Under ordinary circumstances\r\nany plan such as the one outlined would have been quite futile. Where\r\nthe failure of a road is due to deep-seated causes the remedy must be\r\nfundamental; and when a piling up of indebtedness is due to inability\r\nto pay fixed charges the situation must be met by a reduction of those\r\ncharges even though a foreclosure sale be a necessary preliminary.\r\nIn the present case matters were somewhat different: bankruptcy had\r\ncome, not from a long-continued drain, but from a rapid diffusion of\r\nresources in an attempt to accomplish more than the finances of the\r\nroad would permit; and a change of policy was the thing most urgently\r\nrequired. But this again was not a question with which a reorganization\r\nplan had to deal, except in so far as such a plan might smooth the\r\ndifficulties which lay in the way; and any scheme which should restore\r\nto the company the collateral imperilled in its rash campaign, fund the\r\nfloating debt at a reasonable rate of interest, and give the management\r\na chance to start again, was worthy of serious consideration. It may\r\nbe observed, however, that granting all of the above, the plan before\r\nus did not go far enough. The extensions due to President McLeod had\r\nbeen in the heart of the coal regions, as well as in New England, and\r\none of the most important of these, the Lehigh Valley, the managers\r\nproposed to retain. This policy, it may be said, was of very doubtful\r\nwisdom. The attempt to monopolize the production of anthracite coal had\r\nalready been fruitful of disaster, and the possession of the Lehigh\r\nwould have constituted a continual temptation to future purchases;\r\nwhile it was far from certain that even under the reduced rental the\r\nroad could have been made to pay. What the Reading needed was a period\r\nof quiet attention to its own business, undisturbed by meddling in the\r\nbusiness of other people; an attention which would be sure to result in\r\nincreased economies, and was the true remedy for the lack of prosperity\r\nin the coal industry which had driven Mr. McLeod on his wild career. It\r\nis to this latter judgment that we must in the end conform. The plan\r\nof President Harris was not so inadequate as might at first appear;\r\nit accomplished much that needed to be accomplished, and it gave an\r\nopportunity to the management of the road to retrace many of the steps\r\nof the previous two years; but on the other hand, it did not embrace\r\nthe chance to free the Reading from all its mistaken enterprises, and\r\npassed by an occasion which could only again occur after much suffering\r\nand loss.\r\n\r\nDiscussion turned, however, on other features. In a circular to\r\nsecurityholders in June, President Harris said: “My deliberate opinion\r\nis that the assistance asked for by the proposed plan ... is none too\r\ngreat, and that there is a good probability that if it is afforded and\r\nthe plan is carried out prudent and careful management may prevent the\r\nrecurrence of such a crisis. My judgment is that the securityholders\r\nwill make a very serious mistake if they do not accept the relief\r\noffered them, for I see no probability that the necessary assistance\r\ncan hereafter be obtained except upon much more onerous terms. I\r\nstrongly advise that the plan shall be promptly accepted.”[259] “We\r\ncannot but regard these terms as very easy,” said the _Financial\r\nChronicle_. “To be sure a new collateral trust mortgage for\r\n$30,000,000, bearing 6 per cent, is to be created, but the greater part\r\nof this goes to take up floating debt and other existing obligations,\r\nand will involve no increase in fixed charges....”[260] On the other\r\nhand, it was objected that the plan was formed entirely in the interest\r\nof the floating debt holders, income bondholders, and stockholders;\r\nand that the management under the arrangement would have the power\r\nto pay dividends upon the income bonds, while at the same time the\r\ncoupons on the 4 per cent mortgage bonds were being funded.[261] In an\r\neditorial urging foreclosure proceedings the London _Standard_ said:\r\n“That [foreclosure] will prevent holders of pledged collaterals from\r\ngetting a market for their securities, and, at the same time, bring a\r\ngood many doubtful matters connected with the finances of the company\r\ninto the light of day. It should also tend to make the ‘floating debt’\r\nswindle less popular with eminent American financiers. At present they\r\npile these debts up in the full assurance that they can easily arrange\r\nmatters so as to put them, when funded, before existing mortgages. It\r\nis for the Reading general mortgage bondholders to act promptly for\r\ntheir own interests.”[262] Finally, it was objected that the plan was\r\nin the interest of the McLeod management, and that the voting trust\r\nwas to be a McLeod organization, which would either whitewash the\r\nex-president’s operations, or by keeping them in the background would\r\nvirtually outlaw them.\r\n\r\nThe plan failed because the time allowed for deposits was too short.\r\nIn spite of the objections raised 31,356 general mortgage bonds and\r\n411,218 shares of stock were deposited in twenty-five days, and it\r\nwas maintained that additional securities would surely be obtained to\r\nmake up the percentages required. The managers alleged, however, that\r\nextension was impracticable, and announced that the scheme could not go\r\nthrough.[263]\r\n\r\nThe year following this attempt at rehabilitation was full of the\r\nstruggles of different interests, each jealous of any concession and\r\nworking devotedly for its own hand. Prominent at this time was Mr.\r\nI. L. Rice, the same gentleman who has before been quoted in connection\r\nwith Mr. McLeod’s operations in New England stocks. Mr. Rice had\r\nbeen a member of the syndicate which had put Mr. McLeod into the\r\npresidency, and had served as foreign representative of the company\r\nduring his régime. He had been instrumental in forming the anthracite\r\ncoal combination, and at the time of the Reading failure had been in\r\nEngland raising money to finance the coal holdings then acquired.[264]\r\nReturning from Europe upon the appointment of receivers, he examined\r\nthe Reading books with the results which have been noticed, and now\r\nappeared as the active enemy of everything connected with Mr. McLeod,\r\neven to the receivers who had succeeded him. In May, 1893, he resigned\r\nthe seat which he had held on the Reading board, on the ground that\r\nthe management had condoned the use by Mr. McLeod of the company’s\r\nsecurities in carrying on his private and personal speculations;\r\nin September he resigned from the income bondholders’ committee,\r\nand attacked in a circular the McLeod régime and the succeeding\r\nreceivership;[265] and in December he applied for the removal of the\r\nreceivers, alleging that they had grossly neglected their duties to the\r\nstockholders, and had ignored the financial transactions of Mr. McLeod\r\nprior to their appointment.[266]\r\n\r\nIn spite of his hostility to the existing régime, Mr. Rice hoped\r\nto rehabilitate the company without foreclosure or, indeed, formal\r\nreorganization. The action of others was inspired by a less optimistic\r\nview. The original suit on which receivers had been appointed had been\r\nbrought by one Thomas C. Platt; but as early as March Alfred Sully and\r\nA. B. Rand of New York, and John Lowrie of London, holders of first\r\nand second preference income bonds, petitioned to intervene. In July\r\nJudge Dallas dismissed the Lowrie suit, but the petition was renewed in\r\nSeptember, alleging that Mr. Platt “did not file his bill in good faith\r\non his own behalf, and on behalf of all other holders of bonds, but\r\nat the request and for the benefit and protection of the men who were\r\nthen managers of the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad Company and the\r\nPhiladelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company, and that the suit was not\r\nbeing pressed with due diligence.”[267]\r\n\r\nAll this time the receivers had been busy on a plan, which they\r\npresented in January, 1894. By leaving out of consideration some\r\n$5,000,000 of car trusts they arrived at the figure of $12,500,000\r\nfor the floating debt. This they proposed to cover by the issue of\r\n$6,000,000 in 6 per cent ten-year trust certificates, based on the\r\nstock of coal on hand, and by $10,000,000 in 5 per cent collateral\r\ntrust bonds then in the treasury of the Reading Company. They hoped\r\nthat a balance of $2,500,000 would then remain available for working\r\ncapital or other purposes. General mortgage coupons were to be funded\r\nfor five years, although the receivers planned to have a syndicate\r\nformed to purchase at par for cash the coupons as they matured, giving\r\nto the bondholders in each case the choice between receiving money or\r\ncoupon trust certificates for the interest due. There was to be no\r\nformal reorganization, no cuts in charges, nothing but a provision for\r\nthe floating debt and for a temporary funding of interest payments;\r\nand this was the more feasible because the Lehigh Valley lease had\r\nbeen by this time abrogated and the New England extensions definitely\r\nabandoned.[268] It will be remembered that to the plan of May, 1893,\r\nit had been objected that the provisions contrived to bring in the\r\nfloating debt ahead of previously existing liens, and were a premium\r\non a kind of financial juggling too common among American railroads.\r\nThis plan, therefore, avoided a new issue of bonds, and used only\r\nwhat the treasury already possessed. The coal notes were obviously\r\nunobjectionable, and served at the same time to utilize the unsalable\r\nstock which the management had earlier accumulated. If their value\r\nshould prove small the loss would fall on the holders of the floating\r\ndebt and not on the owners of the general mortgage bonds; while the\r\nreturn to the company was assured by arrangement with Drexel & Co.,\r\nBrown Bros. & Co., and J. Lowber Welsh on the one hand, and the Finance\r\nCompany of Pennsylvania on the other. On the whole this plan was gentle\r\neven to tenderness with the creditors of the road, and its failure\r\nrevealed clearly the bondholders’ state of mind. The holders of the\r\ngeneral mortgage refused to fund their coupons for five years, they\r\nrefused to fund them for two years, and they insisted that foreclosure\r\nproceedings should be instituted unless they should receive immediate\r\npayment of their interest. “In view of this,” the receivers were\r\nforced to remark, “it would be idle for [us] to continue the efforts\r\nto readjust the affairs of the company....”[269] The trouble with the\r\nreceivers’ scheme was not that it demanded large concessions,—much\r\nlarger had been asked and granted in 1887,—but that the general\r\nmortgage bondholders felt that on the one hand the road was very nearly\r\nearning fixed charges, so that in the contingency of a foreclosure\r\nsale their interests would be reasonably safe; and on the other that a\r\ndemand for concessions so soon after a complete reorganization of the\r\nproperty was an irritant which might well be resented even at the risk\r\nof some pecuniary loss. Fortunately the assent of the bondholders was\r\nnot necessary to the issue of the coal trust notes, and the receivers\r\nexecuted them under the authority of the court, practically as proposed.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1894, Mr. Simmons, chairman of the old general mortgage\r\nbondholders’ committee, resigned his position, and Mr. Fitzgerald,\r\npresident of the Mercantile Trust Company, was chosen to succeed him.\r\nThe committee presently issued a notice which, after reviewing its\r\nearly activity, went on to say that it had believed it prudent to\r\ngive the receivers every opportunity to familiarize themselves with\r\nthe affairs of the company, but that in its judgment the time had\r\ncome for action to enforce the rights of the bondholders under the\r\nmortgage.[270] In May, 1894, a new general mortgage committee was\r\norganized, with Mr. F. P. Olcott as chairman, designed not directly\r\nto oppose the Fitzgerald Committee, but to hasten the rehabilitation\r\nof the property. The committee prepared a bondholders’ agreement\r\ncalling for the deposit of general mortgage bonds, and in a statement\r\nof their position said: “Difficulties in the way of a foreclosure and\r\nreorganization thereafter are exaggerated; if any danger is wrought by\r\nsuch foreclosure it will fall upon the junior securities and not upon\r\nus.”[271] Lastly, at this time, there was a committee headed by Mr.\r\nEarle, president of the Finance Company of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe first matured suggestion after the failure of the receivers’ plan\r\nappeared in what was known as the Olcott-Earle Agreement, published on\r\nSeptember 25, 1894, which seems to have been in many respects a revival\r\nof that scheme. It proposed to cover the floating debt by the sale\r\nto securityholders of $10,000,000 collateral trust bonds, heretofore\r\nheld in the treasury, and to fund coupons on the general mortgage 4s\r\nfor five years. A syndicate agreed to advance $9,000,000, or as much\r\nthereof as might be needed, to buy the coupons as they should mature.\r\nThe stock was to be held and voted by the reorganization committee\r\nuntil all the money advanced by the syndicate should have been repaid;\r\nthat is, till June, 1898; a second syndicate guaranteed the sale of the\r\ncollateral bonds at 70; and the preferred bondholders were asked to\r\nforego any claims for interest until all the general mortgage coupons\r\nshould have been retired and cancelled. Certain other details are of\r\ninterest. The collateral bond issue was to be taken up by the preferred\r\nbondholders and stockholders, each individual subscribing to 10 per\r\ncent of the par value of his holdings; but the bondholder might, if\r\nhe preferred, pay 3 per cent of the par value of the securities he\r\nowned and receive nothing, instead of paying 10 per cent and getting\r\na collateral bond. Securityholders were given 60 days in which to\r\nassent, and if at the end of that time the number of assents did\r\nnot amount to practically all the interests involved, the committee\r\nproposed to reorganize by foreclosure for the benefit only of those who\r\nhad assented to the plan; while for the future the committee was to\r\nprovide by agreement with the railroad company that the latter should\r\ncall an annual meeting of general and income mortgage bondholders and\r\nstockholders, at which bondholders as well as stockholders should vote\r\nin proportion to the par value of their holdings.[272]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the source of relief sought by this plan\r\nwas precisely that of the receivers’ plan earlier described. Certain\r\nchanges, however, of considerable importance were introduced. The\r\nsubscriptions to the collateral issue were made distinctly obligatory,\r\nand an alternate assessment was provided; greater use was made of\r\nsyndicate assistance; some voting power was given to the bonds; and a\r\nvoting trust was added to ensure permanency of control to the designers\r\nof the reorganization till their work should be complete. On the whole\r\nthere were still few concessions to creditors, and indeed could be\r\nfew. Ten coupons of the general mortgage were to be funded, though it\r\nwas made easy for the bondholder to get cash if he preferred it; the\r\nprovisions concerning subscriptions to the collateral bonds were rather\r\nmore burdensome than before; and the voting trust, while redounding to\r\nthe ultimate advantage of creditors, was only indirectly a concession\r\nto their demands. The grant of voting power to the bondholders would\r\nhave been a great concession, but the wording of the clause was vague\r\nand probably little practical effect would have ensued. As in the\r\nprevious plans, no particular attention was paid to the reduction of\r\nfixed charges.\r\n\r\nSo much for the provisions of the plan. It was a hopeful innovation\r\nfor the suggestions it contained to come from holders of general\r\nmortgage bonds, and seemed to give some evidence of a change of heart;\r\nespecially since the Olcott Committee did secure the assent of a larger\r\nproportion of the issue than had accepted either of the propositions\r\nbefore brought forward. The Fitzgerald Committee strenuously protested,\r\nstill insisting on the advisability of foreclosure; and further\r\nobjections came from Mr. Rice and from the Hartshorne Committee.\r\nNevertheless, the general mortgage as a whole gave its consent, and\r\nultimate shipwreck was due only to the abstention of the income\r\nmortgage bonds.[273] It is not surprising that the income bondholders\r\nshould have felt that the plan had little in it for them. They had\r\nbeen given no voice in its making,—their wishes had at no time been\r\nregarded. During the whole reorganization the question had been of the\r\nterms to which the general mortgage bondholders would consent, and\r\nthe only sign of the existence of junior liens had been an occasional\r\nfearful inquiry as to what would become of them under foreclosure;\r\nuntil now the combination of a voting trust with the expenses of a\r\nsyndicate reorganization, and an assessment upon them and upon the\r\nstock, touched the limit which they would stand. There was, moreover,\r\nat this time no question of the wiping out of the value of their\r\nholdings. The preamble to the Olcott-Earle plan stated that the annual\r\ncharges were $10,477,560 and that the net earnings for 1891 had been\r\n$10,977,398; thus showing that something was left for the junior\r\nsecurities even after the payment of interest on all prior and general\r\nmortgage liens. It seemed also barely possible that the difficulties of\r\na foreclosure, with the danger under the laws of Pennsylvania of losing\r\nthe coal properties of the company, might secure better terms for the\r\nholders of junior obligations in case they should withhold their assent.\r\n\r\nEarly in January, 1895, the following official notice was issued: “The\r\nplan of readjustment, dated October 1, 1894, has not been assented\r\nto by a sufficient number of income bondholders and stockholders to\r\nmake the same effective. The committee now hold over a majority of the\r\ngeneral mortgage bonds, and have, in accordance with the bondholders’\r\nagreement of May 7, 1894, and their circular of October 1, 1894,\r\nnotified the trustees of the general mortgage to bring suit for the\r\nforeclosure thereof ... as expeditiously as possible.”[274] Suit for\r\nforeclosure was brought March 2 in accordance with the announcement,\r\nand the Junior Securities Protective Committee, an organization with\r\npurposes indicated by its name, was allowed to intervene.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Fitzgerald and Olcott committees together prepared and\r\nbrought forward the final reorganization scheme. The conditions now\r\ndiffered from those with which any previous plan had been confronted,\r\nin that it was no longer necessary to seek for as little change as\r\npossible, and a broader, more radical reorganization was in point.\r\n“Unless,” began the scheme, “the managers shall decide to proceed\r\nwithout foreclosure or sale, the properties of the existing Reading\r\ncompanies will be sold and successor companies will be organized\r\nunder the laws of Pennsylvania, and the stock and securities of these\r\nsuccessor companies will be vested in a new company formed, or to be\r\nformed, under the laws of Pennsylvania or of some other state.”\r\n\r\nThere were to be issued:\r\n\r\n  General mortgage 100-year 4 per cent gold bonds,       $114,000,000\r\n  Non-cumulative, 4 per cent first preferred stock\r\n    (subject to an increase of $21,000,000),               28,000,000\r\n  Non-cumulative 4 per cent second preferred stock,        42,000,000\r\n  Common stock (subject to an increase of $21,000,000),    70,000,000\r\n\r\nIf at any time dividends of 4 per cent should have been paid on the\r\nfirst preferred stock for two successive years the company might\r\nconvert the second preferred stock at par, one-half into first\r\npreferred and one-half into common stock. These new issues were\r\nultimately to retire all outstanding securities, to provide for\r\nexpenses of reorganization, and to go for new construction, additions,\r\nbetterments, etc., in the succeeding years. Since, however, it was\r\nobviously impossible to cancel prior liens before maturity, sufficient\r\ngeneral mortgage bonds ($44,550,000) were reserved from immediate\r\nissue to retire these when they should fall due. This left new general\r\nmortgage bonds with four classes of stock against old general mortgage\r\nbonds with three classes of preferred bonds, common stock, and deferred\r\nincomes; and, as might be expected, new general mortgage 4s were given\r\nfor the old general mortgage, second preferred and common stock went\r\nfor preference bonds, and new common stock for old common stock and\r\ndeferred income bonds. Certain cash payments were made on the general\r\nmortgage, and $4,000,000 of the new issue were sold to a syndicate;\r\nbut on the whole we may say that the prior liens and general mortgage\r\nbondholders occupied the same position in the new company which they\r\nhad occupied in the old; that the income bondholders exchanged a bond\r\nwith a lien on income for a stock with a right to dividends; and that\r\nthe floating debt, syndicate, and other expenses were given equal\r\nrights with the general mortgage.\r\n\r\nNo additional mortgage was to be put upon the property, nor was the\r\namount of the first preferred stock to be increased, except with the\r\nconsent, in each instance, of the holders of a majority of the whole\r\namount of each class of preferred stock, given at a meeting of the\r\nstockholders called for that purpose, and with the consent of the\r\nholders of a majority of such part of the common stock as should\r\nbe represented at such meeting, the holders of each class of stock\r\nvoting separately; neither was the amount of the second preferred\r\nstock to be increased, except in a similar way. These careful clauses\r\nmade some provision for future capital requirements necessary which\r\nshould be independent of the consent of the stockholders at any time;\r\nand $20,000,000 general mortgage bonds were accordingly set aside,\r\nto be issued in amounts not greater than $1,500,000 in any one year\r\nfor future construction, equipment, and the like. Additional general\r\nmortgage bonds were provided to retire Philadelphia & Reading Terminal\r\nand Coal & Iron Company bonds up to the sum of $21,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe floating debt, estimated at $25,150,000, was provided for in part\r\nby assessment, and in part by the sale of securities to the syndicate\r\nfor cash; 20 per cent being levied on first, second, and third\r\npreference income bonds, 20 per cent on the stock, and 4 per cent on\r\nthe deferred incomes; while the syndicate agreed to take $4,000,000\r\nof the new general mortgage bonds and $8,000,000 of the new first\r\npreferred stock. The assessment was expected to yield $20,862,289, and\r\nthe syndicate to contribute in cash $7,300,000; leaving an estimated\r\ncash balance of $3,000,000. In addition, the syndicate (Messrs. J. P.\r\nMorgan & Co., J. Kennedy Tod & Co., Hallgarten & Co., and A. Iselin\r\n& Co.) undertook to underwrite the payment of the assessments on the\r\nincome bonds and stock, and to guarantee the extension or payment of\r\nthe improvement mortgage and Coal & Iron Company bonds, most of which\r\nwere to mature in the following two years. No great reduction of fixed\r\ncharges was of course to be expected. The cancellation of the floating\r\ndebt effected, nevertheless, a certain saving, so that charges for\r\nthe future were estimated at $9,300,000 as against net earnings of\r\n$9,839,971 in 1894; while the refunding or extension of maturing bonds\r\nwas looked to for a reduction of $500,000.[275]\r\n\r\nIt is plain that this plan favored the general mortgage bondholders\r\nto the last degree, and admitted them to the reorganized company with\r\nabsolutely no sacrifice save that of the addition of $4,000,000 to the\r\ntotal general mortgage issue. They funded no coupons, they suffered\r\nno diminution of interest and no shaving of principal; they paid no\r\nassessment; and as an additional protection to them, the provision was\r\ninserted that all classes of stock of the new company, except such\r\nnumber as might be disposed of to qualify directors, were to be voted\r\nby three voting trustees, of whom J. P. Morgan and F. P. Olcott were\r\ndesignated in the plan. It has seldom happened in any reorganization\r\nthat a mortgage similar to the general mortgage in this case has been\r\nable to take and hold so strong a position.[276] The secret lay in\r\nthe fact that the road had been earning the interest on the general\r\nmortgage bonds; and that under these circumstances no interest or\r\ncombination of interests could force the holders to accept less than\r\npayment in full of all their claims. The situation could never have\r\narisen in the earlier reorganization; it could never have occurred\r\nwhere a reduction in annual payments was required for the salvation\r\nof the property, or even where the amount of cash to be raised to pay\r\nthe floating debt was so large that junior securityholders would have\r\nrelinquished their holdings rather than pay the necessary assessments.\r\nIn this case none of these conditions existed, and all the burden\r\nwas thrown on the holders of junior mortgages and stock. It must be\r\nremembered, also, that though in ordinary cases the difference between\r\nthe income bonds which the old first and second preference bondholders\r\nsurrendered and the preferred stock which they received would not have\r\nbeen very great, yet here the provisions of the old income mortgage,\r\nwhich forbade the deduction from net earnings of any interest on bonds\r\nsubsequently created until its interest should have been paid, rendered\r\nthe loss more serious.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the holders of junior securities and stock paid the expenses\r\nof reorganization, paid the floating debt, lost what right they had to\r\ninterest before the settlement of interest on subsequently created\r\nclaims, and got only stock, and for the most part second preferred or\r\ncommon stock at that. The general mortgage bondholders got new 4 per\r\ncent bonds, plus 12 per cent, or 2 per cent in cash, had no greater\r\ninterest charges ahead of them, and without paying any assessment or\r\nmaking any concession, except to allow the immediate increase of the\r\namount of their issue by $4,000,000, and thereafter by $1,500,000 per\r\nyear, secured a lien on the assets of the company; a privilege which\r\nwas, moreover, extended to undeposited as well as to deposited bonds.\r\nThe company itself was dissolved, but the new corporation which took\r\nover its assets enjoyed, with slightly decreased charges, freedom from\r\nthe old floating debt and from the extensions and combinations which\r\nhad caused the floating debt of the old management, and seemed besides\r\na strong financial backing.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1896, Judge Atchison of Philadelphia signed the decree for\r\nthe foreclosure and sale of the property of both the Railroad and the\r\nCoal & Iron Companies, and on September 23 the sale took place, C. H.\r\nCoster, of J. P. Morgan & Co., and Francis Lynde Stetson paying an\r\naggregate of $20,500,000 for the whole estate.[277] The sale ended\r\nthe life of the old Reading charter; and in view of the constitution\r\nadopted for the state of Pennsylvania in 1871, which forbade any\r\nrailroad owning more than 30,000 acres of coal land, some device had\r\nto be sought whereby the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad and the\r\nPhiladelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Companies could hold together.\r\nDiligent search revealed the existence of the “National Company,” a\r\ncorporation chartered in 1871 by special act of the legislature of\r\nPennsylvania at the very time when the new constitution was under\r\nconsideration. This company, originally the Excelsior Enterprise\r\nCompany, had power “to purchase, improve, use, and dispose of property\r\nto contractors and others and for other purposes,” with privileges\r\nfully as broad, it was said, as those enjoyed by the Reading before\r\nforeclosure.[278] The National Company now changed its name to the\r\nReading Company, called a special meeting, increased its stock to\r\nthe amount required by the plan of reorganization, and, jointly with\r\nthe Coal & Iron Company, authorized a mortgage to secure bonds up to\r\na possible amount of $135,000,000; to be secured on the property of\r\nboth companies, including the stock and bonds of the Railway Company.\r\nMeanwhile the Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company had been organized\r\nto succeed to the property and franchises of the old Philadelphia &\r\nReading Railroad Company,[279] with a capital stock of $20,000,000 in\r\n$50 shares. The charter of the Coal & Iron Company was preserved in\r\nspite of the foreclosure sale.[280] The next step was for the Reading\r\nCompany to exchange its bonds and stock for the general mortgage bonds\r\nand stock of the two minor companies in the proportions already agreed\r\nupon, and to deposit the securities so obtained in its treasury;\r\nleaving the prior liens the only direct obligations of either company\r\nin the hands of the public. This meant, of course, absolute control\r\nof both companies by the Reading Company; and in the future, when\r\nthe prior liens should mature, it was to mean the replacement of all\r\noutstanding obligations by the obligations of the holding company.\r\nBoth the Railway and the Coal & Iron Companies retained their separate\r\norganizations; the belief was that there was no merger which might be\r\nattacked before the courts; that it only happened that one corporate\r\nindividual had invested in both Railroad and Coal Company shares and\r\nproposed to vote this stock, as was lawful, to further the policies of\r\nwhich it approved.[281]\r\n\r\nRepresentatives of the reorganization managers laid an elaborate\r\ndefence of the legality of these operations before Attorney-General\r\nMcCormick of Pennsylvania, and on January 2 secured an opinion\r\nconfirming the validity of the charter of the Reading Company. “After\r\ndue consideration,” said Mr. McCormick, “I reach the conclusion,\r\nmost reluctantly, that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania cannot now\r\nsuccessfully attack the chartered rights of the Reading Company.... My\r\nview of the whole matter is that the charter of the company authorized\r\nit to do the kind of business in which it engaged prior to January 1,\r\n1874, which business was of the same general character as that in which\r\nit proposes to engage for the purpose of controlling the stocks of the\r\nRailway Company and the Coal & Iron Company.”[282]\r\n\r\nLike the Baltimore & Ohio and the Erie, the Reading has benefited\r\nlargely from the favorable business conditions of the last decade.\r\nThe combined income of the three Reading companies has grown from\r\n$48,422,971 in 1898 to $95,715,088 in 1907.[283] Earnings on the\r\nPhiladelphia & Reading Railway alone are now nearly as great as the\r\ncombined income of the three companies at the earlier date. Net\r\nreceipts were $13,586,710 in 1898 and $29,190,316 in 1907; and the\r\nsurplus over all payments rose from $1,376,420 to $8,741,454 between\r\nthose years. It is important to notice that this showing does not\r\ndepend primarily upon the anthracite business. Not only has the\r\ncarriage of general merchandise increased until it affords to the\r\nrailway a return almost equal to the earnings on coal, but in the coal\r\nbusiness itself bituminous has assumed an importance nearly as great\r\nas that of its harder rival. The Coal & Iron Company still concerns\r\nitself almost entirely with anthracite, and has accordingly been more\r\naffected by special causes. The strike of the miners in September\r\nand October, 1900, and again from May to October, 1902, checked the\r\ngrowth in production for a time; but the increased demand for domestic\r\nconsumption has made possible an increase in output from 4,849,002\r\ntons in 1897 to 10,034,713 in 1907. Increasing business has stimulated\r\nimprovements. Over $15,300,000 have been withdrawn from income by the\r\nPhiladelphia & Reading Railway Company for this purpose between 1896\r\nand 1907; and over $10,000,000 have been invested from earnings by\r\nthe Coal & Iron Company during the same time in colliery improvements\r\nalone. Maintenance charges have been ample. Whereas $1300 to $1500\r\nper mile of single main track are sufficient for normal repairs upon\r\na trunk line, the Philadelphia & Reading Railway has spent over $2600\r\nper mile of line for the last seven years, and over $1700 for the three\r\nyears preceding. As much as $73 has been spent in a single year for\r\naverage maintenance per freight car, $609 in maintenance per passenger\r\ncar, and $3244 in maintenance per locomotive. In consequence of these\r\nrepairs and of renewals upon a considerable scale, the average value of\r\nall locomotives has increased between December 1, 1896, and June 30,\r\n1906, from $4906 to $8393; the average value of freight cars producing\r\nrevenue from $383 to $622; the average value of steam colliers and tugs\r\nfrom $41,533 to $55,451; and the average value of barges from $7930 to\r\n$21,074. The average freight train load was 194 tons in 1897 and 403\r\ntons in 1907. Ton-mileage has increased during the period 159 per cent\r\nand freight train mileage only 27 per cent.\r\n\r\nIt is true that no great sums have been spent from capital account.\r\n$5,137,825 in car trust certificates were outstanding on June 30,\r\n1907, and $5,608,000 in general mortgage bonds have been sold and\r\nthe proceeds invested principally in new equipment, but this is all.\r\nImprovements have been made mainly from earnings, and fixed charges\r\nhave not had to be increased. In fact, the voting trustees stated at\r\nthe expiration of their trusteeship in 1904 that, eliminating the fixed\r\ncharges created since December 1, 1896, on account of the acquisition\r\nof additional properties and interest upon the additional mortgage\r\nbonds issued for the purchase of equipment, the fixed charges of the\r\nReading system were $1,018,065 less for the fiscal year ended June 30,\r\n1904, than they were for the fiscal year ended November 30, 1896.[284]\r\n\r\nIt thus comes about that the finances of the Reading, while not as\r\nsecure as could be desired, are yet in better shape than they have been\r\nfor thirty years. Fixed charges, taxes, and operating expenses[285]\r\ntook 86 per cent of gross income in 1907, but a decline of nearly\r\n$12,000,000 in net earnings must precede a default on any bonds\r\noutstanding. To this margin should be added the considerable amount\r\nby which maintenance expenses now surpass normal figures. An initial\r\ndividend was declared on the Reading Company first preferred stock in\r\nAugust, 1900; on its second preferred in October, 1903; and on its\r\ncommon in February, 1905. Four per cent is now being paid upon all\r\nclasses of stock.\r\n\r\nLarge amounts of Reading stock are held by the Baltimore & Ohio and by\r\nthe Lake Shore. The Reading has again bought control of the Central\r\nof New Jersey, and owns besides a steamship line and something under\r\n500 miles in other subsidiary roads. Its large earnings, its troubles\r\nwith its mine employees, its influence over the supply of a necessity\r\nof life, and the possibility of discrimination which its control of\r\nboth railroad and coal properties affords, have made it a target for\r\nlegislative attack from state and national governments. Action was\r\nbegun by the Department of Justice in 1907 to dissolve the merger\r\nbetween the Reading and the Central of New Jersey. In June of the\r\nprevious year the so-called “commodity clause” of the Hepburn Act\r\nforbade any railroad company to transport in interstate commerce any\r\narticle except timber and the manufactured products thereof which it\r\nshould have produced, or in which it should have any interest, except\r\nthose products necessary and intended for its own use in its business\r\nas common carrier. The legality of the Reading’s position in these\r\nmatters is yet to be decided by the courts. The student may well doubt\r\nwhether legislative action will ever succeed in preventing the common\r\nownership of the Reading railroad and mining interests. What is more\r\nprobable is that a strict governmental control will come to be imposed.\r\nAgainst this proper development no appeal to legal technicalities will\r\navail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTHERN\r\n\r\n  Richmond & Danville—East Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia—Formation\r\n    of the Southern Railway Security Company—Growth and Combinations\r\n    —Failure and reorganization of the East Tennessee—Reversal of\r\n    position between the Richmond & Danville and the Richmond & West\r\n    Point Terminal—Acquisition of the Central of Georgia—Failure and\r\n    reorganization of the whole system—Subsequent development.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the present time there are in the South five great railway systems:\r\nthe Atlantic Coast Line; the Seaboard Air Line; the Southern Railway;\r\nthe Louisville & Nashville Railroad; and the Illinois Central Railroad,\r\nwhich cover, in the order named, the territory between the Atlantic\r\nOcean and the Mississippi River.\r\n\r\nThe backbone of the Southern Railway is formed by the old Richmond &\r\nDanville and East Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia companies: of which the\r\nfirst formerly stretched with its subsidiary lines from Washington and\r\nRichmond on the north to Atlanta, Georgia, and Greenville, Mississippi,\r\non the south and west; and the second reached from Bristol, Tennessee,\r\nin a great half circle to the ocean at Brunswick, Georgia, and by means\r\nof the Mobile & Birmingham straight to the Gulf at Mobile.\r\n\r\nThe Richmond & Danville was opened in 1856 between Richmond and\r\nDanville, Virginia. It was largely aided by the state of Virginia.\r\nThree-fifths of its stock were owned by the state in 1867, there was a\r\nstate loan of $400,000, and a state guarantee of $200,000 besides.[286]\r\nIn natural consequence the state elected three of the six directors.\r\nIt was not long, however, before the state was able to relieve itself\r\nof a large part of its investment. On the 31st of August, 1871, all\r\nof the state shares were taken over by the Pennsylvania Railroad\r\nCompany.[287] The money sunk in the company’s bonds still remained.\r\nFrom Danville the Richmond & Danville steadily pushed south in the\r\nyears following 1856. Under the leadership of the Pennsylvania it\r\nbecame its ambition to open direct rail communication from the great\r\nNorthern cities to the heart of North and South Carolina and Georgia.\r\nTo obtain a ninety-mile extension to Charlotte the company leased\r\nthe North Carolina Railroad, 223 miles in length.[287] To get into\r\nAtlanta it allied itself with the Atlanta & Richmond Air Line Company,\r\nprojected to construct a line between Atlanta and Charlotte.[288] In\r\n1878 it bought a controlling interest in the Charlotte, Columbia &\r\nAugusta Railroad and secured entrance to the latter city.[289] The\r\nPennsylvania aided the new enterprise by advances from time to time,\r\nand when the current liabilities became unmanageable took $1,000,000 of\r\na new refunding mortgage.[290]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the East Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia Railroad had been\r\nestablished to the west of the Richmond & Danville, in the heart of\r\nthe southern Appalachians.[291] This company was a consolidation in\r\n1869 of the East Tennessee & Virginia Railroad, from Bristol, on the\r\nboundary between Virginia and Tennessee, to Knoxville, Tennessee; and\r\nthe East Tennessee & Georgia Railroad, from Knoxville, Tennessee, to\r\nDalton, Georgia. Both roads were aided by the state of Tennessee. In\r\n1870, however, the new company extinguished its debt to the state by\r\nthe payment of $4,117,761 in state bonds. Not long after the completion\r\nof its line from Bristol to Dalton, the East Tennessee fell under the\r\ncontrol of the Pennsylvania Railroad, which already dominated its\r\nneighbor to the east. To facilitate the control and to unify the\r\ninterests of the Pennsylvania south of Washington a “Southern Railway\r\nSecurity Company” was formed, with a capital of $5,000,000. This\r\ncompany was entrusted with a majority of the stock of the Richmond &\r\nDanville and of the East Tennessee. It also controlled the Coast Line\r\nrailroads from Richmond to Charleston, and the Memphis & Charleston\r\nfrom Chattanooga to Memphis.[292] Unfortunately the financial results\r\nof the combination were disappointing. Of the subsidiary roads the East\r\nTennessee managed to pay at least 3 per cent on its capital stock from\r\n1872 to 1876; but the Richmond & Danville paid nothing, the Coast Lines\r\nnothing, and the Memphis & Charleston barely earned the 3 per cent\r\nguaranteed under its lease. In 1873, therefore, a special meeting was\r\nheld at the office of the Southern Railway Security Company to consider\r\nthe propriety of making sale of certain properties of the company.[293]\r\nIn 1874 the lease of the Memphis & Charleston was surrendered,[294]\r\nand in 1876 the bulk of the securities held, outside of the Richmond &\r\nDanville stock, were disposed of.[295]\r\n\r\nThe retirement of the Southern Railway Security Company marked the\r\nbeginning of the withdrawal of the Pennsylvania from investment in\r\nthe South. For the rest, it left the lines north of South Carolina\r\nin three main competing groups. There were the Coast Lines from\r\nRichmond south, the Richmond & Danville, and the East Tennessee,\r\nVirginia & Georgia properties. And stretching from west to east was\r\nthe Memphis & Charleston, which was already in financial difficulties\r\nof a serious nature. All three of these groups were now thrown upon\r\ntheir own resources; and two of them, at least, took vigorous measures\r\nin self-protection. The policy of the East Tennessee was the most\r\naggressive. Shut up in the narrow valley between the Clinch and the\r\nGreat Smoky Mountains, and flanked by hostile roads, it conceived it\r\nto be necessary for it to acquire connections to the south, to the\r\neast, and to the west. Accordingly, it leased the Memphis & Charleston\r\nin 1877 and obtained an outlet upon the Mississippi River.[296] In\r\n1878 it bought the Georgia Southern and the Selma, Rome & Dalton\r\nand provided itself with a line as far south as the Flint River in\r\nAlabama.[297] In 1881 it bought the Alabama Central, extending some 96\r\nmiles west from Selma. The same year it secured control of the Macon\r\n& Brunswick in Georgia, and began construction from Macon to Rome to\r\ncomplete a line to the South Atlantic coast.[298] In the north it made\r\nan alliance with the Norfolk & Western, which opened that company’s\r\nline from Bristol to Norfolk,[299] and arranged with the Louisville &\r\nNashville and the Kentucky Central for construction to a connection at\r\nthe Kentucky-Tennessee state line which should open to it the business\r\nof the Central West.[300]\r\n\r\nThe Richmond & Danville fell under the control of a group of\r\ncapitalists who already controlled the Atlantic Coast lines and held an\r\ninterest in the East Tennessee, and who now bought the 24,000 shares\r\nof Danville stock still held by the Pennsylvania Railroad.[301] Like\r\nits rival, it enlarged its system. It leased the Atlanta & Charlotte\r\nAir Line in 1881,[302] with certain minor roads in the Carolinas and in\r\nGeorgia. In 1882, under the charter of the Georgia Pacific, it began\r\nconstruction westward from Atlanta to the Mississippi. It did not\r\nstretch out, as did the East Tennessee, but it secured a very complete\r\ncontrol of the territory between Richmond in the north and Augusta,\r\nSavannah, and Atlanta in the south. In 1881, also, the Richmond &\r\nDanville took a step destined to have important consequences. Since\r\nit desired to acquire certain railroads, and since its charter\r\nallowed it to hold stock in none but connecting lines, it caused to\r\nbe incorporated a so-called Richmond & West Point Terminal Railway\r\n& Warehouse Company, with authority to acquire stocks and bonds of\r\nrailroad companies in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee,\r\nKentucky, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and other states. This\r\ncompany increased its stock by October, 1881, to $3,000,000; of which\r\nthe Richmond & Danville then owned $1,510,000. The most important\r\nacquisition which it made at the time was the Virginia Midland Railway,\r\nfrom Alexandria, Virginia, to Danville; but other additions were to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nThe independent action of the Danville and East Tennessee companies\r\nwas followed by a new consolidation which reunited most of the lines\r\ndominated by the old Security Company. In response to queries in\r\nAugust, 1883, Mr. Calvin S. Brice admitted that a syndicate in which he\r\nwas interested had bought control of the Richmond & Danville.\r\n\r\n“We have secured,” said he, “about 28,000 of the 50,000 shares of stock\r\nissued by the Richmond & Danville Company. Our syndicate controls,\r\nbesides our new purchase, the East Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia\r\nRailway and the Chesapeake & York River line of steamers that ply\r\nbetween West Point, on the Chesapeake, and Baltimore, and has close\r\ntraffic arrangements with the Clyde steamers, which run between New\r\nYork and Philadelphia and all Southern points. Our purpose is to\r\nconfine all our railroad and steamship lines under one management, and\r\nto equip and operate the system in the best possible manner.”[303]\r\n\r\nIt appears from this statement that the capitalists who controlled the\r\nEast Tennessee now again consolidated with the leading interests of\r\nthe Richmond & Danville and lines east, albeit changes in personnel\r\nand transfers of holdings occurred. Return to the old combination was\r\nmade desirable by the more intimate connection of the two groups of\r\nroads. The Western North Carolina had been opened across the mountains\r\nof North Carolina in 1882. This had made practicable the diversion of\r\nthe western traffic of the East Tennessee from the Norfolk & Western\r\nto the Richmond & Danville; a traffic which the northern connections\r\nof the East Tennessee promised largely to increase. Consolidation\r\nwas doubtless also prompted by the desire to save the East Tennessee\r\nfrom serious financial difficulty which threatened it. It had become\r\napparent that this company, at least, had severely taxed its strength\r\nin the rapid extension of mileage which had followed 1876. Before that\r\ntime its position had been secure. It had possessed a monopoly of the\r\nsomewhat limited local traffic between Chattanooga and Bristol, and had\r\nformed part of the most direct route between New York, Philadelphia,\r\nBaltimore, and Washington, and towns in Tennessee, Northern Alabama,\r\nand Mississippi. Its extensions had changed the situation. They had\r\nbrought it into touch with the Mississippi River and the Atlantic\r\nOcean, and had increased its fighting power; but they had also endowed\r\nit at large cost with a group of poorly equipped, unprofitable lines\r\nlocated in a keenly competitive territory. The Selma, Rome & Dalton had\r\nbeen purchased just after a foreclosure sale. The Macon & Brunswick had\r\nnever been able to earn much more than working expenses. The Alabama\r\nCentral had not seen fit to publish its financial figures after 1878,\r\nwhile the Memphis & Charleston, as we have seen, had turned to the East\r\nTennessee only to escape bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nThe East Tennessee had hoped to make profitable the lines which it had\r\nso rapidly acquired. Unfortunately the company was poorly equipped for\r\nsuch a task. Its finance had been extravagant. In 1875, on 269 miles\r\nof lines there had been $7317 in stock and $15,620 in bonds per mile.\r\nIn 1883 the mortgage bonds and car trusts outstanding per mile owned\r\namounted to $23,444, the income bonds to $15,404, and the capital stock\r\nto $41,079. A grand total of $79,927 as compared with the $22,937 of\r\neight years earlier, and an average of almost $100,000 in securities\r\nper mile of new line acquired! Ninety-nine per cent of net income\r\nwas being absorbed in paying interest on all classes of securities,\r\nalthough maintenance figures were kept as low as $630 per mile of line.\r\nThis large volume of stocks and bonds made improvement from earnings\r\nimpossible, and prevented conservative management by taking from the\r\nstockholders any chance of dividends, and by reducing the quotations of\r\ncommon stock to less than $5 per share. And though in some respects\r\nthe location of the system was good, the route which it offered to much\r\nof its business was indirect, the competition which it had to meet was\r\nsevere, and its Atlantic terminal, Brunswick, was of small importance\r\ncompared with the thriving cities of Savannah and Norfolk. The result\r\nwas a failure to secure the gains from consolidation which had been\r\nexpected. Surplus earnings were continuously small, and current bills\r\nwere left to run; until by 1883 the floating debt had become so large\r\nthat an issue of $1,200,000 in debenture bonds was required to take\r\ncare of it.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the East Tennessee to weld its connections into an\r\nefficient transportation system left it helpless in face of the panic\r\nof 1884. Earnings fell off in that year, a directors’ committee was\r\nappointed,[304] and the resulting report revealed a plain inability on\r\nthe part of the company to meet its charges.\r\n\r\n  “The interest charges proper for the calendar year\r\n    1885 are,” said the committee,                         $1,476,505.85\r\n\r\n  “To this must be added the principal due on car trusts\r\n    and debentures in 1885,                                   280,954.11\r\n                                                           -------------\r\n  “Or a total of                                           $1,757,459.96\r\n\r\n  “The payments on similar account will be—\r\n     in 1886,                                              $1,739,196.28\r\n     in 1887,                                               1,720,932.60\r\n     gradually decreasing until the debentures and car\r\n     trusts being paid off in 1894, the total fixed\r\n     charges for the year 1895 will be                     $1,295,970.00\r\n\r\n  “The net revenue for the year 1883–4 was                  1,699,925.84\r\n\r\n  “The net revenue for 1885 and 1886, allowing for the\r\n    decrease in earnings following the panic, and\r\n    supposing the road to be operated for 60 per cent,\r\n    may be estimated at                                    $1,400,000.00\r\n\r\n“This will leave,” said the committee, “an annual deficit of $350,000,\r\nto which must be added a total of $1,000,000 required by the general\r\nmanager for steel rails, iron bridges, and other needed improvements.\r\n\r\n“The sums for covering these expenses should not be raised by temporary\r\nloans, as this would not relieve the company of its embarrassments\r\nnor place its finances upon a sound footing. It cannot be raised by\r\nan additional mortgage, on account of the provisions of the mortgage\r\nsecuring the income bonds. It must and can be raised from a funding of\r\ncoupons which shall leave the earnings of the company sufficiently free\r\nto meet the demands upon them. The committee therefore recommends:\r\n\r\n(1) “That the holders of the consolidated 5 per cent bonds be asked\r\nto fund four coupons, being those maturing January and July 1, 1885,\r\nand January and July 1, 1886, by depositing said four coupons with the\r\nCentral Trust Company of New York, as trustee, and receiving instead\r\nthe company’s funded coupon bond dated July 1, 1885, and bearing 6 per\r\ncent interest per annum from that date, ... which bond shall run ten\r\nyears from its date and be redeemable at the pleasure of the company at\r\npar and accrued interest after three years, on three months’ notice;\r\nsuch funded coupon bond to be secured by the coupons so deposited, the\r\nlien of which will be in all respects preserved.\r\n\r\n“The total extensions under this clause would be $1,467,400.\r\n\r\n(2) “That the holders of the $2,000,000 of the Cincinnati & Georgia\r\nDivision first mortgage 6 per cent bonds be asked to fund four coupons,\r\n... being those maturing March and September 1, 1885, and March and\r\nSeptember 1, 1886, ... and accepting in lieu thereof a funded coupon\r\nbond ... dated September 1, 1885.\r\n\r\n“The total amount extended under this clause would be $240,000.\r\n\r\n(3) “That the holders of the debentures be asked to extend for ten\r\nyears such of the debentures as fall due during the years 1885 and\r\n1886, and to accept similar debentures running from five to ten years,\r\nfor the interest....\r\n\r\n“The total amount extended under this clause would be $373,200.\r\n\r\n(4) “That an arrangement be made with the holders of the car trust\r\ncertificates of the company, series A, for an extension for ten years\r\nof all the payments of principal falling due in 1885 and 1886, being\r\n$100,000 in each year.\r\n\r\n“The total amount extended under this clause would be $200,000.”[305]\r\n\r\nThe committee had an apology to offer for the state in which the\r\ncompany was placed. “The actual cost of the 190 miles of the new roads\r\nconstructed by the company has largely exceeded,” said they, “the\r\nestimated cost. The physical condition of the roads purchased by the\r\ncompany necessitated the expenditure of large sums in the improvement\r\nof roadway and track; the construction and reconstruction of bridge\r\nmasonry and bridge superstructure. The facilities for the conduct of\r\nthe company’s business were entirely inadequate to the requirements\r\nof its increasing traffic and had to be enlarged. Unfortunately the\r\ncompany did not fully provide for these expenditures, and the shrinkage\r\nof the value of its securities greatly aggravated the evil.” This much\r\nwas very true. In its criticism of existing facilities the committee\r\nwas on sure ground. In its suggestions for relief it was less well\r\nadvised. It seems to have felt that the East Tennessee’s difficulties\r\nwere due to a temporary inability to raise cash for the improvement of\r\nits roadbed and equipment, and that the suspension of certain charges\r\nfor a few years would allow the expenditure of liberal sums from\r\nincome, ensure the improvement of the road, and bring about a condition\r\nof permanent prosperity. The truth was that the East Tennessee was\r\nin too bad a shape to be reëstablished by such means. The heavily\r\nburdened and physically defective lines which made up the system were\r\npast being restored from income even with the aid of a funding of a\r\nfew years’ coupons. They required a definitive surrender of portions\r\nof the claims against them, extensive new charges to capital account,\r\nand a correspondingly complete reconstruction of their whole operating\r\nplant.[306] The practical service which the committee rendered was\r\nnot in suggesting an adequate remedy for existing troubles, but in\r\nmaking plain how serious these troubles were. So imminent, in fact, did\r\nthey show collapse to be, that the management determined to forestall\r\nhostile action by themselves asking for the appointment of a receiver;\r\nand on January 7 the Circuit Court appointed Henry Fink to that\r\nposition.[307] The committee’s funding scheme fell of its own weight.\r\nThe decrease in the earnings of the company, a truer appreciation of\r\nits condition, and, it may be surmised, the influence of New York\r\nbanking houses, forced it to make room for a thorough plan of financial\r\nreconstruction.\r\n\r\nAction looking toward reorganization of the East Tennessee, Virginia &\r\nGeorgia began with the year 1886. In January Mr. Nelson Robinson,[308]\r\nwho had held proxies for a controlling stock interest at the\r\nprevious election, returned from Europe; and after a conference with\r\ncertain large bondholders agreed with them to draft a plan for the\r\nreorganization of the property. A reorganization committee was chosen\r\nfrom members of large banking firms,[309] meetings were held, and in\r\nthe first part of February, 1886, a scheme was put forth. This plan\r\ncomprised the following points:\r\n\r\n(1) Reduction of fixed charges;\r\n\r\n(2) Exchange of new bonds and preferred stock for old bonds;\r\n\r\n(3) Assessment on the junior securities;\r\n\r\n(4) Foreclosure.\r\n\r\nForeclosure was to take place under the consolidated mortgage. A new\r\n5 per cent seventy-year consolidated mortgage was then to be created.\r\nEnough of the bonds under this mortgage were to be reserved to retire\r\nthe liens prior to the existing consolidated mortgage as they should\r\nmature, and the balance was to be used for taking up the outstanding\r\nconsolidated mortgage bonds, the Cincinnati & Georgia division bonds,\r\nand the ten-year debentures. It was estimated that the exchanges would\r\nreduce the annual interest charge from $1,757,460 to $994,737.[310]\r\nThis necessitated considerable demands upon old securityholders. Thus\r\nthe old consolidated mortgage bonds bearing 5 per cent received only\r\n60 per cent of their face value in new consolidated bonds with the\r\nsame rate of interest; and the old 6 per cent Cincinnati & Georgia\r\ndivision bonds received only 48 per cent in consols, besides suffering\r\na decrease in interest rate from 6 to 5 per cent. The difference was\r\nmade up by the allowance of preferred stock, to which, moreover, was\r\ngiven the right for five years to elect a majority of the board of\r\ndirectors, unless before that time the new company should have paid\r\nout of its net earnings 5 per cent dividends on such preferred stock\r\nfor two full successive years. To the Cincinnati & Georgia division\r\nbonds were given 62 per cent in new first preferred besides the 48\r\nper cent in bonds,—a total of 110 per cent; upon which the yield in\r\nprosperous times might exactly equal the yield on the securities which\r\nthey surrendered. To the consolidated bonds were given 50 per cent in\r\nnew first preferred, making possible a total return greater than that\r\nwhich they had formerly enjoyed. For the debentures was made the same\r\nprovision as for the divisional bonds. In order that net earnings might\r\ngo first of all to the prior liens and to the above securities, new\r\nsecond preferred and common stock was issued for the benefit of the old\r\nincome bonds and stock. Of these the income bonds received 100 per cent\r\nin new second preferred; while the old preferred received 100 per cent\r\nand the old common stock 40 per cent in new common. Only in return for\r\ntheir assessments did the income bonds receive first preferred stock,\r\nand even for their assessment the common stock took second preferred.\r\nCash assessments were 5 per cent on the income mortgage and 6 per cent\r\non the new common stock. This was expected to yield $2,475,000, which,\r\nwith a surplus of new securities in the treasury of $1,534,000, was\r\nthought sufficient to liquidate outstanding car trusts and to provide\r\nthe company with a fund available for future use.[311]\r\n\r\nThe plan may be criticised in some respects. It made no adequate\r\nprovision for future capital requirements. Two millions and a half of\r\ncash and two millions of securities were considerable sums in hand,\r\nbut of these over half a million was in the form of stock, and from\r\nthe rest had to be deducted at least a million and a half for the\r\nliquidation of car trusts. This left, it is true, enough for existing\r\nneeds,[312] but it did not allow for constantly recurring and\r\nlegitimate demands for improvements out of capital in future years.\r\nMoreover, the securities given for the consolidated, the Cincinnati\r\n& Georgia division, and the debenture bonds exceeded by 10 per cent\r\nthe nominal value of the bonds retired by them. But on the whole the\r\nreorganization plan was an excellent attempt to solve a difficult\r\nproblem. It proceeded on a sound principle, it laid the burden on the\r\nproper parties, it avoided a funding of current liabilities, and even\r\nin respect to the volume of securities outstanding it accomplished a\r\nmuch needed reform by wiping out 60 per cent of the almost worthless\r\ncommon stock.[313] It was accordingly accepted by the securityholders.\r\nOn March 18, the reorganization committee obtained a decree of\r\nsale.[314] By May 1, practically all the consolidated and income bonds,\r\nwith a majority of the preferred stock, had assented;[315] and on May\r\n25, 1886, the East Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia Railroad was sold\r\nfor $10,250,000 to a representative of the reorganization committee.\r\nPrevious to this the opposition committee, which had been formed by\r\nthe minority stockholders, had disbanded.[316] The final step was\r\nthe organization of the East Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia Railway,\r\nwhich on July 1 took over the title to the East Tennessee, Virginia &\r\nGeorgia Railroad and branches, a controlling interest in the stock of\r\nthe Knoxville & Ohio, and a controlling interest in the stock of the\r\nMemphis & Charleston Railroad Company.[317]\r\n\r\nDuring this time the Richmond & Danville had not been standing still.\r\nIt will be remembered that in 1883 the capitalists who dominated the\r\nEast Tennessee and the Coast Lines had purchased a controlling interest\r\nin this company, with the purpose, according to Mr. Brice, of confining\r\nall their railroad and steamship lines under one management and of\r\noperating the system in the best possible manner. These gentlemen\r\nhad found the earnings of the Richmond & Danville sufficiently\r\nunsatisfactory and the need for improvements sufficiently great to\r\nlead them to pass the interest on its debenture bonds in October,\r\n1883. The net earnings for 1882, out of which this dividend would have\r\nbeen paid, they found had been fully taken up by the fixed charges\r\nand the expenses for new equipment and betterments. The net earnings\r\nfor 1883 they believed sure to show large gains, but still not likely\r\nto be equal to necessary expenditures.[318] Strict economy was to be\r\nthe order of the day. In the three previous years the company had\r\naccumulated a large floating debt. This the new management reduced\r\nmore than one-half by the end of 1885. The funded debt it allowed to\r\nincrease largely, but the earnings it managed somewhat to improve. In\r\ngeneral, however, it secured no very striking gains. Union in interest\r\nwith the East Tennessee and the Coast Lines modified the severity of\r\ncompetition, but the panic of 1884 checked business, and the real\r\nsaving in operating cost was very slight.[319]\r\n\r\nIn their search for means to reduce expenses the owners of the Richmond\r\n& Danville came across the Richmond & West Point Terminal Company.\r\nBy 1884 this company was in peaceful possession of 1815.8 miles of\r\nrailroad, which included all the important branches of the Richmond\r\n& Danville except the North Carolina Railroad, from Goldsboro to\r\nCharlotte, and the Atlanta & Charlotte Air Line, from Charlotte to\r\nAtlanta. It had been obliged to issue notes to retire its floating debt\r\nin 1883,[320] but had no earnings apart from dividends on the stock\r\nwhich it held, and no expenses other than its cost of administration\r\nand the interest on the notes above mentioned and on its floating debt.\r\nThere was a possibility, nevertheless, that the maintenance of the\r\ncompany involved the Richmond & Danville in unnecessary outlay, and\r\ncaused a certain loss of efficiency through indirectness of control.\r\nThe Terminal Company had originally been necessary because the Richmond\r\n& Danville could by its charter hold stock in none but connecting\r\nlines. By 1885 this prohibition had been removed, and there was open an\r\nopportunity to consolidate the system.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1886 the directors of the Richmond & Danville appointed a\r\ncommittee to report a plan of union with the Richmond & West Point\r\nTerminal.[321] Apparently this committee recommended the elimination\r\nof the Terminal Company; for in April it was known that the Richmond\r\n& Danville was trying to buy from the Terminal the stock of certain\r\nof the more important branches which it had formerly controlled.[322]\r\nIn that month the Richmond & Danville leased the Virginia Midland\r\nRailway[323] and the Western North Carolina; in May it took over the\r\nCharlotte, Columbia & Augusta and the Columbia & Greenville; in June\r\nthe Northeastern of Georgia; and in October the Washington, Ohio &\r\nWestern, or a total of 1483 miles out of the 1839 held by the central\r\ncorporation.[324] At the same time the Richmond & Danville transferred\r\ninto its own treasury $13,617,400 in stock and bonds of subsidiary\r\ncompanies, giving in return 25,000 shares of the Terminal’s own stock,\r\nand a guarantee of the Virginia Midland’s general mortgage bonds. This\r\ndone, the Danville Railroad threw the rest of its holdings of Terminal\r\nstock upon the market; where they were bought by investors who knew\r\nnothing of the above transactions. The operation left the Terminal\r\nhigh and dry. It was of no further use to the Richmond & Danville, for\r\nthat company had made arrangements with its branch lines direct; and\r\nit could not launch upon an independent existence, because the greater\r\npart of its mileage was in its rival’s hands.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the small Terminal holders it so happened that men\r\nof large wealth and resourcefulness were interested with them. Under\r\nthe leadership of these capitalists the Terminal Company began in its\r\nturn the purchase of Danville stock. It may have been that the East\r\nTennessee group who had acquired a majority in 1883 had meantime parted\r\nwith their holdings, or members of that syndicate may have sold in 1886\r\nto take advantage of a favorable price.[325] At any rate, 25,000 shares\r\nwere rapidly acquired, and the control of the company obtained. This\r\ndone the new Terminal interests turned to the East Tennessee, Virginia\r\n& Georgia. Negotiations were at once begun, and culminated in an\r\nagreement in 1887 by which the Brice-Thomas group sold 65,000 shares of\r\nEast Tennessee first preferred for $4,000,000 in cash and 50,000 shares\r\nof new Terminal common. Since the Tennessee first preferred elected a\r\nmajority of the directors this ensured control. At the same time the\r\nRichmond Terminal provided for its floating debt, and for the purchase\r\nof the balance of the Richmond & Danville shares outstanding.[326]\r\n\r\nThus was the Richmond & West Point Terminal Company saved, and the\r\nprincipal railroads east and west of the southern Appalachians still\r\nkept under common control. The new grouping was weaker than the old,\r\nhowever, in that it did not include the Coast Line railroads. It was\r\nalso imperfect as regards the nature of the control possessed over the\r\nEast Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia. It has been said that the Richmond\r\nTerminal held a majority of the first preferred stock of this latter\r\nroad.[327] By the terms of the Tennessee reorganization of 1886 this\r\nstock was to have the right for five years to elect a majority of the\r\ndirectors, unless before that time it should have received 5 per cent\r\ndividends for two successive years. This gave control to the Terminal\r\nCompany; but it plainly made a control precarious which rested, as this\r\ndid, on ownership of first preferred alone. In 1887 4 per cent was paid\r\nin dividends, and in 1888 5 per cent. In 1888, accordingly, a lease\r\nwas drawn up, and the Richmond & Danville took the operation of the\r\nroad for ninety-nine years. For four years it agreed to pay over 33⅓\r\nper cent of the gross earnings; for five years more 35 per cent; and\r\nso on until 37 per cent should be reached. And, further, it guaranteed\r\nthat the percentage allowed should be sufficient to pay all the East\r\nTennessee’s fixed charges, including 5 per cent annually on the first\r\npreferred shares outstanding.[328]\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that the ethics of the Tennessee’s lease were\r\nquestionable. The East Tennessee reorganization had invested the\r\nfirst preferred stock of that company with temporary authority. To\r\nuse this to bind the property for years to come was neither fair to\r\nthe other stockholders, nor in accordance with the spirit of the\r\nreorganization plan. We need not, therefore, be surprised at the prompt\r\napplication for an injunction and for the appointment of a receiver\r\nwhich occurred.[329] In a circular to the second preferred and junior\r\nstockholders the opponents of the lease urged that its consummation\r\nwould constitute an abuse of power on the part of the existing\r\nboard; that it was entirely in the interests of the first preferred\r\nstockholders; that under no circumstances could the junior stockholders\r\nderive any income from the lease; that it failed to provide other\r\nsafeguards and was in many respects improvident and imperfect. In one\r\nsuit before State Chancellor Gibson at Knoxville, Tennessee, emphasis\r\nwas laid on the statutory prohibition of the consolidation of competing\r\nlines. In another, petition was even made that the holders of the first\r\npreferred stock be enjoined from electing a majority of the board of\r\ndirectors at the approaching meeting.[330] Chancellor Gibson handed\r\ndown two vigorous opinions. He refused to enjoin the voting of the\r\nfirst preferred stock, on the ground that the plaintiffs had been in\r\npossession for two years of stock certificates which bore on their face\r\nthe conditions and agreements under which they were issued, and that\r\nthe complaint was not justified, either in law or equity.[331] But he\r\nheld that the East Tennessee had no power under its charter to lease\r\nits road as it had done; that the combination of the East Tennessee and\r\nthe Richmond & Danville was forbidden by the law of Tennessee against\r\nthe consolidation of competing lines; and that similar prohibitions in\r\nthe laws and constitution of Georgia were so stringent as to imperil\r\nthe East Tennessee’s charter in case the lease should be carried\r\nthrough.[332] This effectually checked the lease. After Chancellor\r\nGibson’s first opinion the East Tennessee election had been held and\r\nthe arrangement with the Richmond & Danville approved.[333] After\r\nhis second the lease was cancelled, and the management of the East\r\nTennessee restored to its own officers.[334] The Richmond Terminal\r\nwas still left in control of the property. It was forced, however, to\r\nsecure a majority of all the East Tennessee stock outstanding if it\r\nwished to make its control permanent, and it was prevented from using\r\nthe power temporarily given a section of the stock to bring about a\r\nninety-nine-year arrangement distasteful to the majority.\r\n\r\nMaster of the Richmond & Danville, the East Tennessee, and their allied\r\nlines, the Richmond Terminal now took one step further; it acquired\r\nthe Central Railroad & Banking Company of Georgia. The importance of\r\nthis was very great. The Central Company owned the most considerable of\r\nthe lines in Georgia and Eastern Alabama. It stretched from Savannah\r\nand Port Royal on the Atlantic coast to Spartanburg, South Carolina,\r\non the north; to Atlanta, Birmingham, and Montgomery on the west; and\r\nto Albany, Georgia, and to Columbia on the south. Its system had been\r\nformed by a consolidation in 1872 of the Central Railroad from Savannah\r\nto Macon with the Macon & Western from Macon to Atlanta,[335] and was\r\ncompact, ably managed, and profitable. Previous to June, 1847, the\r\nCentral Railroad Company had paid seven dividends aggregating 10.68\r\nper cent. From June, 1847, to June, 1889, the Central Railroad and\r\nthe Central Railroad & Banking Company which succeeded it, had paid\r\nseventy-five dividends aggregating 337.5 per cent,[336] besides stock\r\ndividends of 8 per cent in 1854 and 12 per cent in 1861, and a dividend\r\nof 40 per cent in certificates of indebtedness in 1881. It was paying\r\n8 per cent in 1888 when the Richmond & Danville was paying 5, and the\r\nEast Tennessee was congratulating itself on the 5 per cent which it was\r\nable to turn over to its first preferred stock.[337]\r\n\r\nSo fruitful a piece of railroad property was naturally looked on as\r\ndesirable, especially since its acquisition was to free the East\r\nTennessee from one of its most dangerous competitors. From a traffic\r\npoint of view, nevertheless, the advantages of a consolidation were\r\ndoubtful. The local business of the Central was likely to be little\r\nincreased by a merger. The through business was in danger of being\r\ndecreased. The Central lines ran on the whole east and west. It was to\r\ntheir interest to carry freight from Georgia, Alabama, and the West to\r\nSavannah, and thence to send it north by way of the Ocean Steamship\r\nCompany which they controlled, and from which they obtained in 1889\r\none-fifth of their total net earnings; while the Richmond Terminal’s\r\ninterest was to send this traffic north by land so as to secure for\r\nits own railroads the long haul. The advantages to the Terminal of a\r\nunion depended on the price at which the Central Railroad could be\r\nacquired. The purchase was made, and the price was a high one. And this\r\nprice was paid, it was freely charged, not in pursuance of an honest\r\nthough mistaken judgment, but in order to allow a large personal gain\r\nto individual capitalists who were interested in both the Central and\r\nthe Terminal Companies.\r\n\r\nAmong the most prominent owners of Central of Georgia stock at this\r\ntime were members of the Logan-Rice group of financiers, who had begun\r\nto accumulate holdings at least as early as 1886. The average price\r\nwhich these parties paid was later estimated at 130, and their holdings\r\nwere apparently secured with a view to resale at a higher figure. At\r\nany rate, when 40,000 shares had been purchased, a double operation\r\nwas put through. The shares bought were turned over, with $400,000\r\ncash, to a newly formed “Georgia Company,” and for them $4,000,000 in\r\n5 per cent trust bonds and $12,000,000 in Georgia Company stock were\r\nreceived in exchange. And, second, a vigorous campaign was entered upon\r\nto secure control of the Richmond Terminal. Sully resigned the Terminal\r\npresidency in April. For his vacant place the Logan-Rice people\r\noffered General Alexander of the Central of Georgia, and the Terminal\r\nmanagement supported John H. Inman. The struggle which ensued was most\r\nextraordinary. The existing board of directors charged the Central\r\ngroup with trying to unload their Georgia Company’s stock upon the\r\nTerminal system; and the Logan-Rice party insinuated that the purchase\r\nof the East Tennessee Railroad had been the occasion of fraudulent\r\nprofits to the Terminal directors.[338]\r\n\r\n“We understand,” declared the directors, “that a majority of the\r\nnames thus far proposed by the parties soliciting proxies to be cast\r\nfor directors and president of this company are gentlemen who are\r\nwell known to be the owners of a majority of the stock of the Georgia\r\nCompany, which owns railroads whose business and interests are at\r\nall points of our system in competition with and antagonistic to the\r\nbusiness and interests of this Company; any diversion of traffic,\r\nor exercise of influence favorable to the Georgia Company at the\r\nnumerous competitive points would work incalculable injury to your\r\nprosperity.... If on the other hand the preponderance of the Georgia\r\nCompany’s interest in this Company should result in a sale to and\r\npurchase by your Company of the Georgia Company stock owned by these\r\ngentlemen, it would necessitate the issue of many millions of your\r\ncommon stock, or some kind of obligation taking precedence of that\r\nstock, the effect of which upon the value of your property you are\r\nfully competent to judge.”[339]\r\n\r\nThe general election of the Terminal was held on May 31, and Mr. Inman\r\nwas elected president for the remainder of the unexpired term.[340]\r\nThe Rice party was apparently overwhelmingly defeated. In reality its\r\nactivity and the presence of its friends in the councils of the victors\r\nresulted in the successful sale of the Georgia Company securities. In\r\nOctober, 1888, little over five months after the directors’ circular\r\nof April 6, the Richmond Terminal took over the Georgia Company stock\r\nat $35 a share and allowed its owners to withdraw successfully from\r\ntheir speculation. Subsequently it also took the Georgia Company bonds\r\nfrom the bankers who had purchased them.[341] This left Inman, Hollins,\r\nand the rest a profit of $60 a share on their original investment. It\r\nmeant for the Richmond Terminal a direct annual loss which there was\r\nvery little prospect of making good. To provide for the $4,000,000\r\nin bonds and the 120,000 shares of stock acquired, this latter issued\r\napproximately $8,200,000 of 5 per cent collateral bonds bearing\r\nan annual interest charge of $410,000. Now both the stock and the\r\n$4,000,000 of bonds were a lien on 40,000 shares of Central of Georgia\r\nstock and depended altogether upon the dividends declared on these by\r\nthe Central Company. The Central never paid over 8 per cent, or a total\r\nof $320,000 on 40,000 shares. The difference between this and $410,000,\r\nor $90,000, constituted a direct loss which the Terminal pledged itself\r\nto meet each year. If the victory of the friends of the company in May\r\nis to be considered a genuine one, one wonders what price the owners of\r\nthe Georgia Company would have charged had the election gone the other\r\nway.\r\n\r\nWith the Central of Georgia, the East Tennessee, and the Richmond\r\n& Danville under its control the Richmond Terminal could look for\r\nstill further extension. In 1890 it acquired control of the Erlanger\r\ngroup of roads from Cincinnati in the north to Chattanooga, thence\r\nto Meridian, Mississippi, thence to Vicksburg, Mississippi, and to\r\nShreveport, Louisiana. At the same time it took in the Louisville\r\nSouthern, which joined Louisville with the Cincinnati lines.[342] In\r\n1888 the Richmond & Danville had concluded a close alliance with the\r\nAtlantic Coast Line,[343] and arrangements had been made for terminal\r\nfacilities at Norfolk.[344] In 1889 it leased the Georgia Pacific, and\r\ntwo years later, when this road reached Arkansas City, it executed a\r\ntraffic agreement with the Missouri Pacific.[345] In 1891 the Georgia\r\nPacific leased the Central Railroad & Banking Company of Georgia\r\nfor ninety-nine years at 7 per cent on its capital stock.[346] This\r\nimmensely improved the connection of the East Tennessee with the\r\nNorth and West, did away with the competition of a parallel line, and\r\nafforded another outlet upon the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was the Richmond Terminal system in 1890. Three great north\r\nand south lines: one from Cincinnati through Birmingham to York, over\r\nthe Erlanger system; one from Bristol through Rome to Selma, over the\r\nEast Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia; and one from Alexandria and West\r\nPoint through Danville, Charlotte, and Atlanta to Montgomery. One of\r\nthese took business from Indiana, Illinois, and the North and Central\r\nWest; one from Baltimore, Philadelphia, and the East; one from both\r\nWest and East; and all three opened upon the Gulf over the Mobile &\r\nBirmingham to Mobile. In addition, three parallel east and west lines:\r\nfrom Chattanooga to Memphis, from Birmingham to Arkansas City, and from\r\nMeridian to Shreveport in Alabama; outlets on the Atlantic coast at\r\nCharleston, Port Royal, Savannah, and Brunswick; and dominance of the\r\nlocal traffic of the whole territory east of Alabama, south of Kentucky\r\nand Tennessee, and north of Florida. It was by all odds the leading\r\nsystem in the South. It had a mileage of 8558.5 as compared with the\r\n2383.4 of the Louisville & Nashville, and gross earnings, exclusive of\r\nthe Erlanger lines, of $41,361,095, or more than twice those of its\r\ngreatest competitor.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, for all its size, the Terminal group was perilously near\r\ncollapse. Its physical condition was poor and much of its mileage was\r\nunprofitable; its capitalization was tainted with dishonesty; and the\r\nlegality of its recent combinations had not been tested in the courts.\r\nLet us quote from the results of an examination made by a well-known\r\nbanking firm three years later.\r\n\r\n“While in a general way the _main lines_ of the Richmond & Danville\r\n[West Point and Alexandria to Atlanta],” said this firm in its report,\r\n“are in fair condition—better than those of the East Tennessee,\r\nexcepting parts of its main line between Bristol and Chattanooga, the\r\nCincinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific, and the Alabama Great Southern—\r\nnearly all the rail in both systems is too light (50 to 60 lbs. while\r\non the main lines it should be 70 to 75 lbs.), many of the trestles\r\nneed renewing, and a large number of the bridges, principally on the\r\nEast Tennessee system, are not sufficiently strong to warrant the\r\nuse of heavy engines, which are essential to hauling long trains and\r\noperating with economy. To a very large extent ballast is altogether\r\nlacking or insufficient in quantity. Excepting that portion of the\r\nequipment represented by equipment bonds or notes, the engines and cars\r\nare generally small and weak and unsuitable for main-line service, and\r\nare also insufficient in quantity for any considerable enlargement of\r\nbusiness. Other appointments, such as shops, yards, etc., are, with but\r\nfew exceptions, crude and uneconomical.\r\n\r\n“On the branches and secondary lines, especially those of the Richmond\r\n& Danville system, the condition is even worse, little or no effort\r\nhaving been made to maintain them at proper standard, even for a\r\nmoderate traffic. About 700 miles of the Richmond & Danville secondary\r\nlines and branches (including about 200 miles of narrow-gauge lines)\r\nare still laid with _iron rails_. On July 1st, 1892, there were 72\r\nmiles of iron rails in the _main_ lines of the East Tennessee.\r\n\r\n“An expenditure of several million dollars should be promptly made on\r\nthese properties for equipment alone, but it is no use to do so, even\r\nif it were possible, unless additional track and yard facilities are\r\nalso provided, nor unless such enlargements of engine and car shops be\r\nmade as will permit of the equipment being kept in order.”[347]\r\n\r\nThis verdict was only reinforced by the characterization in detail of\r\na number of the subsidiary lines. Thus the Columbia & Greenville was\r\ntermed “a collection of weak lines of constantly decreasing value”;\r\nthe Mobile & Birmingham “of no value whatever to the East Tennessee”;\r\nand the Memphis & Charleston “valuable, but in a condition totally\r\nunsuited to modern requirements.” How the capitalization of the system\r\nwas tainted with fraud has already been pointed out. The legality\r\nof the recent combinations had not been tested in the courts. In\r\nJanuary, 1889, counsel for certain unnamed parties had a plea for a\r\n_quo warranto_ presented to the Attorney-General of Virginia.[348]\r\nThe petition alleged that the purchase of the control of the East\r\nTennessee, Virginia & Georgia Railway and of the Virginia Midland was\r\nan abuse of the powers of the Richmond & West Point Terminal ... a\r\nviolation of public policy, and an usurpation to the great damage and\r\nprejudice of the constitution and laws of Virginia. This petition the\r\nAttorney-General dismissed on technical grounds. The legality of the\r\nvarious mergers was soon, however, to be attacked again, and in 1889\r\nthe question was decidedly unsettled.[349]\r\n\r\nThe storm broke in August, 1891. On the eighth of that month the New\r\nYork _Herald_ published a vigorous onslaught upon the company. It\r\nmaintained that the Richmond & Danville system had failed to earn its\r\nfixed charges by $526,560 in the year ending 1890; that this fact had\r\nbeen concealed by deceptive or false entries on the books which made a\r\nfictitious profit emerge by covering up the losses on auxiliary lines;\r\nthat the 8 per cent dividends which had been paid on the Central of\r\nGeorgia had not of late years been earned, and that the price paid for\r\nthe Georgia Central stock had been grossly excessive; that the East\r\nTennessee was just about paying its way; and, finally, that the other\r\nrecent acquisitions were either just paying their way or were showing\r\nannual deficits.[350] Color was given to the charges by the trouble\r\ncaused by the floating debt. Though denied by the officials of the\r\ncompany, the sale of 2000 shares of Baltimore & Ohio stock held in the\r\nTerminal treasury;[351] the negotiation of a short time loan at 6 per\r\ncent and 2½ per cent commission for the Central of Georgia and the\r\nextension of another loan;[352] the placing of $500,000 at 6 per cent\r\nfor the Richmond & Danville; and the active financial support which\r\nGeneral Thomas felt obliged to render the East Tennessee showed the\r\nanxiety which it occasioned.\r\n\r\nOn November 25 the directors held a meeting and appointed Messrs.\r\nEckstein Norton, late president of the Louisville & Nashville; Wm.\r\nSolomon, of Speyer & Co.; Jacob H. Schiff, of Kuhn, Loeb & Co.; Chas.\r\nS. Fairchild, president of the New York Security & Trust Company;\r\nand Louis Fitzgerald, president of the Mercantile Trust Company, a\r\ncommittee to carefully inquire into and examine the condition of the\r\nTerminal properties and to aid the company in perfecting a plan of\r\nreadjustment. Owing to the financial depression, they explained, “the\r\ncompany has been unable to sell securities based upon engagements they\r\nhad made prior to the period of depression and to pay for necessary\r\nequipment and improvements. A large floating debt has in this way been\r\naccumulated, but each of our important railroad systems is solvent....\r\nAfter maturely considering the whole situation, we felt it wise to\r\ninvite the gentlemen whose names appear ... to aid us in perfecting the\r\nbest plan for a permanent adjustment of our affairs.”[353]\r\n\r\nThe committee reported provisionally on December 8. It then stated that\r\nit was essential to the proposed plan of relief that the elections of\r\nall the subordinate companies in the Richmond Terminal system should be\r\npostponed till after the Richmond Terminal affairs were settled, and\r\nrequested that financial provision be made for the employment of an\r\nexpert or experts in the examination of the properties and accounts.\r\nIt was understood that the committee’s plan was to make a considerable\r\nassessment on the stockholders. The board of directors refused to\r\nrespond and the committee therefore withdrew.[354]\r\n\r\nThe next day the stockholders selected Mr. F. P. Olcott to appoint\r\na new committee to take up the work.[355] They were not in favor of\r\nradical action, and Mr. Olcott expressed the opinion that there was no\r\nnecessity for measures so stringent as those which the Schiff-Norton\r\nCommittee had had in mind. It was but natural that at this point there\r\nshould have been some delay. Meetings were held, expedients for raising\r\ncash discussed, and a reorganization plan was gradually whipped into\r\nshape. It was not, therefore, until March 19, 1892, that the public\r\nwere informed what Mr. Olcott and his backers did consider that the\r\nsituation required. The main points of the elaborate scheme which was\r\nthen proposed were as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst, a consolidation of the Richmond Terminal, Richmond & Danville,\r\nand East Tennessee properties. The Central of Georgia and the Erlanger\r\nsystems were not to be included in the reorganization, but the interest\r\nof the Richmond Terminal and the East Tennessee in their stock was to\r\nbe made subject to a new mortgage.\r\n\r\nSecond, a reduction in fixed charges.\r\n\r\nThird, the sale of securities to pay off the floating debt.\r\n\r\nConsolidation of properties was found advisable for several reasons.\r\n“While some of the companies show a surplus of earnings,” said the\r\ncommittee, “in many instances it has been impossible to apply such\r\nsurplus earnings to make up deficiencies arising from the operations\r\nof other companies. The committee finds that the various systems\r\nhave not been operated throughout for the common benefit of the\r\ncontrolling interest, but that they have competed among themselves for\r\nbusiness, each system maintaining separate organizations for obtaining\r\nbusiness.... In the judgment of the committee the only adequate remedy\r\nwhich can be adopted is to unite the several corporations, as far as\r\npracticable, in one system under one management, and to consolidate\r\ntheir obligations.”\r\n\r\nIn order to unify the system the committee proposed three great issues\r\nof new securities as follows:\r\n\r\n$170,000,000 four per cent first mortgage 35-year gold bonds, to be\r\nissued by a new corporation representing the consolidation of the\r\nRichmond & Danville Railroad Company and the Richmond & West Point\r\nTerminal Railway & Warehouse Company.\r\n\r\n$70,000,000 five per cent non-cumulative preferred stock.\r\n\r\n$110,000,000 common stock.\r\n\r\nIn general, the new bonds were to exchange for old bonds and the new\r\ncommon stock for old common and preferred, while the new preferred\r\nstock was to be joined in varying proportions with each of the other\r\nissues to make the exchanges look attractive. Thus, for the Richmond\r\n& Danville consolidated 6s were offered 120 per cent in new bonds and\r\n45 per cent in new preferred; for the East Tennessee first mortgage 7s\r\n120 per cent in new bonds and 45 per cent in new preferred stock; for\r\nthe Richmond Terminal common stock 100 per cent in new common and 50\r\nper cent in new preferred. This arrangement was not rigidly adhered to.\r\nSome of the poorer of the outstanding stocks received new common only,\r\nand the Richmond Terminal preferred was given par in new bonds besides\r\na bonus in preferred. These were, however, exceptions. The principle\r\nwhich determined the various ratios of exchange is more difficult to\r\ndiscover. It was not that of equivalence of return. The plan did not\r\nattempt to allow to each holder a chance at the same receipts which\r\nhe had formerly enjoyed while reducing the amount which he could\r\ndemand, but gave sometimes more than this and sometimes less. And the\r\nvariations from what might be called a normal ratio did not always\r\ncorrespond with the relative security of different issues as indicated\r\nby their market quotations. For instance, the East Tennessee first 7s\r\nsold in December, 1891, at 113½ and the Richmond Terminal collateral\r\n6s at 83; yet the former received 120 per cent and 35 per cent and the\r\nlatter 120 per cent and 40 per cent in new bonds and preferred stock\r\nrespectively. Again, the Atlanta & Charlotte first 7s sold in October,\r\n1891, at 118½ and received under the plan 120 per cent in bonds and 40\r\nper cent in preferred stock; the Richmond & Danville consolidated 6s\r\nsold at 109 and received 120 per cent and 45 per cent. It is clear that\r\nthe committee desired to reduce the interest which the various classes\r\nof bonds should have a right to demand, and that it expected to make\r\ncompensation by means of preferred stock on which payments should be\r\nmade if earned. So much of its scheme was commendable. On the other\r\nhand, the rates of exchange of old securities for new were in many\r\ncases ill-advised. The reduction in fixed charges was to be $1,819,837,\r\nalthough by the exchanges alone the capitalization was to be increased\r\nby over $50,000,000. The charges on the system had amounted in 1891\r\nto $9,474,837.[356] Net earnings had been $8,744,736. Fixed charges\r\nunder the plan were to amount to $7,666,000. As a matter of fact they\r\nwould have been greater than this, for some of the old bonds would have\r\nremained outstanding, and the estimate did not include interest on any\r\nbonds issued for improvements. The floating debt was to be retired by\r\nthe sale of new securities, namely, $18,235,800 new first mortgage\r\nbonds and $6,382,530 preferred stock. These were to net $14,588,640, or\r\nsufficient to cancel a debt of $6,310,000 and car trusts of $2,369,564\r\nand to provide a balance for miscellaneous uses. A syndicate guaranteed\r\nthe sale, but holders of stock or of collateral trust 5 per cent bonds\r\nwere to be allowed to subscribe up to 16 per cent of their holdings\r\nat the rate of $800 for one new mortgage bond and $350 in new stock.\r\nNew bonds to a maximum of $10,000,000 were to be issued only for the\r\nacquisition of additional property, while beyond this the vote of\r\na majority of preferred stock was to be required to authorize any\r\nadditional mortgage on property covered by the first mortgage.[357]\r\n\r\nSuch was the plan laid before securityholders. It proposed a\r\nconsiderable reduction in fixed charges, though probably not enough to\r\nput the company out of danger, and a large increase in new securities.\r\nIt failed because it imposed losses upon the wrong parties. As between\r\nthe various classes of bonds its terms were frequently inequitable. As\r\nbetween the bonds and the stock it altogether favored the latter. It\r\nlevied no assessment, it compelled no subscription to new securities,\r\nand in three cases only did it announce an intention of reducing the\r\nnominal value of the stockholders’ holdings.[358] The original time\r\nlimit for deposits was set at April 14, 1892. This was subsequently\r\nextended, but without effect, and on May 16 the Olcott Committee\r\nannounced that the plan had failed.[359]\r\n\r\nThe collapse of this attempt at readjustment was a blow to those who\r\nhad hoped for a speedy and amicable reorganization of the Richmond\r\nTerminal system. On the same day that failure was confessed the\r\nstockholders met and appointed Messrs. W. E. Strong, Samuel Thomas,\r\nand W. P. Clyde a committee to confer with the Olcott Committee to\r\nascertain what had best be done. A week later General Thomas reported\r\na plan for the reorganization of the Richmond & Danville alone. The\r\nRichmond Terminal Company, he said, should be wound up and be succeeded\r\nby a new company with $43,000,000 of preferred stock and $70,000,000\r\nof common. The present 6 per cent bonds should be given 170 in new\r\npreferred stock; the present 5 per cent bonds and preferred stock par\r\nin new preferred stock; and the present common should receive par in\r\nnew common and be compelled to subscribe for $8,000,000 collateral\r\ntrust two-year 6 per cent notes at 92½.[360] This amounted to an\r\nassessment of 10 per cent upon the common. It was not proposed to pay\r\noff the floating debt with the proceeds of this assessment, but to buy\r\nthe claims held by bankers, and, if necessary, foreclose these claims\r\nand take possession for the stockholders. If the full amount should not\r\nbe subscribed by the stockholders the preferred stock was to have the\r\nright to make subscription for the balance, and to take the securities\r\nthat would have gone to the non-paying common stock; and the common\r\nstock not subscribing was to have no rights to the common stock of the\r\nnew company.[361]\r\n\r\nThat this scheme was much more radical as well as more limited than\r\nthe Olcott plan appears upon its face. No serious attempt was made to\r\ncarry it into effect. On suggestion of General Thomas the stockholders’\r\nmeeting voted that a consulting committee of fifteen be appointed by\r\nthe chair to confer with the committee of three, and then adjourned\r\nsubject to call.[362] The enlarged committee found that application\r\nhad been already made to Messrs. Drexel, Morgan & Co. by a number\r\nof prominent banking firms, asking that they enter upon the work of\r\nreorganization. It therefore dropped the Thomas plan and joined in the\r\npetition. Drexel, Morgan & Co. on their part agreed to undertake an\r\nexamination of the Terminal property,[363] but four weeks later replied\r\nthat while in their opinion a reorganization was feasible, the lack of\r\nassurance of support from Mr. Clyde made them unwilling to undertake\r\nthe task.[364]\r\n\r\nAt this point efforts at reorganization were checked. One plan had\r\nfailed, one had been formulated but not pushed forward, and the task\r\nof creating a third had been refused by the banking firm which was\r\napparently best able to carry a plan to a successful conclusion. For\r\na time now the field was left to the disputes between members of the\r\nRichmond Terminal family, which made up in bitterness for what they\r\nlacked in the matter of valuable result. Mention will be made only of\r\nthe wrangles between the Central of Georgia and the other parts of the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe Central of Georgia had been placed under a receiver of its own\r\nsome two weeks before the publication of the Olcott plan. Some months\r\nlater this receivership was made permanent, and the Richmond Terminal\r\nwas enjoined from voting the 42,200 shares of Central stock which it\r\nheld. It can scarcely be said that the withdrawal of the Central of\r\nGeorgia from the Terminal system was unwelcome to the latter. Already\r\nthe Richmond & Danville had refused to carry out its guarantee on the\r\nCentral’s stock unless that company should deposit bonds to cover an\r\nalleged sum due from it,[365] and President Oakman had hastened to\r\ninform General Alexander, the temporary Central receiver, that the\r\nRichmond & Danville would not operate the Central of Georgia after the\r\nend of the temporary receivership.[366] When, however, the Central not\r\nonly insisted on withdrawal, but asked Judge Speer, of the District\r\nCourt of Macon, Georgia, to appoint a receiver for the Richmond &\r\nDanville Railroad on the ground that that company was insolvent and\r\nwas indebted to the Central in the sum of $2,459,670,[367] prompt\r\naction was made necessary. Application was made to Judge Bond of the\r\nCircuit Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, and on June 16\r\nthis magistrate appointed Messrs. F. W. Huidekoper and Reuben Foster\r\nreceivers of the Danville road.[368]\r\n\r\n“This appointment of receivers by Judge Bond,” explained the parties\r\nresponsible,[369] “is not only not inimical to nor in opposition to\r\nany plan for the financial reorganization and rehabilitation of the\r\nDanville system, but will be found to greatly facilitate and aid\r\nany plan of reorganization, while if the Georgia court had obtained\r\npossession of and jurisdiction over the Danville system this would\r\nhave been rendered practically impossible.... The necessity for such\r\naction,” they continued, with a touch of pathos, “will be further\r\nappreciated when it is known that for some weeks past the Richmond &\r\nDanville Company has not been able to keep either a dollar in bank or\r\nin its safes within the state of Georgia, because every such dollar\r\nhas been attached or garnished by parties alleging claims against the\r\ncompany, and even the money sent by express for the liquidation of\r\npay-rolls has been attached in the hands of the express company, and\r\nin every instance enormous bonds have been required to release such\r\nmoneys....”[370]\r\n\r\nThe temporary securing of their position by the receivership allowed\r\nthe Danville people to hit back at the Central in its weakest point—\r\nthe details of the sale to the Terminal of the Georgia Central Company.\r\nOn August 19 the Advisory Committee of Seventeen of the Terminal\r\nsecurityholders declared that the investigations of their sub-committee\r\nshowed that certain trustees of the company, with their friends, had\r\nprofited to the extent of between three and four million dollars in\r\nthis operation.[371] Toward the end of the year tender of the Georgia\r\nCompany stock and bonds was made back to the original vendors and was\r\nrefused.[372] In December suit was begun to set aside the purchase on\r\nthe ground that there had been no ratification sufficient in law or\r\nequity to bar the stockholders from cancelling the transaction. The\r\nplaintiff charged that “the said combination and plan so formed by and\r\nbetween its president and divers of its directors [referring to the\r\npurchase of the Georgia stock], confederating with the other syndicate\r\ndefendants for the purpose of selling their unsalable and discredited\r\nsecurities to the plaintiff at such prices as yielded them an enormous\r\nprofit and necessarily imposed on plaintiff a heavy yearly loss,\r\nwas contrary to equity and good conscience, and that the pretended\r\ncontract dated October 26, 1888, ... and all the acts done in pretended\r\npurchase of the stocks and bonds of said Georgia Company ... and the\r\ntaking from the assets and money of the plaintiff of over $7,000,000\r\ncash ... to put into the pockets of the said faithless directors, the\r\nsyndicate defendants, and their confederates, were all acts planned\r\n... and performed by said Inman, or under his direction, in the\r\nexecution of such original fraudulent scheme, combination, purpose, and\r\nconfederacy....” And so the plaintiff prayed the court to decree the\r\ncontract of purchase void.[373]\r\n\r\nThese accusations and counter-accusations, justified though many\r\nof them were, had little direct bearing on reorganization. In this\r\nprogress had completely ceased. At the same time some progress was\r\nurgently required. The Richmond Terminal, the Richmond & Danville, and\r\nthe Central of Georgia were in the hands each of a different set of\r\nreceivers, unpaid interest was piling up, and the year 1893 was to show\r\na marked decline in earnings. Necessity and mutual distrust dictated a\r\nsecond appeal to Drexel, Morgan & Co. to undertake the rehabilitation\r\nof the property. On February 2, 1893, the following letter was\r\naddressed to the firm in question:\r\n\r\n    Messrs. Drexel, Morgan & Co.,\r\n\r\n    Gentlemen: Since the time you were previously requested to\r\n    take up the reorganization of the Richmond Terminal system\r\n    much time and thought have been devoted to its affairs, and we\r\n    realize that adverse financial conditions and also the present\r\n    general distrust of all plans for the restoration of this\r\n    system require that, to be successful, its reorganization must\r\n    be undertaken by parties possessing the confidence of both the\r\n    securityholders and the public, and also the financial strength\r\n    sufficient for its accomplishment. We therefore ask you to take\r\n    up this reorganization of the Richmond Terminal and its allied\r\n    properties, each pledging you our personal support and aid in\r\n    full confidence that the securityholders will support us in this\r\n    request.\r\n\r\n    We appreciate the labor and responsibility connected with this\r\n    undertaking, and are therefore willing to do all in our power\r\n    to give you full control of the reorganization, as suggested in\r\n    your letter of June 28,[374] and to advise our friends and the\r\n    securityholders generally to deposit their securities, without\r\n    requiring the assurances customary in such cases.\r\n\r\n        Very respectfully,\r\n            WM. P. CLYDE,\r\n            GEO. F. STONE,\r\n            WM. E. STRONG,\r\n            J. C. MABEN,\r\n            THOMAS F. RYAN.\r\n\r\nThis letter was accompanied by a letter from F. P. Olcott, president\r\nof the Central Trust Company, pledging his support. Inasmuch as lack\r\nof the assurances contained in this correspondence had alone prevented\r\nDrexel, Morgan & Co. from undertaking the task proposed the previous\r\nyear, their prompt though conditional acceptance was not surprising.\r\nA definitive engagement to attempt the work followed on April\r\n12.[375] The enlistment of Drexel, Morgan & Co. in the reorganization\r\nprovoked general satisfaction. Mr. Hollins, of the Central of Georgia\r\nreorganization committee, expressed his pleasure in having responsible\r\nparties to deal with not connected with any past differences.[376] The\r\ndirectors of the Richmond Terminal urged all classes of securityholders\r\nto deposit, and the Clyde Committee was emphatic in its recommendation.\r\nIt was recognized that the situation was the most favorable which could\r\nbe hoped for. No group of Southern railroad financiers seemed capable\r\nof producing a fair reorganization plan, and it was also probable\r\nthat no plan from such a source, however fair, would have received a\r\nsympathetic welcome. Drexel, Morgan & Co., on the other hand, were both\r\ncapable and sure of a hearing.\r\n\r\nThere was remarkably little delay in making public the Drexel-Morgan\r\nplan. Less than three weeks after their final acceptance of\r\nresponsibility, though about three months after the correspondence of\r\nFebruary 2, the firm published a comprehensive plan, to the examination\r\nof which the next few pages may be devoted. The principles of this plan\r\nof May 1, 1893, were simple, and were clearly and convincingly set\r\nforth. The property to be considered was to be that of the Richmond\r\nTerminal, the Richmond & Danville, and the East Tennessee. The Central\r\nof Georgia was to be omitted. The imperative needs of these properties\r\nthe plan declared to be two:\r\n\r\nFirst, the provision of a large sum for the physical improvement of the\r\nsystem;\r\n\r\nSecond, the reduction of fixed charges to an amount which the companies\r\ncould earn.[377]\r\n\r\nThe physical condition of the above roads in 1893 was extremely bad.\r\n“One obvious trouble ... is,” said the plan, “that their maintenance\r\nand repairs have been neglected. Another is that, while nearly all\r\nthe lines in the United States have been steadily substituting solid\r\nroadbeds, heavy equipment, and other modern facilities for the light\r\nand ineffective appliances formerly in use, these lines, because of the\r\nconstant drain to which they were subject for the obligations assumed,\r\nand from the necessities of the Terminal Company for the payment to\r\nit, as dividends, of every available dollar with which to meet its\r\nown obligations, have not been in a financial condition to keep up to\r\nthe times in this respect, and now they find themselves so far behind\r\nas to be, to a considerable extent, unqualified to handle business\r\nwith economy, or to compete successfully with other lines.”[378] The\r\nfinancial condition was little better. The absolute fixed charges of\r\nthe Richmond Terminal, the Richmond & Danville, and the East Tennessee\r\nsystems, viz., interest on bonds held by the public, rentals, equipment\r\nnotes, and sinking funds, and interest on floating debts, receivers’\r\ncertificates, etc., the plan declared to amount annually to about\r\n$9,900,000. The entire net earnings for the fiscal year ending June\r\n30, 1893, were estimated at $7,000,000. The result was a deficit for\r\nthe year of about $2,900,000. This state of affairs required serious\r\nsacrifices from somebody. The Olcott plan had illustrated the folly of\r\nlaying the burden largely on well-secured senior bonds. The Drexel plan\r\nproposed to demand the necessary concessions from the junior bonds and\r\nfrom the stock. “About $74,000,000 of the bonds and guaranteed stocks\r\nof the Richmond & Danville and the East Tennessee systems held by the\r\npublic,” it continued, “are on properties which are believed for the\r\nmost part to afford adequate security, and for this or other reasons\r\nthis plan has not sought to disturb them. About $50,000,000 (mostly\r\nrecent issues) are junior liens, inadequately secured, or else are on\r\nnew or branch lines of uncertain earning capacity, and the holders,\r\nin self-preservation, must make such reasonable concessions as the\r\nsituation necessitates, taking compensation therefor in preferred or\r\ncommon stock of the new company....”\r\n\r\nThe tools of the reorganization were to be the following new issues:\r\n\r\n$140,000,000 first consolidated mortgage and collateral trust 100-year\r\n5 per cent bonds, secured by mortgage and pledge of all the property of\r\nthe new company. This total might be subsequently increased to acquire\r\nthe whole or part of the Georgia Central system, or to acquire the\r\nownership of the Cincinnati Southern Railway or any other line as a\r\nsubstitute therefor.\r\n\r\n$75,000,000 5 per cent non-cumulative preferred stock.\r\n\r\n$160,000,000 common stock.\r\n\r\n“The general theory of adjustment of disturbed bonds,” said the plan,\r\n“is to substitute for them the new 5 per cent bonds to such an extent\r\nas is warranted by earnings and situation of the properties covered by\r\nthe present mortgages, and the new preferred stock for the remainder of\r\nthe principal. In some cases, where the bonds are on properties of no\r\nactual and little prospective earning capacity, a more severe reduction\r\nis necessary. In several instances, where the bonds are on properties\r\nwhich are likely to improve more rapidly than other disturbed parts of\r\nthe system, this fact is recognized, and an extra allowance is made\r\nin compensation. Finally, in one or two cases, where the bonds are on\r\nproperties the loss of which would adversely affect the rest of the\r\nsystem, a proper recognition is made of this fact.” In practice not\r\nonly bonds and preferred stock, but preferred and common stock, or even\r\ncommon stock alone were exchanged for old securities of little value.\r\n\r\nThis provided for old securities but not for cash requirements. To\r\nraise cash three devices were resorted to, all of which bore entirely\r\non the junior securityholders or on the stock. The most direct was the\r\nlevying of an assessment. Terminal common stock was assessed $12.50\r\nper share, East Tennessee first preferred $3, second preferred $6,\r\nand common stock $9; new preferred stock being in each case given in\r\nreturn. This distribution was based on the idea that the stockholders\r\nof each railroad should provide for its floating debt. The floating\r\ndebt of the Richmond & Danville was about $7,000,000, that of the\r\nEast Tennessee about $3,000,000, and that of the Richmond Terminal\r\nabout $100,000. But since the last named held practically all of the\r\nRichmond stock and a considerable proportion of the East Tennessee,\r\nits stockholders were saddled with a total of $8,300,000 or an\r\nequivalent of $12.50 per share, while the East Tennessee was taxed\r\nproportionately. The rest of the cash requirements were covered by the\r\nsale of $8,000,000 new bonds at 85, and $33,333,000 new common stock at\r\n15. Depositors of all classes of Terminal securities and of all classes\r\nof readjusted securities of the other systems were allowed to subscribe\r\nto the extent of $1000 in a new bond and $4000 in new stock trust\r\ncertificates for each $22,000 par value of stocks or bonds deposited.\r\nThe balance of the issues was looked after by an underwriting\r\nsyndicate.[379]\r\n\r\nFuture capital requirements were provided for mainly by new bonds.\r\n$35,383,000 in new 5 per cents were set aside to be used only for new\r\nconstruction, betterments, purchase of rolling stock, and extensions\r\nand additions to the system. Not over $2,500,000 of these were to be\r\nused in any one calendar year; except that, in addition to this annual\r\nappropriation, a total of $3,000,000 in bonds might be specifically\r\nappropriated with the unanimous consent of the stock trustees, for\r\nthe building of branches or extensions, if undertaken within three\r\nyears after the creation of the new mortgage. All property acquired\r\nwith these bonds was to be brought under the lien of the new mortgage.\r\n$8,000,000 of the cash raised by assessment and sale of securities,\r\nmoreover, were to be available for new construction and equipment on\r\nthe Richmond & Danville and the East Tennessee. And, finally, there was\r\nprovision for the limitation of new bond issues, for a voting trust and\r\nfor the consolidation of the Terminal system.\r\n\r\n“The ultimate object of the reorganization,” said the plan “(excluding\r\nthe Georgia Central Company from consideration), is to have the new\r\ncompany acquire, so far as practicable, the ownership of the Richmond &\r\nDanville and East Tennessee systems, including the various securities\r\nnow owned by the Terminal Company ... and the securities pledged for\r\nthe Richmond & Danville and East Tennessee floating debt....\r\n\r\n“Both classes of stock of the new company ... are to be issued to\r\nthree Stock Trustees, who shall be appointed, on or before completion\r\nof reorganization, by Messrs. Drexel, Morgan & Co. The stock shall be\r\nheld by the Stock Trustees and their successors, jointly, for five\r\nyears, and for such further period (if any) as shall elapse before the\r\npreferred stock shall have paid 5 per cent cash dividend in one year,\r\nalthough the Stock Trustees may, in their discretion, deliver the stock\r\nat an earlier date....\r\n\r\n“No additional mortgage shall be put upon the property to be acquired\r\nhereunder by the new company, nor shall the authorized amount of the\r\npreferred stock be increased without the consent in each case of the\r\nmajority in amount of the preferred stockholders.”[380]\r\n\r\nThe result of all these provisions was to be a cancellation of the\r\nfloating debt, a reduction in fixed charges, and a decrease in mortgage\r\nbonds; though inevitably also an increase in stock outstanding.\r\nThe plan proposed to disturb $49,117,900 of outstanding bonds, or,\r\nincluding the Richmond Terminal 5s and 6s, a total of $65,617,900. But\r\nthe new bonds which it offered in exchange amounted to $19,806,700\r\nonly. On the other hand it took $111,819,550 in stock from the hands\r\nof the public, and offered $165,559,514 new stock in the course of\r\nthe exchanges.[381] This was very conservative, since the increase\r\nin total capitalization through these exchanges was less than 4½ per\r\ncent; and less too than the cash assessment for which preferred stock\r\nwas allowed. Somewhat greater increase in securities appears if we\r\nconsider, not only the exchanges, but the provisions of the plan as\r\na whole; for here we must include $33,300,000 new common stock and\r\n$8,000,000 new bonds issued to retire in part the $12,900,000 of\r\nfloating debt and for other purposes. Even so the net increase was\r\nonly 6 per cent.[382] The natural result was a considerable reduction\r\nin fixed charges. The absolute fixed charges of the system in 1893 the\r\nplan stated to be $9,900,000. The fixed charges under the plan were to\r\nbe $6,789,000. This was certainly a step in the right direction. It was\r\nthe point, nevertheless, at which the plan was weakest. The clauses\r\nwhich have been outlined made abundant and conservative provision\r\nfor cash requirements; and the sums which they allowed for future\r\ndevelopment were not on their face inadequate; but the reduction in\r\nfixed charges was less than should have been ensured. The net earnings\r\nfor the year ending June 30, 1892, were $7,725,000, and those for 1893\r\nwere estimated by the plan itself as not likely to exceed $7,000,000.\r\nThis would have left $936,000 over the proposed fixed charges in 1892\r\nand $211,000 in 1893:—or a surplus of some 3 per cent in the latter\r\nyear. This was altogether insufficient. It not only put out of the\r\nquestion dividends on the $200,000,000 of stock, but it precluded the\r\npartial improvement of the road from earnings, and left the system at\r\nthe mercy of the slightest decrease in the annual returns. Compared\r\nwith previous fixed charges the plan proposed noteworthy reductions;\r\ncompared with the earnings of the lines involved it did not go far\r\nenough.[383]\r\n\r\nThe reception of the Drexel-Morgan plan was, nevertheless,\r\nsatisfactory. Certain concessions were made to various classes of\r\nbonds, and by June 17, over 95 per cent of the securityholders had\r\ngiven their assent.[384] Unfortunately the earnings of the property\r\nnow steadily decreased. The gross receipts of the Richmond & Danville\r\nproper were 15 per cent less in 1893 than in 1892; and Terminal system\r\nlines which had earned $6,100,000 in 1892 earned $5,300,000 in 1893,\r\nand promised to earn some $4,250,000 only in 1894. This decrease\r\nwas common to the country at large. It was of peculiar importance,\r\nhowever, in emphasizing the weak point in the Drexel plan. From January\r\n1 to July 1, 1893, the Terminal floating debt, exclusive of car trusts,\r\nincreased $2,600,000. From July 1 to March 1 it increased at least\r\na million more. The reorganization plan had been prepared “on the\r\nassumption that, during reorganization, the receivers of the various\r\nproperties could provide for the interest charges on the undisturbed\r\nsecurities, as well as accumulate a sum sufficient for the interest\r\naccruing on the ‘disturbed securities’ as readjusted.”[385] As it\r\nturned out, the receivers were obliged to make many defaults among\r\nthe undisturbed securities, and saved nothing for the disturbed. Some\r\nmodification of the published plan had perforce to be arranged.\r\n\r\nThese modifications were detailed in a pamphlet dated February 20,\r\n1894. They comprised three proposals:\r\n\r\n(1) To exclude from the reorganization certain unprofitable properties\r\nwhich had previously been included. Certain alterations had already\r\nbeen made toward this end in the exclusion of the Erlanger line, the\r\nMemphis & Charleston, and the Mobile & Birmingham. Further modification\r\nwas to exclude the Northeastern Railroad of Georgia, the Macon &\r\nNorthern, and five other subsidiary lines.\r\n\r\n(2) To fund for a year or two the coupons on new bonds given for\r\ncertain securities, and to provide in other cases that the new bonds\r\nshould not bear interest till 1895 or 1896.\r\n\r\n(3) To lighten the assessment on Richmond Terminal and East Tennessee\r\ncommon stock, and to allow to all assessed securities one-quarter of\r\ntheir assessment in bonds and three-quarters in preferred stock instead\r\nof all in preferred stock.\r\n\r\nAt the same time a few other modifications allowed to some bonds a\r\nmore liberal grant of new securities than they had obtained in May.\r\nIt was hoped by these means to raise the average earning ability of\r\nthe system, while reducing the new securities to be issued.[386]\r\nThe temporary funding of coupons further lightened fixed charges\r\nuntil business should have had time to revive. “Under the plan as now\r\nmodified,” stated Drexel, Morgan & Co., “and assuming that one-half of\r\nthe new bonds to be sold are used in 1894 and the other half in 1895,\r\nthe fixed charges are estimated at about\r\n\r\n  $4,100,000 in 1894,\r\n   4,700,000 in 1895,\r\n   5,400,000 in 1896.[387]\r\n\r\n“The depression in the South began in 1890–91. There would appear to\r\nbe no reason why in a comparatively short time these properties should\r\nnot very easily earn, _gross_, as much as and more than they earned in\r\nthat fiscal year, viz., over $21,000,000. Operated at 70 per cent ...\r\nthere would remain, say $6,600,000 net against an interest charge of\r\n$5,400,000.”[387]\r\n\r\nThe reduction in assessments was made possible by the decrease in\r\nmileage. Although the floating debt had increased $2,600,000 from\r\nJanuary 1, 1893, and the equipment notes recorded were greater by\r\n$1,048,000,[388] yet the debt to be provided for by the modified plan\r\nof 1894 was estimated at only $12,200,000. Besides this the cash to be\r\nreserved for new construction was reduced $3,000,000, and the surplus\r\nfor expenses and contingencies $1,380,000. Assessments were therefore\r\nset at $10 a share on Richmond Terminal common instead of $12.50; $7.20\r\non East Tennessee common instead of $9; and $3 and $6 on East Tennessee\r\nfirst and second preferred as before. The new securities to be sold\r\nwere reduced correspondingly to $8,000,000 of bonds and $25,000,000\r\nof common stock. Finally, the bonds to provide for new construction,\r\nbetterments, and additions were reduced from $35,383,000 to about\r\n$19,000,000, of which not over $2,000,000 (instead of $2,500,000) were\r\nto be used in any calendar year. Other provisions of the earlier plan\r\nwere to remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nIt was this modified plan which was carried to a successful conclusion.\r\nIn principle it did not mend the weak spot in its predecessor of\r\nMay. That plan had contemplated a surplus of $211,000 over fixed\r\ncharges for 1893. This estimated charges at $4,100,000 for 1894 and\r\nnet earnings at $4,250,000 on a somewhat reduced mileage. There was\r\nnot to be more left for dividends and improvements than there had\r\nbeen before, while the cash and bond provisions for improvements\r\nwere notably reduced. The concession of bonds to stockholders for\r\none-quarter of their assessments was unsound financiering, as was,\r\non the whole, the funding of coupons on the new mortgage bonds. The\r\nsuccess which the modification had, nevertheless, in restoring the\r\ncompany to solvency, was due to the improvement in earnings which soon\r\ntook place. The original plan had based its calculations on the first\r\nyear of depression; the amended plan kept charges down till three years\r\nhad elapsed. By that time business had begun to mend, and all danger\r\nof bankruptcy was past. Other points in either plan leave little to\r\ncriticise.\r\n\r\nThe modifications to the original plan were issued on February 20,\r\n1894. Over 75 per cent of the system bonds had assented by March 24.\r\nAt one foreclosure sale after another the reorganization committee now\r\nbought in the portions of the old system covered by the plan. Suits\r\nagainst the Richmond Terminal had been brought under the two collateral\r\nmortgages, and on July 13, 1893, the reorganization committee bid in\r\nthe pledged securities. On February 6, 1894, it bought the remaining\r\nassets of the Terminal Company; on June 15 it bought the Richmond &\r\nDanville, and on July 7 the East Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia. Two\r\ntrustees’ sales, one receivers’ sale, ten foreclosure sales, and six\r\nconveyances without foreclosure had occurred by September, 1894, and\r\nmore minor sales were in progress.[389] On June 15 the Southern Railway\r\nCompany was organized with a charter from the state of Virginia, and\r\ntook over in succession properties to the extent of 4607 miles.[390]\r\nSamuel Spencer was elected president. Some thirty corporations were\r\nswept away and thirty boards of directors abolished; for the Southern\r\nRailway was an operating company, and, unlike the Richmond Terminal\r\nand the Richmond & Danville, controlled but an inappreciable fraction\r\nof its mileage through the ownership of stock. The new securities\r\nwere issued at the proper times, and according to the plan the common\r\nand preferred stock was turned over to three voting trustees,[391] who\r\nissued trust certificates in their stead.\r\n\r\nThis completed the reorganization of the Richmond Terminal Company so\r\nfar as the principal part of its mileage was concerned. The portions\r\nof the system excluded from the plan have been to some extent bought\r\nback in later years. Control of the Alabama Great Southern was bought\r\nin 1895; the Memphis & Charleston was acquired in 1898; the Richmond\r\n& Mecklenburg was leased in 1898 and the Mobile & Birmingham in 1899;\r\nand the Northeastern of Georgia was bought in 1899. The system has\r\nnot yet, however, fully regained its old position. The most important\r\nloss has undoubtedly been that of the Central of Georgia. We left this\r\ncompany engaged in active disputes with the Terminal management. During\r\n1892 and 1893 efforts to reorganize it were made under the leadership\r\nof Hollins & Co. The principal difficulties were the large floating\r\ndebt and the money required to put the property into good physical\r\ncondition.[392] A plan was actually prepared at the beginning of 1893\r\nand submitted to securityholders, but failed because of that same\r\ndecline in earnings which had caused the modification of the Terminal\r\nreorganization plan. A second plan, prepared in 1894, had a better\r\nfate,[393] and in modified form was put into effect. The _Railroad_ was\r\nsold at auction in 1895, the Central of Georgia _Railway_ was organized\r\nto take its place,[394] and the corporation entered upon a new career\r\nwhich we have not space to follow.[395]\r\n\r\nAs for the Southern Railway, the years from 1895 to 1907 have brought\r\nit prosperity. It has extended considerably in mileage. Besides\r\nreacquiring lines which formerly were part of the Richmond Terminal\r\nsystem, it has grown south to Jacksonville and Palatka, east to\r\nCharleston and to a more direct connection with Norfolk, and west from\r\nLouisville to East St. Louis. It has further joined its Louisville-East\r\nSt. Louis line to Chicago by acquiring a half-interest in the Monon,\r\nand to the rest of its system by a half-interest in the Cincinnati,\r\nNew Orleans & Texas Pacific; and it has bought control of the Mobile\r\n& Ohio, which stretches through four states from East St. Louis to\r\nMobile. Instead of 4392 miles as operated on June 30, 1895, it now\r\nreports 7546. The earnings of the system have increased more rapidly\r\nthan its mileage. The revival of business after 1897 occurred with\r\nsingular force in the South, and seems to have introduced there a new\r\nindustrial era. As a result, the Southern’s gross earnings have trebled\r\nand its net earnings have been multiplied by two. Passenger receipts,\r\nwhich were $4,329,499 in 1895, have become $14,683,006 in 1907. Freight\r\nreceipts have increased from $10,816,024 to $37,368,095.\r\n\r\nIt has been this increase in earnings which has at last allowed some\r\nof that margin for improvements which the reorganization plans weakly\r\nattempted to secure. And accordingly, large sums have been expended.\r\nMaintenance of way charges are now over $1000 per mile instead of\r\n$630. Expenses per locomotive mile have increased from 4.19 cents in\r\n1895 to 7.54 cents in 1907; expenses per passenger car mile from .83\r\nto 1.03 cents; and expenses per freight car mile from .47 to 2.18\r\ncents. It is true that locomotives and cars are larger to-day and\r\nthat rails are heavier, but this fact is far from accounting for the\r\ndifference. Not only has the existing plant been kept in good repair\r\nfrom earnings alone, but distinct improvements have been made. New\r\nrail has been laid, additional ballast put in, wooden trestles filled\r\nor replaced with steel. It was estimated in 1906 that $5,000,000 had\r\nbeen spent in betterments and charged against income up to that time,\r\nbesides some $15,000,000 more paid for equipment out of earnings.\r\nMeanwhile considerable sums had been spent from capital account. The\r\nreorganization plan allowed for some $19,000,000 of new bonds to be\r\nsold at the rate of $2,000,000 per year.[396] Of these the company had\r\nsold $13,000,000 for improvement of the property by February 1, 1906,\r\nbesides disposing of some $23,000,000 of equipment obligations.\r\n\r\nThe appreciation of the need for still more liberal expenditure led\r\nin 1906 to a comprehensive plan for the issue of new capital. Under\r\ndate of February 1, the company submitted to its voting trustees[397]\r\na scheme for a $200,000,000 mortgage, of which $15,000,000 were to\r\nbe issued at once and the rest were to be reserved. Of the immediate\r\nissue $4,962,774 were to refund payments for equipment hitherto made\r\nand charged to capital; $3,501,000 were to refund investments in\r\nsecurities of, and advances to, subordinate companies, as well as\r\nto be used for the acquisition of property not heretofore funded;\r\nand $6,536,226 were for double track, revision of grades, new yards,\r\nshops, etc. Of the securities reserved, $65,164,000 were for refunding\r\npurposes: $20,000,000 for certain subsidiary lines: and $99,834,000\r\nto go, first, for betterments and improvements on the entire system\r\nand for new equipment in amounts not exceeding $5,000,000 in each\r\nyear; and second, in exchange for first mortgage bonds not exceeding\r\nin amount the actual cost of railroads and terminals hereafter to be\r\nacquired. In other words, about one-half of the total issue is to go,\r\nsooner or later, for improvements, and the rest for refundings and for\r\nnew acquisitions.[398] It was believed that the Southern could readily\r\npay the interest on the increased immediate issue without endangering\r\ndividends on its preferred stock, and that the subsequent increases\r\nin earnings would more than provide for whatever additions to charges\r\nmight occur. Negotiations for the placing of the new securities were\r\nconcluded with J. P. Morgan & Co. at a reported price of 96½.\r\n\r\nThe results of the expenditures for improvements have been remarkable.\r\nIn 1895 the Southern Railway had in use 623 locomotives; in 1907 the\r\nnumber was 1536. In the former year there were 487 passenger cars and\r\n18,924 freight cars; in the latter there were respectively 995 and\r\n56,225.[399] Only 370 miles of track in 1895 were over 65 pounds in\r\nweight per yard; more than 3100 surpassed that limit in 1907. It is\r\nnevertheless in its inability to handle the business offered it that\r\nthe Southern has provoked sharpest criticism. Over 3600 miles of its\r\nsystem still have rails weighing 62 pounds or less to the yard;—that\r\nis, rails incapable of meeting modern operating conditions. Only 206\r\nmiles of double and 1981 of side track exist. Equipment appears to\r\nbe still inadequate. Signals are imperfect, and speed and promptness\r\nseemingly impossible to attain. The late tragic death of Mr. Spencer\r\nwas a forcible illustration of the deficiencies of the road which he\r\nhad done so much to improve.\r\n\r\nThe earning power of the system cannot yet, therefore, be said to be\r\nsecure. Moreover, the capitalization of almost $72,000 per mile,[400]\r\nas well as the less dense railroad business in the South, the slight\r\nconstruction of many of the Southern Railway lines, the lack of\r\nadequate facilities which compels an operating ratio of 76 per cent,\r\nand the absorption of minor roads less prosperous than the main stem,—\r\nall these factors have kept down the net surplus from operation. On\r\nthe other hand, the management is making an earnest attempt to raise\r\nthe standard of the property. Bonds and notes to the par value of over\r\n$32,000,000 have been sold to provide for additions and improvements\r\nduring the past year, and a very great change for the better has taken\r\nplace. Dividends on the preferred stock have been paid since 1897. As\r\nthe country develops, and as the sums spent upon improvements come more\r\nand more to have their effects, a dividend upon the common stock will\r\nbe paid. The near future is more likely to witness the cessation of\r\ndividends upon the preferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nATCHISON, TOPEKA & SANTA FE\r\n\r\n  Charter—Strategic extensions—Competitive extensions—Effect\r\n    on finances—Raise in rate of dividend—Reorganization of\r\n    1889—Acquisition of the St. Louis & San Francisco and of the\r\n    Colorado Midland—Income bond conversion—Receivership—English\r\n    reorganization plan—Mr. Little’s report—Final reorganization plan\r\n    —Sale—Subsequent history.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad has been reorganized twice, in\r\n1889 and in 1893–5; the first time without, but the second time after\r\na foreclosure sale. The keynote of its history has been extension. It\r\nwas the enterprise of the men in control before 1889 which gave it the\r\nposition and power it holds to-day, but it was also that enterprise\r\nwhich necessitated its first reorganization by imposing upon it heavier\r\nburdens than it could bear.\r\n\r\nChartered in Kansas in 1863, the Atchison spread west, southwest,\r\nsouth, and northeast. It received some aid from the state of Kansas in\r\nthe shape of a grant of lands, but depended primarily on the investment\r\nof private capital. Kansas itself was not, in 1870, a very encouraging\r\nfield for railroad building. It had been admitted as a state only in\r\n1861, and could boast for the most part of less than two inhabitants\r\nto the square mile;—although settlement was pushing westward with\r\nconsiderable rapidity, and stores of mineral wealth had been discovered\r\nin Colorado. The railroad in those days had to create its own traffic,\r\nand population followed the means of transportation. The peculiarity of\r\nKansas was a central position, which lent itself to schemes of the most\r\nfar-reaching nature. A railroad reaching from one end of the state to\r\nthe other might almost equally well have been extended to California,\r\nto Chicago, or to the Gulf; and could be sure in time, if it survived,\r\nof the carriage of a vast volume of traffic out in every direction\r\nfrom the Central West. The Atchison managers saw this opportunity, and\r\ncourageously and persistently endeavored to realize it;—part of the\r\nproject they announced, and part they kept back till the fitting time\r\nshould come.\r\n\r\nThe systematic extension of the Atchison Railroad may be divided into\r\nfour parts:\r\n\r\n(1) The construction through Kansas to Colorado, to save the charter,\r\nthen down the valley of the Rio Grande to Albuquerque.\r\n\r\n(2) The securing of a connection with the Pacific Coast by\r\nconstruction, lease, or traffic agreement.\r\n\r\n(3) The connection with the Gulf.\r\n\r\n(4) The connection with Chicago.\r\n\r\nAs the system neared completion, and its territory came to be invaded\r\nby other roads, there were added to this systematic extension what\r\nmay be called competitive extensions, consisting largely in the\r\nconstruction of branch lines, and multiplied beyond anything which the\r\ncountry could need for years to come. This sort of building was most\r\nprominent from 1884 to 1888 and will be considered in its place.\r\n\r\nThe first stretch of road was built with few difficulties or\r\ncomplications. It was commenced in 1869, and, after numerous delays, it\r\nreached the western border of the state of Kansas on December 28 of the\r\nsame year; from this point it went on more leisurely, first west and\r\nthen southwest, to Albuquerque.[401] These early miles were paid for\r\nfrom the proceeds of both stocks and bonds. From Albuquerque a variety\r\nof routes presented themselves. The Southern Pacific had by that time\r\nbuilt to El Paso, and it was feasible to extend the Atchison to that\r\npoint and to rely on a traffic agreement for the handling of the\r\nwestern business. Or, building to Deming near El Paso, Atchison might\r\nhave extended its line down the river valleys in the northwestern part\r\nof Mexico to Guaymas on the Gulf of California. Or, Atchison might have\r\nbuilt directly west from Albuquerque. All three of these routes were\r\nconsidered, and all three were eventually carried out.[402]\r\n\r\nThe connection with the Southern Pacific was not a very difficult\r\none to make, and the Atchison reached Deming in March, 1881. By the\r\ntraffic agreement then concluded the Atchison secured the use of the\r\nSouthern Pacific tracks from Deming to Benson, Arizona, and arranged\r\nto build south into Mexico from this point; while the Southern Pacific\r\nwas allotted 51 per cent of the through rate on traffic passing over\r\nSouthern Pacific lines.[403] This formed the second through route\r\nfrom the East, and in September, 1881, it took one-quarter as much\r\nbusiness as the Central Pacific. It was also the first of Atchison’s\r\nprojected routes to be completed. The line to Guaymas was added by\r\npurchase. Instead of building, Atchison exchanged its stock for the\r\nstock of the already existing Sonora Railroad in the proportion of one\r\nto two, and guaranteed the interest on the Sonora first mortgage 7\r\nper cent bonds.[404] This made up for the lack of an independent line\r\nto the coast further north. The total of Sonora stock was $5,400,000,\r\nrequiring $2,700,000 Atchison stock in exchange. The total first\r\nmortgage 7 per cent bond issue was $4,050,000. With the railroad came\r\na subsidy of $2,608,200 (American gold), equal to $11,270 (Mexican)\r\nper mile. This subsidy kept cropping up in Atchison finance for some\r\ntime, and was finally adjusted in 1896 by the transfer to the company\r\nof $1,159,800 in 3 per cent bonds of the Mexican Interior Consolidated\r\nDebt.\r\n\r\nFor the direct route President Strong sought the help of the St. Louis\r\n& San Francisco, and the use of the charter of the Atlantic & Pacific\r\nwhich it owned. The Atlantic & Pacific was a road incorporated in 1886,\r\nwith a charter to build from St. Louis to California. In spite both of\r\nits charter and of its name it had never gone further west than Vinita,\r\nin the northeast corner of Indian Territory.[405] President Strong and\r\nthe Frisco now agreed to continue construction under the name of the\r\nAtlantic & Pacific, both from Vinita and from Albuquerque. The Atchison\r\nwas to be given a half-interest in the charter, directors were to be\r\nchosen equally from the two companies, and the cost was to be met by a\r\n$25,000,000 loan, which the Atchison and the Frisco were to guarantee\r\njointly but not severally.[406] Before the new construction neared\r\ncompletion, however, the St. Louis & San Francisco fell under the\r\ncontrol of Messrs. Gould and Huntington, who, as owners of the Texas &\r\nPacific and the Southern Pacific respectively, naturally disapproved of\r\nthe plan to extend the Atlantic & Pacific to the coast. The Atchison,\r\ntherefore, agreed to build no further west than the Colorado River. At\r\nthat point the Southern Pacific was to meet it with a line from Mojave.\r\nThe Southern Pacific gave to the Atlantic & Pacific an interest\r\nguarantee on its bonds to the extent of 25 per cent of the gross\r\nearnings derived from Atlantic & Pacific through business, and the\r\nlatter road retained all its rights for a line in California.[407] This\r\nproved unprofitable, for the Southern Pacific persistently diverted\r\ntraffic to Ogden and El Paso, and in 1884 still another arrangement was\r\nmade. By this—\r\n\r\n(_a_) The Atlantic & Pacific bought the Southern Pacific division\r\nbetween the Needles (the Colorado River) and Mojave, 242 miles, for\r\n$30,000 per mile, and, until such time as title could be given by the\r\ndischarge of the mortgage upon it, took a lease at an annual rental of\r\n6 per cent on the purchase price.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The Atlantic & Pacific secured trackage and traffic rights and\r\nfacilities between Mojave and Oakland and San Francisco, as well as the\r\nuse of terminals at the latter point.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The Atchison (and the St. Louis & San Francisco likewise) agreed\r\nto buy from the Pacific Improvement Company first mortgage bonds\r\nand other securities of the Atlantic & Pacific of the par value of\r\n$3,096,768, at the actual cost to the Improvement Company, to wit,\r\n$1,524,356.\r\n\r\nTo complete the connection to the coast the Atchison built from\r\nWaterman, some seventy miles east of Mojave on the Atlantic & Pacific,\r\nto Colton on the Southern Pacific, and secured control of the\r\nCalifornia Southern from Colton to San Diego.[408] In 1885 entrance was\r\nobtained to Los Angeles by lease of the Southern Pacific track between\r\nColton and that city.[409]\r\n\r\nThe money for this rapid progress was obtained by the sale of both\r\nstocks and bonds, but on the whole stock predominated. The directors\r\nrightly considered it much more conservative to issue stock and sell\r\nit at par than to load the road down with a heavy debt in the shape of\r\nbonds; and what is more, they were able to make good their word, and to\r\nsell stock at or near par in spite of the risk incident to operations\r\nsuch as the Atchison was conducting and the frequent bonuses or stock\r\ndividends declared.\r\n\r\nBy 1884, then, Atchison had reached the Pacific coast. The next great\r\nsteps were the extensions to Galveston and to Chicago. The year\r\nof entrance to Los Angeles the Atchison did not cross the southern\r\nboundary of Kansas. Certain of its stockholders were, however,\r\nunofficially interested in the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe, which ran\r\nfrom Galveston on the south to the Indian Territory on the north,\r\nroughly 200 miles. In 1884 a charter was obtained for the Southern\r\nKansas Railway Company, a corporation organized solely to build south\r\nfrom Arkansas City. The same year the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe\r\nobtained permission to stretch north. The two roads met at Purcell in\r\nthe summer of 1887.[410] In 1886 the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe was\r\nformally brought in. Gulf stock then amounted to $4,560,000 and bonds\r\nhad been issued to a limit of $17,000 per mile. For the entire capital\r\nstock, subject to the above encumbrance, Atchison agreed to pay $8000 a\r\nmile in Atchison stock, par value.[411] The final move was to get into\r\nChicago. “The Atchison Company has been much too conservative during\r\nthe last few years,” said the _Chronicle_, “and thus has allowed its\r\nterritory to be invaded.” The first intent was to build direct. There\r\nwere incorporated, in Illinois the Chicago, Santa Fe & California\r\nRailway Company, and in Iowa the Chicago, Santa Fe & California Railway\r\nCompany of Iowa. In 1887 the Atchison was able to purchase the Chicago\r\n& St. Louis Railroad, between Chicago and Streator, with a branch to\r\nPekin,[412] and to save itself construction between these points. The\r\nwhole line was opened for traffic in May, 1888.[413]\r\n\r\nThis completed Atchison’s systematic extensions before 1889. From a\r\nlocal road in Kansas it had become a through route, taking freight\r\nover its own rails from Chicago to Galveston and to the Pacific coast.\r\nBut especially in the latter eighties competition had become keen; and\r\nto its strategic extensions Atchison was obliged to add competitive\r\nbuilding on an enormous scale. Of the 7000 miles in 1888, over 2700\r\nhad been added since January, 1886, and had been built, not to tap new\r\nsources of traffic, but to defend what was thought to be Atchison’s\r\nrightful territory by means of a desperate war of rates. “About three\r\nor four years ago,” said a competent observer, “a mania seized three\r\ngreat corporations (Atchison, Missouri Pacific, and Rock Island) to\r\ngridiron Kansas with railroad iron, and each tried hard to see which\r\ncould cover the most ground, without regard to the character of the\r\nground, the result [being that] railroads were built where they would\r\nnot be required for ten years to come.”[414] Such roads could not\r\nbe expected to pay, and in fact did not. Even in the case of better\r\nplanned extensions, the lines had to be built in an unopened territory,\r\nthe traffic of which had yet to be developed. In Indian Territory,\r\nOklahoma, and Arizona, the bulk of the country had less than two\r\ninhabitants to the square mile; in New Mexico and Lower California only\r\none-half of the area was more thickly settled; and it was largely from\r\nthis southwestern corner that local traffic for the Atchison had to be\r\nbuilt up.\r\n\r\nThe method of financiering these competitive extensions varied:\r\nsometimes the parent company guaranteed the principal and interest\r\nof the branch-line bonds; sometimes it took these into its treasury\r\nand issued collateral bonds against them; sometimes, perhaps more\r\nfrequently still, it leased new roads for a rental equivalent to the\r\nannual interest on their bonds. If the branches could have earned their\r\nfixed charges the burden on the Atchison would have been nominal, but\r\nas in large part they could not it was real and serious. In 1888 there\r\nwere actually paid in rentals, interest on Sonora Railway bonds, and on\r\nsundry railway bonds, $2,361,300. Large sums were carried to capital\r\naccount. In 1888 there was an accumulated account of “due from sundry\r\nleased, controlled, and auxiliary roads in construction and general\r\naccount” (net) $13,558,678, including various cash current construction\r\nand other charges, which was carried as an asset, but which in\r\nreality consisted of advances from which there was little or no hope\r\nof return. Besides the claims for interest the parent company had in\r\npractice other claims to meet. Where a branch failed to earn operating\r\nexpenses, as often happened, sums had to be advanced to keep the road\r\nand rolling stock in repair. Thus the item “due from auxiliary roads in\r\ncurrent traffic and operation accounts” amounted in 1888 to $1,008,554.\r\nBills and accounts payable the same year were $6,553,775, and accrued\r\ninterest, taxes, and sinking funds totalled $915,337. The following\r\ntable shows vividly the effect upon the system of the rapid extension\r\nof the years 1884 to 1888:\r\n\r\n_Total System_\r\n\r\n                                       1884              1888\r\n\r\n  Mileage                                2,799              7,010\r\n  Bonds                             48,258,500        163,694,000\r\n  Stock (Atchison)                  60,673,150         75,000,000\r\n  Gross earnings                    16,699,662         28,265,339\r\n  Operating expenses                 9,410,424         21,958,195\r\n  Net earnings from operation        7,289,237          6,307,145\r\n  Net profits, excluding dividends   5,147,883     def. 2,933,197\r\n  Net profits, including payments\r\n    for dividends and interest on\r\n    floating debt                                  def. 5,557,323\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said as to the necessity of extension, it is evident\r\nthat the position of the system by 1888 had changed for the worse. This\r\nlast-named year was a bad one, it is true, but certain evils of which\r\nthe directors then complained were permanent, and should have been\r\npermanently allowed for. Some realization of the fact that the Atchison\r\nmight be going too fast appeared in the financial journals of the time.\r\n“Were these undertakings less solidly backed,” said the _Railway Age_,\r\n“there might be apprehension that enterprise was being pushed too far\r\nand too fast.”[415] But on the whole the rapid growth and enormous\r\nextent of the system seem to dazzle beholders. “The career of this\r\ncompany,” said the _Railway Age_ again, “has been one of the marvels\r\nof railway enterprise, and it would be unsafe now to attempt to fix a\r\nlimit to its extension or to the ambition of its Napoleonic president\r\nand its bold and enterprising directors.”[416]\r\n\r\nIn 1887 the directors increased the rate of dividend from 6 to 7 per\r\ncent.[417] The action was thoroughly unjustifiable, and the rate was\r\nspeedily again reduced. By the end of 1888 the main company was liable\r\nto be called on any year to the extent of $8,625,365, which was the\r\namount of interest on auxiliary roads either guaranteed or payable as\r\nrentals. In four years the mileage of the Atchison system had increased\r\n150 per cent; its bonded indebtedness 239 per cent; its fixed charges\r\n216 per cent; and its gross earnings only 69 per cent; while the\r\ndeficits on its branch lines were obviously not matters of bookkeeping,\r\nand the value of interchanged business was not equal to the increased\r\nburdens which the subsidiary lines imposed. The floating debt mounted\r\nup, as is usual in times of trouble. From a total of $3,317,446 in\r\n1884 it increased to $8,076,059 in 1888. To offset it the directors\r\nsecured in October, 1888, subscriptions to a $10,000,000 issue of\r\n“guarantee fund,” three-year notes. Not all of the amount authorized\r\nwas to be sold at once, but from time to time Atchison was to call on\r\nsubscribers to take part of their subscription, and the notes were to\r\nbear 6 per cent from the time they were put forth.[418] For the rest,\r\nthe directors economized as much as possible. Salaries were cut 10 per\r\ncent in every branch of the service, beginning with the president, and\r\nthe unlucky 7 per cent rate of dividend was reduced to 6 per cent, to\r\n2 per cent, and then to nothing at all in successive quarters. None\r\nof these expedients proved sufficient. In fact, the situation was so\r\ncritical that nothing short of a general reorganization could probably\r\nhave secured the radical reduction in fixed charges which the company\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1889, accordingly, Messrs. Libby, Abbott, Peabody,\r\nand Baring were appointed a committee to consider the broad question\r\nof financial and general reorganization,[419] and in October a plan\r\nfor the complete rehabilitation of the company was brought forward.\r\nThe obligations with which the plan had to deal are indicated in the\r\nfollowing table:\r\n\r\n_Obligations of the Atchison Company in 1889_\r\n\r\n                                             _Principal_      _Interest_\r\n\r\n  Bonds, guarantee fund notes               $160,786,000   $9,203,620.00\r\n  Contingent issue of additional bonds           775,000       38,750.00\r\n  Car trusts                                   1,445,660       86,739.60\r\n                                            ------------   -------------\r\n                                            $163,006,660   $9,329,109.60\r\n\r\n  Less interest on bonds and guarantee\r\n    fund notes owned by the Company                           253,340.00\r\n                                                           -------------\r\n                                                           $9,075,769.60\r\n  Sinking Fund                                                359,000.00\r\n  Taxes                                                     1,221,000.00\r\n  Rentals                                                     502,000.00\r\n                                                          --------------\r\n                                                          $11,157,769.60\r\nOf the bonds outstanding $56,498,000 were direct loans upon the\r\nAtchison’s main lines, bearing anywhere from 4½ to 7 per cent, and\r\n$104,288,000 were bonds upon some of the thirty-two subsidiary\r\ncorporations for whose obligations the Atchison was responsible.\r\n\r\nThe dealing of the Libby Committee with this situation was intelligent\r\nand comprehensive. It proposed an increase and simplification of\r\nsecurities, a decrease in fixed charges, and a cancellation of the\r\nfloating debt. In place of the forty-one classes of bonds outstanding\r\nit suggested that two grand issues be put forth, one of 4 per cent\r\ngeneral mortgage bonds to the amount of $150,000,000, and one of 5\r\nper cent income bonds to a total of $80,000,000. From these issues\r\n$13,750,000 should be used to provide for cash requirements,[420]\r\nand the remainder should be employed in direct retirement of old\r\nobligations. The exchange of some $216,000,000 of new bonds for\r\n$163,000,000 of old was to mean an increase in securities outstanding,\r\nbut since interest on only part of the new bonds was to be obligatory\r\nfixed charges were to be less than they had been before. The managers\r\nfigured on what the property could earn, good times or bad, and\r\ncapitalized this sum into 4 per cent general mortgage bonds. They\r\nthen calculated the difference between this and the former return to\r\nbondholders, and capitalized the difference into income bonds.[421]\r\nEach individual bondholder, therefore, was offered a chance to receive\r\nthe same return which he had previously enjoyed, although his right to\r\ndemand an annual payment was limited to an amount which the road could\r\nearn.\r\n\r\nA few points deserve to be specially noticed. The reduction in interest\r\nwas sufficient to have transformed the deficit for the whole Atchison\r\nsystem for 1888 into a respectable surplus, providing that no dividends\r\nhad been paid; but this reduction was dependent on the retention of the\r\nincome bonds as optional obligations. There was no cash assessment. Had\r\nthe reorganization taken place in a time of general depression, the\r\nsale of securities for cash would probably have been impossible, but\r\nthe days of depression had not yet arrived. The stockholder suffered\r\nin the introduction of the principal of some $67,000,000 additional\r\nindebtedness between him and his property, although he was not called\r\nupon directly; but it should not be forgotten that for a long while\r\nthe Atchison stockholders had received very liberal dividends, both in\r\nstock and in cash, and could not well complain of the moderate loss now\r\nnecessary. There was no voting trust, although one was proposed, and\r\nthe bonds were not even temporarily given voting power. The situation\r\nseems to have been that the securityholders thought it more to their\r\nadvantage to reduce voluntarily the rate of interest than to force\r\na foreclosure sale and take their chances; for the directors, in\r\nsubmitting the plan, said that they felt it necessary “to state in the\r\nstrongest terms that the non-success of this proposal will inevitably\r\nresult in foreclosure, with all its attendant misfortunes.”[422]\r\n\r\nBy the end of November, although the plan had not been promulgated\r\nuntil well into October, more than one-half of the outstanding bonds\r\nhad assented, and the directors were enabled to announce success.\r\nCertain changes in the management had already taken place. President\r\nStrong had resigned in September, and had been succeeded by Mr. Allen\r\nManville, general manager of the St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba\r\nRailway.[423] Mr. Reinhart was credited with a large part in the\r\nconstruction of the new plan of 1889, and his later promotion may have\r\nbeen connected therewith.\r\n\r\nAfter the reorganization Atchison resumed its policy of expansion,\r\nits new directors being apparently as “bold and enterprising” as the\r\nold. In 1890 it took in the St. Louis & San Francisco, a road running\r\nfrom St. Louis west and southwest through Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas,\r\nand Indian Territory, connecting at Paris, Texas, with the Gulf,\r\nColorado & Santa Fe, and through half-ownership of the Atlantic &\r\nPacific connecting Albuquerque in New Mexico with Barstow in Southern\r\nCalifornia. The total length of the Frisco system, exclusive of jointly\r\nowned roads, was 1329 miles, and this constituted the largest single\r\nacquisition that the Atchison had ever made. The terms of the purchase\r\nwere highly favorable to the Frisco shareholders, but the benefits to\r\nthe Atchison were less than was expected. Although the consolidation\r\nremoved certain difficulties experienced from the joint ownership\r\nof the Atlantic & Pacific, and although the united roads were in a\r\nbetter position to compete for transcontinental and Gulf traffic than\r\neither of them had been before, the Atchison directors were forced to\r\nannounce in 1891 that, “with every opportunity given it to work with\r\nadvantage, the property (Frisco) has failed to demonstrate its ability\r\nto carry itself financially and to liquidate its debts; nor could it\r\nhope to obtain such results without the provision of New Capital....\r\nThis is due largely to the absence of complete and proper facilities\r\nand machinery with which to conduct operations in the nature of Round\r\nHouses, Machine Shops, Stations and other buildings, improved Bridges\r\nand Equipment.”[424] A bond issue was needed, and was in fact put\r\nforth,—the Atchison taking a goodly share.\r\n\r\nLess important than this was the purchase, in 1890, of the Colorado\r\nMidland, a road 346 miles long in Colorado, valued chiefly for its ore\r\ntraffic. In August, 1890, the Mexican Government resumed payment of the\r\nSonora subsidy, on which nothing had been paid for eight years.[425]\r\nIt does not seem as if at any time after 1889 the Atchison enjoyed\r\nunalloyed prosperity. The year 1890 showed an increase in net earnings\r\nof 48 per cent according to the figures given, and the directors were\r\nunhappy until they had increased the fixed charges to match, but the\r\nyear 1891 recorded a falling off, and 1892 showed a comparatively\r\nslight gain over the figures of 1891. There was obviously nothing\r\nin the reported figures to cause alarm, but there was nothing which\r\njustified the payment of more than 2¾ per cent any year on the income\r\nbonds, or of any dividends on the stock.\r\n\r\nToward the end of 1891 the guarantee fund notes fell due. They had been\r\nissued, it will be remembered, to protect the property in 1888, and\r\nwere secured by an equal amount of general mortgage 4s; but now the\r\ndirectors, disliking to put these 4s on the market at 83¼, decided to\r\nextend the notes for two years at par with a cash commission of one per\r\ncent.[426]\r\n\r\nExtension of the guarantee fund notes did not increase the fixed\r\nobligations, it merely postponed a reduction; but the conversion of\r\nthe income bonds of 1889 acted as a positive increase. There were\r\n$80,000,000 of these incomes, and it was in the optional character\r\nof payments upon them that the saving of fixed charges by the\r\nreorganization of 1889 had consisted. They had been issued instead of\r\npreferred stock probably because more acceptable to the bondholders;\r\nbut it was early found that their use involved difficulties which had\r\nnot been sufficiently regarded. By the conditions of their indenture\r\nno bonds could be inserted between them and the general mortgage 4s;\r\nthey held a second lien for all time. But similarly it was difficult\r\nto put bonds after them. Their lien was on income,—interest was\r\npayable only when earned; any regular mortgage would of necessity have\r\ntaken precedence. The hindrance to new issues was real and serious,\r\nand although some check on an aggressive management was salutary, yet\r\nthe system required additions and improvements from time to time which\r\ncould not be supplied from current income. Under these circumstances\r\nthe Atchison directors decided within three years to sacrifice the\r\nreduction in fixed charges secured in 1889 in order to obtain new\r\ncapital with greater ease. “It is the opinion of the Management,” said\r\nthe annual report for 1892, “that the time has now arrived when all the\r\nobligations of the Company can be returned to a Fixed Basis, sufficient\r\nfunds provided to take care of all Improvements ... required for at\r\nleast four years, and at the same time the junior Bonds and Capital\r\nStock be restored to a more permanent market value with assured returns\r\non the first, and probable balances for the latter.”[427] “The Atchison\r\nplan of conversion,” said Mr. Reinhart, “... is the completion of the\r\nreorganization plan put in effect October 18, 1889, and returns the\r\nobligations of the company ... to a fixed and stable basis....”[428]\r\n\r\nThe plan so cordially referred to provided for the issue of a new,\r\nsecond mortgage, 4 per cent bond, and the exchange of this security for\r\nthe outstanding income bonds. The second mortgage was to be issued in\r\ntwo classes:\r\n\r\n(_a_) $80,000,000. These were to exchange for income 5s, par for par,\r\nand bore a rate of interest which increased from 2½ per cent in 1892 to\r\n4 per cent in 1896, and then remained at 4 per cent until maturity.\r\n\r\n(_b_) $20,000,000. These bore 4 per cent and were to be issued in no\r\ngreater sum in any year than $5,000,000 for specific improvements on\r\nthe Atchison exclusive of the Colorado Midland or the St. Louis & San\r\nFrancisco. There was reserved to the company the right, when all the\r\nabove should have been exhausted, to issue more bonds of the same sort\r\nas in class B for the same purposes and on the same mileage, up to a\r\nlimit of $50,000,000.[429]\r\n\r\nThe conversion plan was approved at the annual meeting in 1892, and was\r\nput into effect. The result was most unfortunate. The annual burden\r\non the company was increased at the very time when the panic of 1893\r\nwas about to reduce railroad earnings, while the advantages of freer\r\nissues of new bonds were of little account in a year when the sale of\r\nnew securities was practically impossible. Moreover, a new light was\r\nsoon to be thrown on the whole operation by disclosures of dishonest\r\nmanipulation of figures in the Atchison reports.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 and 1893 rumors of trouble were afloat, and were repeatedly and\r\nvigorously denied by Mr. Reinhart, president of the Atchison Company.\r\nThus in June, 1893, this officer declared that “the Atchison, Topeka\r\n& Santa Fe Railroad Company, strictly speaking, has no floating debt.\r\nIts current liabilities are more than equalled by its current cash\r\nassets.”[430] In December Mr. Reinhart said again: “The interest on the\r\nGeneral Mortgage Bonds of the Atchison Company, due January 1, will\r\nbe paid. It seems hardly necessary to make this statement, because\r\ndoubts as to its payment have, in my judgment, been created solely by\r\nspeculators who have no substantial interest in the property.” These\r\nofficial denials did not carry conviction, but opinions varied as to\r\nthe seriousness of the situation. The _Boston News Bureau_ cheerily\r\ninsisted that all the Atchison needed was “days of grace” during the\r\nexisting depression,[431] while in England it was thought that the\r\nrumors of a receivership were at most but premature.[432]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year President Reinhart went to Europe to float\r\na loan. On his return, after a failure to obtain subscriptions, a\r\nreceivership was applied for and granted. It had been hoped up to\r\nthe very last moment that the January interest could be met; but the\r\nrefusal of English bondholders to subscribe additional capital, the\r\nfailure to place a third mortgage loan in the United States, and the\r\ndeath of Director Magoun, one of the strong influences in Atchison’s\r\naffairs, made a crash inevitable. Current obligations had mounted to\r\nover $10,000,000, credit had disappeared, and the railroad necessarily\r\nsuccumbed. The Atlantic & Pacific, the Colorado Midland, the Gulf,\r\nColorado & Santa Fe, and the Southern California lines were not\r\nincluded in the Atchison receivership, though the Atchison receivers\r\nwere given like office in respect to the Atlantic & Pacific.[433] The\r\nGulf, Colorado & Santa Fe announced that it would continue to operate\r\nits own line, and was prepared to pay its current obligations as\r\nbefore.[434]\r\n\r\nNo sooner was failure announced than committees of bondholders sprang\r\nup. In Boston a committee was formed with six members, including J. L.\r\nThorndike and H. L. Higginson. In New York the Union Trust Company, the\r\nMercantile Trust Company, the New York Life Insurance Company, Baring,\r\nMagoun & Co., and Giddes & Smith got together in a committee, with\r\nEdward King as chairman. A second New York committee, R. Somers Hayes,\r\nchairman, was formed by express invitation of the road. A directors’\r\ncommittee was organized, of which E. B. Cheney, Jr., was chairman.\r\nThe London holders of the second mortgage class A bonds themselves\r\nformed a committee. Even before 1888 Englishmen had invested heavily\r\nin Atchison, attracted perhaps by glowing stories of the business to\r\nspring up across the western plains. It was said that not only had\r\nthey been influential in shaping the reorganization of 1889, but that\r\nfrom that date to 1893 the management had been controlled by a board\r\nelected by proxies entrusted to representatives of English interest.\r\nIn particular Englishmen had become interested in the second mortgage\r\nbonds of 1892, successors to the income bonds of 1889, holding about\r\none-half of the total issue, and they now fought for the protection of\r\nthis issue as against the stock.\r\n\r\nA plan of reorganization was early matured after the English influence\r\nsubstantially as follows: Either the general mortgage or the second\r\nmortgage bonds were to be foreclosed and a new company was to be\r\nformed. If the foreclosure should be under the general mortgage,\r\noverdue interest on that mortgage was not to be paid, and new\r\nsecurities, similar to the existing bonds, were to be issued, bond\r\nfor bond. If the foreclosure should be under the second mortgage, the\r\ncompany was to provide for past due interest, and was to assume the\r\npayment of principal and interest on the general mortgage bonds. The\r\ncapital stock was to remain as before. There was to be a new income\r\nmortgage to the amount of $115,000,000, of which $84,000,000 were to\r\ngo for the existing second mortgage A bonds, and $5,600,000 for the\r\nexisting B bonds; the surplus to be given for assessments, or for\r\nthe securities of such auxiliary companies as it should be thought\r\nadvisable to acquire. These income bonds were to bear 5 per cent and\r\nwere to have voting power. There was to be a second mortgage, to amount\r\neventually to $35,000,000; of which $5,000,000 were to be used at once\r\nto retire the floating debt and for other purposes, and $3,000,000 were\r\nto be used each year for improvements. The new stock was to be held\r\nin trust until 5 per cent per annum should have been paid in cash on\r\nthe new income bonds for three consecutive years. Finally there was to\r\nbe an assessment of $12 per share upon the stockholders, the proceeds\r\nof which were to go as far as necessary to pay the debts of the old\r\ncompany, including interest on the general mortgage.[435]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the scheme was to put the Atchison back to the condition\r\nof 1889, and to regain the margin of safety afforded by the income\r\nbonds. So far it was acceptable enough. Conservative officers had\r\nlooked askance at the income bond conversion in 1892, and this was a\r\nsimple acknowledgment of the mistake. The old difficulty as to future\r\ncapital requirements, moreover, was evaded by a provision for an annual\r\nincrement of second mortgage bonds to take precedence of the incomes.\r\nThe notable part of the scheme was the anxious care of the bondholders\r\nto protect themselves. Since their bonds had been converted from income\r\nbonds less than two years before they could not claim a large allowance\r\nfor the reconversion; but as a condition of their assent to this and\r\nto the introduction of a second mortgage for $35,000,000 before their\r\nlien they demanded not only a bonus of 5 per cent in the new incomes\r\nfor their holdings, but the grant of voting power to the income bonds,\r\na stock assessment of $12 per share, and the interposition of an\r\nadditional $5,000,000 of bonds between the stock and the property of\r\nwhich it was nominally the possessor. “It is true,” said the _Railway\r\nReview_, “that the scheme contemplates the issue of income bonds which\r\nshall be given to assenting stockholders at par in return for the cash\r\nassessment, but it is a little difficult to see wherein such bonds\r\nare of very much more value than the stock of the company except that\r\nthey are not subject to assessment.”[436] The reception of the plan\r\nwas what might have been expected. On July 30, in London, the London\r\nbondholders’ committee met and passed a resolution in its favor. Having\r\nnow secured, they said in substance, the substantial features for which\r\nthey had contended, and although the plan was not altogether what they\r\ncould have desired, they considered, after very prolonged and anxious\r\nnegotiations, that a plan had been arrived at which was the best\r\nobtainable in the interests of bondholders.[437] Meanwhile meetings of\r\nstockholders were held in New York in protest. Resolutions were adopted\r\ncondemning the plan, and a stockholders’ committee was chosen.[438]\r\n\r\nDebate was stopped by the publication in August of the report of an\r\nexpert who had been selected to examine the books of the Atchison\r\nCompany. Few more disgraceful instances of the juggling of figures have\r\nbeen brought to light in the history of American railroad finance.\r\nWhereas the reports of the company had shown net earnings steadily\r\nincreasing from $7,600,000 in 1890 to $12,100,000 in 1893, being ample\r\nto meet existing charges and to pay from 2 to 2¾ per cent on the income\r\nbonds besides to the time of their conversion, Mr. Little, the expert,\r\nreported that the net earnings had never exceeded $8,085,608; and\r\nmaintained that an annual deficit had occurred each year from 1894,\r\nwhich reached the portentous amount of $3,000,000 for 1891 alone. The\r\ncondition of the company was far worse than had been imagined, and all\r\nplans had to be thoroughly recast. The following is an abstract of the\r\nreport in question:\r\n\r\n“I have already advised you verbally,” said Mr. Little, “that income\r\nwas, in my judgment, overstated in these several years (since ’89), to\r\nthe extent of $7,000,000 or more, and I now confirm this specifically.\r\nThese overstatements may be classified as follows:\r\n\r\n“(1) _Rebates._ For the four years ending June 30, 1894, the debits\r\nfor rebates to shippers on the Atchison system aggregated $3,700,776,\r\nand on the St. Louis & San Francisco system $205,879, or a total of\r\n$3,906,656.\r\n\r\n“This sum was charged, not to the earnings from whence it came, as it\r\nshould have been, but to an account entitled, ‘_Auditor’s Suspended\r\nAccount-Special_,’ and was reported from year to year as a good and\r\navailable asset, while in fact it had no value whatsoever.\r\n\r\n“(2) _Additions to Earnings and Deductions from Expenses._ Next in\r\norder of importance to the rebate account comes an aggregate of\r\n$2,791,000, which, on instructions from the East, was credited from\r\ntime to time to the earnings and expenses respectively, but which\r\ncredit has no foundation in fact. Of this aggregate $2,010,000 was\r\nadded to earnings and $781,000 deducted from operating expenses, the\r\nsum of the two being debited to ‘_Auditor’s Suspended Account_.’\r\n\r\n“(3) _Improvements._ The sum of $488,000 was in the period under\r\nconsideration transferred, improperly as I contend, from Operating\r\nExpenses to Improvements or Capital Account, these Improvements being\r\nfinally closed into the account of Franchises and Property, which\r\nrepresents the cost of the road and property.\r\n\r\n“(4) _Traffic Balances._ It further appears that a traffic agreement\r\nfor a division of business was formed in November, 1890 (running to\r\nJuly, 1891), between the Atchison Company and certain other companies,\r\nwhereby such other companies were charged with a balance of $305,843,\r\nwhich the Atchison Company was unable to collect, and which is\r\nabsolutely uncollectable, and should have been heretofore written off,\r\nthough it still stands as an asset, and hence must be written to the\r\ndebit of profit and loss.”[439]\r\n\r\nTwo facts appear from these charges on which emphasis was laid from\r\ndifferent points of view: (1) That for four years the Atchison had\r\nbeen persistently violating the law by the granting of rebates. (2)\r\nThat to conceal these rebates, and for other purposes, the books had\r\nbeen so systematically falsified as to defy detection, and to deceive\r\nnot only the investing public but the whole railroad world. The\r\nreport was handed to Mr. Reinhart, and an answer was requested by the\r\nfollowing day. The answer was made, and proved inadequate; for though\r\nMr. Reinhart pointed out some half-dozen items which he argued that\r\nMr. Little had wrongly excluded, he explained no one of the charges\r\ndirectly brought against him.[440] There is no doubt at the present\r\ntime that Mr. Reinhart was guilty, though perhaps because of the\r\ndifficulty of fixing legal responsibility he was never prosecuted for\r\nfalsification of the books. He resigned, of course, and Major Aldace\r\nF. Walker was appointed receiver in his stead. Two months later he was\r\nindicted with other officers of the company and certain shippers, not\r\nfor falsifying the books, but for the illegal granting of rebates. His\r\ndefence was that he had been, at the time the rebates were given, only\r\nthe general auditor at Boston, and had had no part in the fiscal or\r\nexecutive business of the road.[441] The Government failed to prove\r\nconnection, and the case fell through.\r\n\r\nAll this completely altered the requirements to be met by a\r\nreorganization plan. A more sweeping reduction in charges, and a\r\nmore general distribution of losses was needed than before had been\r\nthe case. Old proposals were laid aside once and for all, and a new\r\nscheme was built up from the beginning. The mortgage indebtedness of\r\nthe Atchison in 1895 was $233,595,247, of which the first and second\r\nmortgage bonds comprised $217,258,276. The reorganization of 1889 had\r\ndone its work in one respect at least, and the reorganization managers\r\nwere able to concentrate their attention on two issues. The annual net\r\nearnings, according to the company’s reports had been:\r\n\r\n  1890      $7,632,348\r\n  1891       7,631,598\r\n  1892      10,953,896\r\n  1893      12,126,866\r\n\r\nbut as corrected in Mr. Little’s report were:\r\n\r\n  1891      $5,204,880\r\n  1892       7,853,173\r\n  1893       8,085,608\r\n  1894       5,956,615\r\n\r\nInasmuch as Mr. Little had discovered annual deficits of\r\n\r\n  1891      $1,964,285\r\n  1892          60,938\r\n  1893         134,825\r\n  1894       3,008,242\r\n\r\nit was very evident that a reduction in interest charges was called\r\nfor. As in 1889 the salvation of the company was sought in the\r\nsubstitution of securities on which payment was optional for securities\r\nbearing an obligatory charge.\r\n\r\nSoon after Mr. Little’s final report in November three of the existing\r\ncommittees, namely, the General Reorganization Committee, the London\r\nCommittee, and Messrs. Hope & Co. of Amsterdam, joined in a Joint\r\nExecutive Reorganization Committee, with Edward King as chairman.[442]\r\nWith these now worked a committee chosen by the directors themselves.\r\nThe result was a reorganization plan under date of March 14, 1895. The\r\npurposes announced were:\r\n\r\n(_a_) To reduce fixed charges to a safe limit;\r\n\r\n(_b_) To make adequate provision for future capital requirements,\r\nsubject to proper restrictions as to issue of bonds for this purpose;\r\n\r\n(_c_) To liquidate the floating debt, and to make adequate provision\r\nfor existing prior lien indebtedness shortly to mature;\r\n\r\n(_d_) To reinstate existing securities upon equitable terms in their\r\norder of priority;\r\n\r\n(_e_) To consolidate and unify the system (so far as practicable) and\r\nthus to save large annual expense.\r\n\r\nIt was proposed to foreclose the Atchison general mortgage ... and to\r\nvest in a railway company the bonds, stocks, and other properties of\r\nthe existing company, acquired at foreclosure sale or otherwise. The\r\nnew company was to issue:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Common Stock                                   $102,000,000\r\n  (_b_) Five per cent non-cumulative preferred stock    111,486,000\r\n  (_c_) General mortgage 4 per cent bonds                96,990,582\r\n  (_d_) Adjustment 4 per cent bonds                      51,728,310[443]\r\n\r\nOf the above the interest on only the general mortgage bonds was to be\r\na fixed charge;—the stock obviously got a return only when earned,\r\nand the adjustment bonds were income bonds in fact if not in name.\r\nAdditional issues to a comparatively small aggregate were provided\r\nfor, but no mortgage, other than the general and adjustment mortgages,\r\nwas to be executed by the company, nor was the amount of preferred\r\nstock to be increased, unless the execution of such mortgage, or such\r\nincrease of preferred stock, should have received the consent of the\r\nholders of a majority of the whole amount of preferred stock at the\r\ntime outstanding, given at a meeting of the stockholders called for\r\nthat purpose, and the consent of the holders of a majority of such\r\npart of the common stock as should be represented at said meeting. The\r\nsecurities mentioned were to retire all previously existing issues.\r\nOld common stockholders were to receive share for share in the common\r\nstock of the new company. They were to be assessed $10 per share,\r\nand to receive for the assessment $10 in new preferred stock, while a\r\nsyndicate guaranteed payment of assessments by engaging to take the\r\nplace of non-assenting or defaulting stockholders. The general mortgage\r\nbondholders were to get 75 per cent of their holdings in new general\r\nmortgage 4s and 40 per cent in adjustment 4s. The second mortgage and\r\nincome bondholders were to be assessed 4 per cent and were to get\r\nnew preferred stock.[444] The prior lien bondholders were dealt with\r\nseparately, and were to be paid either in general mortgage 4s of the\r\nadditional issues (over the $96,990,582) mentioned, or in the new\r\nprior lien bonds. If in the latter, the general mortgage bonds which\r\nwould otherwise have been issued were to be held for the ultimate\r\nretirement of these bonds. Provision was made for future construction\r\nand additions by the allowance of $3,000,000 general mortgage bonds, to\r\nbe issued each year to a limit of $30,000,000, and then of $2,000,000\r\nadjustment bonds, to be issued each year to a limit of $20,000,000.\r\nAdditional new general mortgage bonds, up to $20,000,000, might be\r\nissued and used in such amounts respectively and in such proportions as\r\nthe Joint Executive Committee might determine, for the acquisition of\r\nthe Atlantic & Pacific, the St. Louis & San Francisco, and the Colorado\r\nMidland; and for like purposes $20,000,000 preferred stock. The lien\r\nof the new general mortgage was to cover all properties which should\r\nbe vested in the new company, and also any other property which might\r\nbe acquired by use of any of the new bonds, but the Joint Executive\r\nCommittee might, in its discretion, except from the new general\r\nmortgage the stocks and bonds deposited under the existing general\r\nmortgage, representing branch lines, the operation of which should\r\nbe found to be unprofitable and an unnecessary burden to the system.\r\nA voting trust was considered, but was rejected as unsatisfactory;\r\nand the committee confined its efforts to the securing of the best\r\npossible management.\r\n\r\n  The proposed fixed charges amounted to                 $4,528,547\r\n  Net earnings according to Mr. Little had been in 1891   5,204,880\r\n                                                   1892   7,853,173\r\n                                                   1893   8,085,608\r\n                                                   1894   5,956,615\r\n\r\nThus the new charges appeared well within the earning power of the\r\nroad. The plan made the following, provision for cash requirements:\r\n\r\n  Assessment on Atchison stock at $10 per share         $10,000,000\r\n  Assessment on second mortgage and on income bonds at\r\n    4 per cent                                            3,567,644\r\n                                                        -----------\r\n                                                        $13,567,644\r\n\r\nThe estimated cash requirements were:\r\n\r\n  For receiver’s debt, preferred or secured floating\r\n   debt of the Atchison Company, estimated as of\r\n   January 1, 1895                                       $7,793,875\r\n  Leaving for receivers and floating debt, accrued\r\n    interest and undisturbed securities, etc.,              773,769\r\n                                                        -----------\r\n                                                        $13,567,644[445]\r\n\r\nThis reorganization had certain interesting features. As before\r\nremarked, it sought, as did the reorganization of 1889, to replace\r\nsecurities, the interest on which was a fixed charge, by securities\r\non which payment of interest or dividends should be optional. But\r\nwhereas the earlier reorganization had depended on income bonds,\r\nthis plan included both income bonds and preferred stock. There are\r\nseveral reasons why preferred stock is preferable to income bonds,\r\nand it will be remembered that a peculiar difficulty experienced\r\nfrom the income bonds of 1889 had arisen from the impossibility\r\nof putting other mortgages ahead of them; yet that this was not\r\nthe chief obstacle sought to be avoided by the use of preferred\r\nstock at this later date appears from the current use of adjustment\r\nbonds. Provision for future capital requirements was in fact made in\r\nanother way, and the question was not here involved. So far as the\r\nacceptability of the income bonds and the preferred stock respectively\r\nto the old bondholders was concerned, it should be noted that the\r\nmen who received the greater part of the new issue were the holders\r\nof the old income and second mortgage bonds; that is, Englishmen\r\nwho had already shown their preference for income bonds as opposed\r\nto stock. The chief reason for the new expedient seems to have been\r\nthe desire to retain for the general mortgage holders a priority\r\nof lien, while reducing part of their holdings to the level of an\r\noptional obligation. If income bonds or preferred stock alone had\r\nbeen used, these would necessarily have been given to the owners both\r\nof general mortgage and of second mortgage or old income bonds; so\r\nthat the former might have received a larger amount, but not any lien\r\ndifferent in kind. By the scheme proposed, all possible interest on\r\nthe securities given for old mortgage 4s was to be met before anything\r\nwas to be paid on the equivalent of issues which had been inferior\r\nbefore the reorganization took place. Abundant provision was made for\r\nfuture capital requirements. That lesson had been learned once for\r\nall. Cash requirements were met by an assessment. In speaking of the\r\nreorganization of 1889 the rule was laid down that the disposal of\r\nsecurities for cash is impossible except at an enormous sacrifice in a\r\ntime of general depression. There was widespread depression in 1895,\r\nand the reorganization managers wisely made no attempt to negotiate\r\na sale. The amount of the assessment on the common stock was very\r\nconsiderably above the quoted price of the shares, but it was correctly\r\nfigured that the hope of future increase in value would be sufficient\r\nto induce stockholders to furnish the sums required. Not to tax them\r\ntoo heavily call was made also on the junior securities. On the whole,\r\nthe decrease of $5,000,000 in fixed charges more than compensated the\r\nstockholders for the additional obligations put between them and their\r\nproperty; their claim on the road itself was made more remote, but\r\ntheir chances for dividends were improved. Examination of the plan\r\nshows clearly that nothing was taken from either bonds or stock which\r\nthose securities had a right to retain. The bondholders could not, in\r\nany case, have received more than the earnings of the road; and an\r\namount equal to the return previously due them was assured, whenever\r\nthe road should earn it, by the new combination of mortgage and income\r\nbonds and preferred stock. As it was, in return for an assessment they\r\nretained the right to participate in any future prosperity, a right\r\nwhich has proved of extreme value.\r\n\r\nThe plan was underwritten by Messrs. Baring Bros. & Co. and other\r\nstrong foreign and American bankers, who assumed the liability of\r\npaying the assessment and of taking the stock.[446] The comment at the\r\ntime was favorable. “On the whole,” said the _Railway Age_, “we do\r\nnot believe that any one who is acquainted with the properties could\r\nhave expected a more satisfactory plan than that which the committee\r\nhas evolved.”[447] The London bondholders promptly accepted the plan.\r\n“We are disposed,” said the _Railway Times_ of London, “to regard the\r\nlatest of Atchison reorganization schemes as a praiseworthy attempt\r\nto grapple with a very thorny problem.”[448] Such opposition as there\r\nwas came from a minority of the stockholders, and was directed at two\r\npoints: the prevention of foreclosure, and the inauguration of an\r\nentirely new administration. It was asserted that certain old members\r\nof the board of directors who had been forced to resign by the earlier\r\ndisclosures, had nevertheless secured the election of successors to\r\nperpetuate their policy and to protect their interest. With a directory\r\nso constituted, it was maintained that the stockholders would have no\r\nguarantee of important changes in the executive offices, financial\r\npolicies, or business methods of the company.[449] Sharp criticism was\r\ndirected to a statement of the existing board which referred to the\r\n“mistakes and misfortunes of the previous management.” “Only those who\r\nbelieve,” said the Stockholders’ Protective Committee, “that gross\r\nirregularities, if not worse, have been perpetrated ... may be relied\r\nupon to probe to the bottom the acts of the former officers of the\r\nAtchison.”[450] On the other hand, the accusations of the committee\r\nwere asserted by the directors to be unqualifiedly false.[451] It soon\r\nbecame apparent that the opposition could not muster enough votes to\r\ncontrol an election, and although their fight had been begun in August,\r\nthey had proxies by November for only 250,000 out of the 1,020,000\r\nshares of stock. Recourse was had to the courts, and an attempt was\r\nmade to secure at least a minority representation on the coming board\r\nby the enforcement of a provision for cumulative voting embodied in\r\na Kansas law of 1879. This failed in November, 1894, and no further\r\nobstacle to reorganization was encountered.\r\n\r\nPractically all of the assessments were paid in by September 21. On\r\nNovember 25 Mr. E. P. Ripley was elected president, and in the first\r\nweek of December, 1895, Mr. Aldace F. Walker was elected chairman of\r\nthe board of directors of the new company. On December 10, 1895, the\r\nproperty and franchises of the Atchison were sold at foreclosure, and\r\nwere purchased for $60,000,000 by Edward King, Charles C. Beaman, and\r\nVictor Morawetz, representing the reorganization committee.[452] The\r\nAtchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad Company was then organized by\r\nthe purchasers pursuant to the laws of Kansas, under a certificate\r\nof incorporation dated December 12, 1895. A board of directors was\r\nelected, and by-laws were adopted. The entire estate embraced in the\r\nforeclosure sale was duly conveyed by deed of the same date as the\r\nincorporation of the company, in consideration of which the company\r\nexecuted a delivery to the Joint Executive Reorganization Committee\r\nof the securities acquired under the plan of reorganization. Certain\r\nsubsidiary roads were subsequently foreclosed and bought in, notably\r\nthe Atlantic & Pacific and the Chicago, Santa Fe & California. The St.\r\nLouis & San Francisco was not so bought in. “The question of retaining\r\nthe St. Louis & San Francisco as a part of the Atchison system,” said\r\nthe annual report of 1896, “received very careful consideration from\r\nthe Directors.... A series of conferences was held, which resulted in\r\nthe matter ultimately presenting the alternative of the sale of our\r\nexisting interest upon favorable terms, or the purchase by us of all\r\nother outstanding interests upon terms involving the outlay of a very\r\nlarge amount of both cash and securities. While the future control\r\nof that road was regarded as important, the financial considerations\r\naffecting the situation prevailed, and the sale was decided on the\r\nwhole to be more prudent than the purchase.” “With the acquisition of\r\nthe Frisco,” said Mr. Fleming of the Joint Executive Committee, “the\r\nfixed charges on the Atchison system of 7780 miles would have been\r\nincreased from $7000 to $9000 per mile. Atchison is financially much\r\nstronger without Frisco.”\r\n\r\nThis ends that part of the history of the Atchison Company which can\r\nbe connected with either of its reorganizations. From 1895 to the\r\npresent time the Atchison has enjoyed a rapidly increasing prosperity,\r\ndue in part to the lightening of the charges upon it, in part to able\r\nmanagement, and in part to the great increase in volume of business\r\nwhich has been a characteristic of the time. One or two things may\r\nbe noted. A final settlement has been made of the relations between\r\nthe Southern Pacific and the Atchison in the Southwest. It will be\r\nremembered that the final result of the negotiations in 1882 had been\r\nthe purchase of the former Mojave division from the Needles to Mojave,\r\nbut that since title could not be acquired until the maturity of the\r\noutstanding mortgages, Atchison had leased this track at an annual\r\nrental of 6 per cent on the purchase price. In 1897 this rental was\r\ncancelled. The Southern Pacific could not even then give a clear title,\r\nbut exchanged a long time lease of the Mojave division against a\r\nsimilar lease of the Sonora Railway, the Atchison branch which reached\r\nfrom Deming to Guaymas. The rentals cancelled each other, and the\r\nactual transfer is eventually to take place.[453] The arrangement is\r\nmutually advantageous. On the one hand the Mojave division formed a\r\nspur of the Southern Pacific, and on the other the Sonora Railway was\r\ntotally disconnected from the Atchison, so that the latter company was\r\nobliged to use the Southern Pacific’s tracks to reach the property at\r\nall. In 1898 Chairman Walker of the Executive Committee was able to\r\nannounce the substantial completion of negotiations for the purchase\r\nof the San Francisco & San Joaquin Valley Railroad, running from\r\nBakersfield to Stockton, California; the former town being sixty-eight\r\nmiles from Mojave and the latter something less than that from San\r\nFrancisco.[454] Atchison at once began building at the Stockton end,\r\nand reached San Francisco the following year. The Santa Fe Terminal\r\nCompany was then incorporated with a capital stock of $1,000,000,\r\nAtchison secured a traffic contract with the Southern Pacific, and\r\nthrough freight trains were run from Chicago to San Francisco on May 1,\r\n1900, through passenger trains following two months later. Besides this\r\nthere have been important extensions in Arizona and New Mexico. In 1901\r\nthe Atchison purchased two-thirds of the bonds, and practically all of\r\nthe capital stock of the Pecos Valley & Northeastern Railway Company,\r\nstretching 370 miles from Texico through the southeastern corner of\r\nNew Mexico to Pecos City, Texas. In July of the same year it bought\r\nthe Santa Fe, Prescott & Phœnix Railroad, from Ash Fork, Arizona, to\r\nPhœnix, Arizona, some 195 miles. Construction has been practically\r\ncompleted between Belen, New Mexico, a few miles south of Albuquerque,\r\nand Amarillo, Texas, to afford an alternative and somewhat shorter\r\nroute from California to Eastern Kansas. A still more noteworthy\r\nproject is under consideration for a road to join the Gulf, Colorado &\r\nSanta Fe at Brownwood with the Belen line at Texico, and to open direct\r\nconnection over the Atchison from California to the Gulf.\r\n\r\nBriefly stated, the Atchison’s mileage has increased from 6479 miles in\r\n1897, to 9273 in 1907. Its gross earnings have grown from $30,621,230\r\nto $93,683,407; its net earnings from $7,754,041 to $32,153,692; and\r\nits surplus above all charges from $1,452,446 to $21,168,724. This\r\nmarvellous showing has been accompanied by heavy expenditures for\r\nimprovements, so that the physical condition of the system is much\r\nbetter than before. Operating expenses, fixed charges, and taxes\r\ntook less than 77 per cent of gross income in 1907, and a decline\r\nof over $21,000,000 can be suffered in net before interest on even\r\nthe adjustment bonds becomes imperilled. It is not to be wondered\r\nat that Mr. Harriman saw fit to invest $10,395,000 of Union Pacific\r\nmoney in Atchison preferred stock in 1906,[455] nor that dividends\r\nof 5 per cent on preferred, and 5 per cent on common stock are being\r\npaid. The Atchison owns 1791 locomotives instead of 953 as in 1897;\r\n1135 passenger cars instead of 622; 49,770 freight cars instead of\r\n26,776. There has been a large increase in the capacity and power of\r\nrolling stock. The average freight train load has increased from 131\r\nto 320 tons. Freight train mileage has grown but 35 per cent, while\r\nton mileage has more than tripled. Thus, although the average length\r\nof haul has increased and the average receipts per ton mile have\r\ndiminished, the earnings per freight train mile are actually more than\r\ndouble in 1907 what they were in 1897. And, finally, the Atchison is\r\nnot dependent for its revenue upon any single kind of business. Coal,\r\nore, and other mineral products yielded but 30.87 per cent of its\r\ntonnage in 1907; products of agriculture 25.34 per cent; manufactures\r\n17.37 per cent; and products of the forest 12.12 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe capital account, meanwhile, has been kept from undue expansion. The\r\nfunded debt has increased from $174,196,750 in 1897 to $284,171,550 in\r\n1907, but the capital stock has decreased somewhat, and the greater\r\npart of the new bond issues have been convertible serial debenture\r\nbonds, which occasion no permanent increase in charges. It is within\r\nthe last two years only that Atchison stockholders have authorized\r\nthe issue of new capital on a scale commensurate with the growth of\r\ntheir property. In 1906 $26,060,000 in 4 per cent convertible bonds\r\nwere offered to them at par, and this last year they have authorized\r\nthe issue of $98,000,000 of common stock for improvements, extensions,\r\nand the like. This provides ample facilities for the future without\r\nendangering the solvency of the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nUNION PACIFIC\r\n\r\n  Acts of 1862 and 1864—High cost of construction—Forced combination\r\n    with the Kansas Pacific and the Denver Pacific—Unprofitable\r\n    branches—Adams’s administration—Financial difficulties—Debt to\r\n    the Government—Receivership and reorganization—Later history.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe construction of the Union Pacific was made possible by direct\r\ngrants of lands and government bonds by Congress. The motive for the\r\nproject was military and political as well as economic; on the one hand\r\nCalifornia was to be cemented to the Union, and aggression on the part\r\nof England was to be forestalled; on the other a great and fertile\r\nterritory was to be opened and an additional market provided for the\r\nproducts of the East.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 the first act “to aid in the construction of a Railroad and\r\nTelegraph Line from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean, and to\r\nsecure to the Government the Use of the same for Postal, Military, and\r\nOther Purposes” was passed.[456]. It created a corporation to be known\r\nas the Union Pacific Railroad Company, with a capital of 100,000 shares\r\nof $1000 each, and authorized it to construct a railroad from the one\r\nhundredth meridian of longitude west from Greenwich at a point within\r\nthe territory of Nebraska westward to the western boundary of the\r\nterritory of Nevada. It granted the right of way, and in addition five\r\nadditional sections per mile on each side of the track, plus a varying\r\namount of United States bonds per mile, the use and delivery of which\r\nwas to constitute a first mortgage on the property of the company. All\r\ncompensation for services rendered to the Government was to be applied\r\nto the payment of these bonds and interest thereon; and after the road\r\nwas completed, until the bonds and interest should have been paid, at\r\nleast 5 per cent of the net earnings of the road was to be annually\r\napplied to the payment thereof. The directors were to be not less than\r\nfifteen in number, of whom two were to be appointed by the President\r\nof the United States. It was hoped that the offer would be sufficient\r\nto attract private capital to the undertaking, and when it failed in\r\nthis, the inducements were increased. The Act of 1864 amended that\r\nof 1862. It reduced the par value of the shares of stock from $1000\r\nto $100, and increased their number from 100,000 to 1,000,000. It\r\nincreased the land grant from five to ten alternate sections per mile,\r\nand subordinated the government lien to the rank of a second mortgage.\r\nOnly one-half the compensation for services rendered for the Government\r\nwas required to be applied to the payment of the bonds issued by the\r\nGovernment. The directors were to be twenty in number, of whom five\r\nwere to be appointed by the Federal President.[457]\r\n\r\nIt was under these main provisions that the Union Pacific Railroad was\r\nconstructed. In their final shape they were intended to provide for the\r\ngreater part of the cost of construction, while allowing the company\r\nto supply deficiencies by the issue of its own first mortgage bonds.\r\nCapitalization under these conditions would not have been excessive;\r\nthe Government’s investment would have redounded unmistakably to its\r\nown benefit, as well as to that of the country, and the corporation\r\nwould have looked forward to a long and prosperous career. Three things\r\ninterfered to swell the cost of the construction of the road, and with\r\nthat its capitalization: First, construction was carried on during a\r\ntime of high prices, swollen not only by depreciation of the currency,\r\nbut by artificial conditions occasioned by the war; second, the normal\r\nlevel of the prices paid was raised by the speed with which the road\r\nwas completed; third, construction was entrusted to a construction\r\ncompany, the famous Crédit Mobilier.\r\n\r\nIn its comparison of the prices of the years 1864–9, with those of\r\n1860, the Aldrich Committee arrived, in 1893, at the following result:\r\n\r\n                                              _Metals &\r\n                                              Implements\r\n                      _Bar Iron    _Rails,    exc. Pocket     _All\r\n  _Year_   _Food_      Rolled_      Iron_       Knives_     Articles_\r\n\r\n   1864     165.8       249.3       262.5        198.0        190.5\r\n   1865     216.5       181.1       205.5        218.7        216.8\r\n   1866     173.8       167.0       180.7        192.7        191.0\r\n   1867     163.9       148.2       173.2        178.9        172.2\r\n   1868     164.2       145.8       164.3        167.1        160.5\r\n   1869     162.9       139.0       160.9        157.9        153.5\r\n\r\nThese figures may be divided by the premium on gold, in order roughly\r\nto ascertain gold prices. The index numbers then become:\r\n\r\n                                               _Metals &\r\n                                              Implements\r\n                      _Bar Iron    _Rails,    exc.

Wages were also above the normal, and for\r\nsimilar reasons. During the war the demand for men and goods of all\r\nkinds was great. After 1865 the country turned with tremendous energy\r\nto industry; and the upward swing, which was unchecked until the panic\r\nof 1873, and which was especially directed toward railroad building,\r\nmaintained both wages and prices at an unusual height. Besides this,\r\nAmerican rails were at the time in a period of transition from iron\r\nto steel; and much of the work carried through at such expense had\r\ncompletely to be done over within the next ten years.\r\n\r\nThe high prices were made higher by the speed of construction. The\r\nUnion Pacific built west from the Missouri River, but at the same\r\ntime the Central Pacific was building east from Sacramento, under\r\nsimilar conditions as to government aid. The two roads were expected to\r\nmeet at the western boundary of Nevada; but to encourage their early\r\ncompletion, the Act of 1862 authorized the road which first reached\r\nthe designated point to continue construction, east or west as the\r\ncase might be, until junction with the second road should be made.\r\nSince the amount of land granted depended on the mileage completed, the\r\nhaste of the companies was feverish. “The Union Pacific Company,” says\r\nDavis,[459] “had its parties of graders working 200 miles in advance\r\nof its completed line in places as far west as Humboldt Wells.” The\r\nCentral Pacific had completed 105 miles east of Sacramento by the\r\nautumn of 1867, hauling iron and supplies over the mountains without\r\nwaiting for the piercing of its tunnels. No less than 1038 miles of\r\nthe Union Pacific, including the difficult stretch over the Rocky\r\nMountains, were completed by 1869, four years after construction was\r\ncommenced. The prize of additional land was thereby secured, but this\r\nland was long unsalable, and the cost of construction was largely\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nFinally, large sums were misapplied through a construction company.\r\nThe story of the Crédit Mobilier has been so often told that only\r\nbrief mention need be made of it here.[460] In 1864 T. C. Durant,\r\nvice-president of the Union Pacific, induced one H. M. Hoxie to bid\r\nfor a contract to build from Omaha to the one hundredth meridian.\r\nHoxie was financially irresponsible, and four days later assigned the\r\ncontract to a company composed of Durant and other stockholders of\r\nthe Union Pacific. Meanwhile Durant had purchased the charter of the\r\nPennsylvania Fiscal Agency, a corporation which possessed convenient\r\npowers. Later in 1864 the members of Durant’s construction company\r\nwere given stock in the Fiscal Agency, now called the Crédit Mobilier\r\nof America, for the amounts they had paid in, and stockholders of the\r\nUnion Pacific were allowed to receive Crédit Mobilier stock for the\r\namounts they had paid in on their Union Pacific shares. Stockholders of\r\nthe Union Pacific thus became also stockholders of the Crédit Mobilier,\r\nand in their former capacity were enabled to vote lucrative contracts\r\nto themselves as constructors of the railroad. Durant’s company\r\nassigned its contract to the Crédit Mobilier. Subsequently it was\r\nfound more convenient to assign contracts to certain individuals, who\r\ntransferred them to seven trustees, who built the required road with\r\nfunds furnished by the Crédit Mobilier, and turned over the profits to\r\nthat organization, but the practical result was the same.[461] These\r\nvarious devices removed all incentive to economy on the part of the\r\nUnion Pacific stockholders. Instead of gaining by cheap construction,\r\nthey profited by dear; instead of aiming to reduce the cost in every\r\npossible way, they schemed at making the construction contracts as\r\nlucrative as possible to the persons to whom they were assigned. The\r\nadvantages to them as stockholders of the Crédit Mobilier outweighed\r\nthe disadvantages to them as stockholders of the Union Pacific. The\r\nprofits realized by the Crédit Mobilier are still a subject of dispute.\r\nH. K. White figures them as 27½ per cent, or $16,700,000; Davis\r\nsays that the profit was safely over $20,000,000; but whereas White\r\ncalculates the percentage of profits to the total cost of construction,\r\nDavis insists that a large part of the capital invested was replaced\r\non the completion of each section of twenty miles by the proceeds of\r\nthe government bonds and railway bonds and stock, and that though from\r\n$50,000,000 to $70,000,000 were expended, in all probability not more\r\nthan $10,000,000 were sunk at any one time; in which case a profit\r\nof $20,000,000, spread over four years, represents $5,000,000 per\r\nyear, or 50 per cent annually on the capital employed. Finally, the\r\nUnion Pacific Railway Commission estimated the actual cash profits at\r\n$23,366,320, and remarked that the obligations incurred by the railroad\r\ncompany represented a very much larger sum, being measured by the bonds\r\nand stock at their par values.[462]\r\n\r\nThe result of the three factors was a corporation bonded at an\r\nextremely high rate. The cost of road in 1870 was reported to be\r\n$106,245,978, or $102,951 per mile, against which was a capitalization\r\nof $107,907,300, or $104,561 per mile, of which $32,715 per mile was\r\nstock, $26,080 government bonds, and $45,765 first mortgage, land\r\ngrant, and income bonds. In 1873 the net earnings were $4,092,032, and\r\nthe interest on the funded debt, not including the government interest,\r\nwas $3,403,660. In 1874 the figures were $5,291,243 and $3,431,720;\r\nin other words, the corporation started with a heavy handicap, which\r\nits monopoly of transcontinental business at first helped to overcome,\r\nbut which grew heavier and heavier as the years went on. During\r\nthe seventies, to repeat, the Union Pacific enjoyed generally large\r\nprosperity. The volume of stock outstanding remained the same, the\r\nbonded indebtedness but slightly increased, and the ratio of operating\r\nexpenses to receipts declined. The first dividend was paid in 1875;\r\nin 1876 and 1877 8 per cent was declared, in 1878 5½ per cent, and in\r\n1879 6 per cent. In 1880, however, a consolidation took place with the\r\nKansas Pacific and Denver Pacific railroads, and this operation may\r\nwell receive somewhat detailed consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Kansas Pacific, as well as the Union Pacific, was a creation of\r\nthe Acts of 1862 and 1864, which required it to be constructed from\r\nKansas City westwardly to form a junction with the Union Pacific at a\r\npoint on the one hundredth meridian. Later, an Act of July 3, 1866,\r\nauthorized it to change its route, and to connect with the Union\r\nPacific at a point not more than fifty miles westwardly from the\r\nmeridian of Denver in Colorado.[463] Like the Union Pacific the Kansas\r\nPacific was built by means of construction contracts, which resulted\r\nin a total capitalization on its 638 miles of line of $9,437,950 in\r\nstock and $22,651,000 in bonds, or $14,793 and $33,455 respectively\r\nper mile,—high figures in view of the comparatively level character\r\nof the country traversed.[464] The road was not a paying one. It\r\nwas poorly built and poorly managed, and running parallel with the\r\nUnion Pacific, it had to meet competition of a very bitter kind. The\r\nreport of Mr. Calhoun, expert accountant for the United States Pacific\r\nRailway Commission of 1887, showed that the total receipts of the\r\nroad from 1867 to 1879 had aggregated $9,220,218, while the bond and\r\ninterest account, exclusive of United States interest, had amounted to\r\n$15,745,287; leaving a deficit of $6,525,069, or, including the United\r\nStates accrued interest, of $11,330,772.[465] That is, the Kansas\r\nPacific was in a state of chronic insolvency. In 1874 it was placed\r\nin the hands of receivers, and the following year, by an arrangement\r\nwith its creditors, it funded a considerable amount of overdue\r\ninterest.[466]\r\n\r\nIn 1878 a number of securityholders of the Kansas Pacific got together\r\nin an attempt to reorganize that property, to take it out of receivers’\r\nhands, and to “unite in interest the Kansas Pacific and Union Pacific\r\nRailway Companies.” Twelve large securityholders consented to\r\ncontribute to a common pool or fund holdings of securities taken at\r\na fixed valuation, their interests in the pool to be proportional to\r\nthe amounts of said securities and stock taken at the value referred\r\nto.[467] For the securities deposited they were to receive stock at a\r\nreduced rate: thus for eight shares of old stock they were to receive\r\none share of new; for $2000 unsubordinated income bonds they were\r\nto get ten shares, and for $10,000 subordinated income bonds thirty\r\nshares of new stock.[468] The final result would have been to replace\r\nsecurities with a par value of $17,330,350 by stock with a par of\r\n$4,855,300, and greatly to lighten the burdens upon the road; though\r\nit must be remembered that the $17,330,350 were less than half of the\r\ntotal volume of securities outstanding, that the payment of interest on\r\nmuch of these had been optional only, and that no provision was made\r\nfor the floating debt.\r\n\r\nThe scheme fell through, according to Mr. Gould, who was a party to\r\nthe agreement, because securityholders outside of the pool refused\r\nto consent to so drastic a reduction of their holdings; and at his\r\nsuggestion a consolidated mortgage was substituted for the issues of\r\nstock. This mortgage was for forty years at 6 per cent. The total issue\r\nwas to be for $30,000,000, of which $24,000,000 were to be issued at\r\nonce for the retirement of earlier bond issues and for payment of\r\narrears of interest.[469] Like the previous proposition the scheme\r\ncontemplated a scaling in the principal of the junior securities, and\r\nthe same rates of commutation were retained; but in this case the old\r\nKansas Pacific stock was withdrawn from the operation of the plan, and\r\ncertain reservations were made for other purposes, so that an actual\r\nincrease in indebtedness was finally to result, and even the interest\r\ncharges were certain to increase.[470] For the time being, however, by\r\nforce of the reduction of interest on the funding mortgage in January,\r\n1879, from 10 to 7 per cent, and by the disallowance of some claims for\r\noverdue interest, relief was obtained, while the consolidated mortgage\r\nwas duly issued.\r\n\r\nThe Kansas Pacific ran west to Denver. Between Denver and Cheyenne the\r\nDenver Pacific, 106 miles long, served as a connecting link between\r\nthe larger systems. The Denver Pacific stock was held by the Kansas\r\nPacific, and 29,979 shares of it were pledged in 1877 as part security\r\nfor an issue of 10 per cent funding mortgage bonds.[471] The total\r\nearnings of the Denver Pacific from 1870 to 1879 had been $3,122,141;\r\nthe expenses had been $1,709,477, and the net earnings from operation\r\n$1,412,664, or an average per annum of $141,266; while for the first\r\neight years of that time the annual interest charge had been about\r\n$185,000. The only value of the Denver Pacific stock lay in the\r\ncontrol which it secured over a connecting link between Denver and\r\nCheyenne.[472]\r\n\r\nUnder the conditions of competition existing between the Union\r\nPacific, Kansas Pacific, and Denver Pacific, some sort of agreement or\r\nconsolidation was both desirable and likely. The Kansas Pacific was\r\nentirely dependent on its competitor for access to western business,\r\nand this was soon perceived to be equivalent to continuous bankruptcy.\r\nExtension to Ogden would have removed the dependence; but this, while\r\nto be dreaded by the Union Pacific, was beyond the power of the\r\nKansas Pacific for financial reasons, and no capitalist or group of\r\ncapitalists before 1878 or 1879 seemed interested in the undertaking.\r\nOn the other hand, rates were low, and the very success of its\r\nexclusive policy forced the Union Pacific to meet the competition of a\r\nroad which, with no interest charges to pay, was able to cut all rates\r\nto the very verge of the cost of operation.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1875 there was talk of an agreement whereby the Kansas\r\nPacific was to give up its claims for a pro rate on its Pacific\r\nbusiness in return for a monopoly of the local business of Colorado,\r\nand in connection with the deal was to acquire the Colorado Central\r\nRailroad on issue of $10,000,000 Kansas Pacific stock to parties\r\ndesignated by the Union Pacific Company; but this was never carried\r\nout. In 1878, when Gould began to be interested in the property,\r\na union by means of stock control seemed feasible. Gould’s first\r\npurchases were of bonds, and it was as a bondholder that he entered\r\nthe pool of 1878; but with the purchase of the holdings of the “St.\r\nLouis parties,” he and his friends obtained control of a majority\r\nof Kansas Pacific stock. In fact one of the provisions of the pool\r\nwas that if on the first day of June, 1878, it should be found that\r\nMessrs. Gould, Dillon, and Ames, all large stockholders in the Union\r\nPacific, had not a majority interest in said pool, then they should\r\nhave an option on such an amount of other interest ratably and for cash\r\nas on the basis of the schedule should give them such an interest;\r\nand though this majority did not necessarily involve a majority of\r\nstock, the operations of the pool aided Gould in the acquisition of\r\ncontrol. The union between the Union Pacific and the Kansas Pacific\r\nthus secured was, however, of the frailest kind; for Mr. Gould at no\r\ntime had the permanent interest of either road at heart, and looked\r\nfor his personal profit rather in their struggles than in agreement\r\nbetween them. For this reason, as he bought Kansas Pacific, Gould\r\nsold Union Pacific stock, reducing his holdings from about 200,000 to\r\nabout 27,000 shares.[473] In 1879 the situation of the two roads was\r\nthus much the same as before, and the harmony apparent was of the most\r\nsuperficial kind. One change, however, had taken place to the serious\r\ndisadvantage of the Union Pacific; for the Kansas Pacific, although\r\nstill badly built and dependent upon its rival for an adjustment of\r\nrates sufficiently favorable to let it into the western business, had\r\nnow interested in it a group of capitalists quite capable of financing\r\nan extension to Ogden, and even of securing connections from Kansas\r\nCity to the East.\r\n\r\nIn 1879, doubtless relying upon the strength of Kansas Pacific’s new\r\nbacking, Gould proposed to the Union Pacific a consolidation of the\r\nUnion, Kansas, and Denver Pacific roads, in which the shares of each\r\nwere to figure equally at par. The terms were absurd by every test of\r\nproductive capacity which could have been applied. The relative earning\r\npower and annual interest per mile of the three roads at this time were\r\ngiven by a government accountant as follows:\r\n\r\n                    _Annual Net       _Annual Interest\r\n                 Earnings per mile_       per mile_\r\n\r\n  Union Pacific        $5617                $3185\r\n  Kansas Pacific        1602                 2295\r\n  Denver Pacific        1333                 1750[474]\r\n\r\nThe Union Pacific had reported an annual surplus, the other two roads\r\nan annual deficit; the Union Pacific had not defaulted, the Kansas and\r\nDenver Pacific had done little else; the highest mark which the Kansas\r\nPacific stock had touched in January, 1879, had been 13, that of the\r\nUnion Pacific had been 68½. But the question, as Gould well knew, was\r\nnot one of productive but one of destructive capacity, and the means\r\nof coercion which he employed was a demonstration of the ease with\r\nwhich the Kansas Pacific could be made formidable as a competing line.\r\nIn November, 1879, he purchased the Missouri Pacific from Kansas City\r\nto St. Louis; about the same time he bought two minor roads between\r\nthe Kansas Pacific and the Union Pacific in Kansas, and announced his\r\nintention of extending the Kansas Pacific to Salt Lake City, there to\r\nconnect with the Central Pacific and to form a third transcontinental\r\nroute. The story is clearly told in the report of the United States\r\nPacific Railway Commission.[475] The result was the consent of the\r\nUnion Pacific directors to the terms imposed, and the execution of an\r\nagreement dated January 14, 1880, whereby the Union and the Kansas\r\nPacific, with all their respective assets and liabilities, were put\r\ntogether at par of their respective capitals,—$36,762,300 and\r\n$10,000,000,—to which was added the capital of the Denver Pacific,\r\n$4,000,000, forming a new company called the Union Pacific Railway\r\nCompany, with a capital of $50,762,300, and a bonded indebtedness of\r\n$92,984,624.[476] This corporation was larger in every way than the old\r\nUnion Pacific Railroad, except in one particular—earnings above fixed\r\ncharges. It had 1821 miles of line instead of 1042; $22,455,134 gross\r\nearnings instead of $13,201,077; $10,545,119 operating expenses instead\r\nof $5,475,503; and yet, since the consolidation was a union of some\r\nstrength with a vast deal of weakness, there were few who profited by\r\nit save the holders of Kansas Pacific or Denver Pacific stocks. Those\r\nlucky and skilful individuals saw the quotations of Kansas Pacific\r\ncommon rise from a high level of 13 in January, 1879, to one of 59 in\r\nJune, and of 92½ in December; and the stock which had been a football\r\nin the market thus become of such value that in 1887 Gould was able\r\nto lay before a committee of Congress, in justification of the terms\r\ndescribed, a table which showed for 1880 market prices of Kansas and\r\nUnion Pacific stock which were approximately the same.[477]\r\n\r\nIt was to Gould, as chief owner of Kansas Pacific and holder of\r\npractically all of the Denver Pacific stock outstanding, that the\r\nlion’s share of the profits went; but Mr. Gould was not satisfied\r\nwith a harvest on these stocks alone. In the course of his operations\r\nhe had become possessed of certain branch and minor roads in whole\r\nor in part. Thus he held $945,887 in bonds of a company known as the\r\nSt. Joseph & Western Railroad Company, and 5013 shares of its stock;\r\n$634,000 in bonds of the St. Joseph Bridge Company; and $59,000 in\r\nSt. Joseph & Denver Pacific Railroad receivers’ certificates; while\r\nto convince the Union Pacific directors of the wisdom of accepting\r\nhis plan of consolidation he had acquired the Missouri Pacific, the\r\nKansas Central, and the Central Branch Union Pacific railroads.[478]\r\nThe earning capacity of none of these lines was large, that of the\r\nMissouri Pacific being the greatest. The St. Joseph & Western had\r\nbeen sold in foreclosure in 1875, and had continued to be managed\r\nthereafter by a receiver. What value it had was due to the fact that,\r\nas extended to Grand Island, it gave to the Union Pacific an outlet\r\nto the East other than the one at Omaha. The value of the Bridge\r\nCompany bonds and of the receivers’ certificates was dependent upon\r\nthis same property. The Kansas Central was a narrow-gauge road and\r\nhad been sold under foreclosure in April, 1879. The Central Branch\r\nUnion Pacific had been designed to join with the Kansas Pacific, but\r\nhad been left without western connection when this latter road had\r\nfailed to meet the Union Pacific at the hundredth meridian. At the\r\ntime of the consolidation, according to the United States Pacific\r\nRailway Commission, “the coupons for six years were in default, and\r\nwere retained uncancelled as security for the income mortgage. The\r\ncompany had never earned sufficient to pay its own coupons, without\r\ntaking into account the accruing interest to the United States in any\r\nform.”[479] The Missouri Pacific was more prosperous, but need not here\r\nconcern us. Mr. Gould had paid various prices for the above, ranging\r\nfrom $40 for the St. Joseph & Denver bonds to $238 for the stock of\r\nthe Central Branch Union Pacific. In the case of each road he turned\r\nover his purchase to the Union Pacific for the same or a greater\r\nprice.[480] Thus for the St. Joseph & Western bonds, for which he had\r\npaid 40, he received par in Union Pacific stock selling as high as 94\r\nin January, 1880; for $634,000 bonds and 4000 shares of stock of the\r\nSt. Joseph Bridge Company, costing $480,440, he received 6340 shares\r\nof Union Pacific stock; for $479,000 in bonds and 2521 shares of stock\r\nof the Kansas Central, he received 4790 shares of Union Pacific; and\r\nfor 7616 shares of Central Branch Union Pacific, costing $1,826,500,\r\nhe received $913,500 in Union Pacific six per cent bonds and $913,500\r\nin Kansas Pacific six per cent bonds.[481] The result was the issue\r\nof considerable amounts of stock of the consolidated and bonds of the\r\nconsolidating companies, without equivalent value received.\r\n\r\nThe Union Pacific Railway Company, therefore, began its career in\r\n1880 in worse shape than the Union Pacific Railroad Company, which\r\nhad preceded it, for it suffered not only from an initial watering of\r\nstocks and bonds, but from a watering of assets which had followed.\r\nIncluding the government subsidy and accrued interest thereon, the\r\ntotal bonds and stocks of the company in 1880 were $179,058,902, or\r\n$98,329 per mile, of which $27,876 were stock, $45,372 mortgage bonds,\r\nand $25,081 government subsidy and interest. The figures per mile were\r\nslightly lower than in 1870, and yet the water in the capitalization\r\nwas more abundant, for the average value of the assets had declined\r\nstill more. A dividend-paying road had been combined with non-dividend\r\npayers, with the result of large profits to the promoters of the\r\nconsolidations, but of serious harm to the solvent party.\r\n\r\nBetween 1880 and 1883 a number of branches were constructed, to provide\r\nfunds for which the capital stock of the Railway Company was increased\r\n$10,000,000. Of these the Denver & South Park was constructed in the\r\nyears 1881 to 1883, and was the last of Mr. Gould’s gifts to the\r\nparent line. This road was handled by several construction companies,\r\nin the last of which Gould took a quarter interest, receiving stock\r\nof the Denver & South Park Railroad Company as a dividend on his\r\ninvestment.[482] In November, 1880, acting in behalf of the Union\r\nPacific Railway Company, he bought the stock of the Denver road at par\r\nfor cash, benefiting in his capacity as quarter owner by his action as\r\nrepresentative and stockholder of the Union Pacific.[483] In relation\r\nto the road Mr. Charles F. Adams, Jr., subsequently said: “The chief\r\nsource of revenue ... was in carrying men and material into Colorado\r\nto dig holes in the ground called mines, and until it was discovered\r\nthat there was nothing in those mines the business was immense.”[484]\r\nA more important and genuinely beneficial project was the organization\r\nin 1881 of the Oregon Short Line Railway Company to construct and\r\noperate a railway from Granger on the Union Pacific to and into the\r\nstate of Oregon, a distance of 610 miles, with the intention of\r\nsecuring the Washington and Oregon business. The Northern Pacific was\r\nin financial difficulties at the time, and it was not expected that it\r\ncould anticipate the new road; but even though this expectation was\r\ndisappointed, and the Oregon Short Line was second in reaching the\r\ndisputed territory, its value was great and steadily grew.[485] The\r\nroad was built by the construction department of the Union Pacific,\r\nand was financed by the organization of a subsidiary corporation which\r\nissued stock and bonds to an amount of $25,000 per mile, one-half of\r\nthe stock being reserved in the Union Pacific treasury for the purpose\r\nof control, and the Union Pacific guaranteeing the payment of interest\r\non the bonds. This branch at least was not unloaded on the main line by\r\ninterested parties, and forms an essential part of the system to-day.\r\nOther branches were bought or constructed at the time, but do not\r\nrequire detailed mention.\r\n\r\nGould for the time had obtained from the Union Pacific all that he\r\nthought possible, and quietly unloaded his stock, while keeping up the\r\npayment of dividends. By 1883 he was substantially clear, but he had\r\nleft his mark; the consolidation of 1880, with the forced purchase of\r\nworthless branches, aided as it was by the high capitalization caused\r\nby extravagant original construction, and accompanied by a steadily\r\nincreasing intensity of competition between transcontinental lines,\r\nhad diminished the surplus to a dangerous extent. At the same time the\r\nprosperity of the country as a whole was declining; the wheat crop of\r\n1881 was only three-quarters as large as the crop of 1880, and the corn\r\ncrop was the smallest since 1874; though the decline was not so marked\r\nin Kansas and the far West as in the states east and south of Omaha and\r\nKansas. By 1882, says Noyes, all the markets were moving downward, and\r\nafter the reaction of that year, the volume of internal trade decreased\r\ncontinuously until after the panic of 1884.[486]\r\n\r\nThe evidence of distress on the part of the Union Pacific was the\r\nmounting up of the floating debt. In November, 1882, President Dillon\r\nstated that it then amounted to $3,400,000, and that a loan of\r\n$5,000,000 was to be negotiated to take care of it.[487] The annual\r\nreport at the end of the year stated the net debt to be only $842,743,\r\nbut included in the assets used to offset the gross debt $2,768,437 in\r\nfuel and material on hand, and $927,648 in balances due from auxiliary\r\nroads; so that early the following year it was again a subject of\r\ndiscussion, and the stockholders recommended to the directors the\r\nissue of collateral bonds in order to wipe it out. Pursuant to the\r\nrecommendation the directors executed to the New England Trust Company\r\nof Boston an indenture under which it proposed to issue trust bonds to\r\nan amount equal to 90 per cent of the securities deposited. By 1884 the\r\ngross floating debt amounted, nevertheless, to $11,306,595, as against\r\n$9,852,325 gross in 1882, and the quick assets, exclusive of fuel and\r\nmaterial, counted up to $8,068,898, instead of to $6,241,145. The chief\r\nincrease in liabilities, as always, had taken place in bills payable,\r\nmeaning that the road had been giving its notes for the payment of\r\ncurrent indebtedness, with the consequent necessity of paying a high\r\nrate of interest, and of making frequent renewals. Meanwhile dividends\r\nhad been stopped and salaries cut down.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Mr. Sidney Dillon resigned the presidency, and Mr.\r\nCharles Francis Adams, Jr., was elected his successor. Mr. Dillon was\r\nwell along in years, was said to be in poor health, and doubtless\r\nmissed the support which Mr. Gould had been accustomed to render him.\r\nMr. Adams was a younger man, only forty-nine years of age as against\r\nthe sixty-nine of Mr. Dillon. He had been a member of the Massachusetts\r\nRailway Commission from 1869 to 1879, had served as government director\r\nof the Union Pacific in 1878, and now brought to his position as\r\npresident an inexhaustible fund of energy, large resourcefulness,\r\nand more important still, a nice sense of his obligations towards\r\nthe bondholders and shareholders of his road. Under his régime the\r\neconomies earlier initiated were continued and extended; employees were\r\ndischarged until, by June 28, 1884, the company had only about 10,000\r\nmen in its employ instead of the 20,000 who had been on the rolls at\r\none time; and rolling mills, etc., were closed wherever the company\r\nfound it cheaper to purchase rails and equipment at current prices.\r\nThis, with the cessation of dividends, left a considerable surplus\r\nrevenue applicable to the payment of the floating debt. In addition,\r\nbonds and stock from the company’s treasury were sold between January\r\n1, 1884, and January 1, 1887, for which $6,550,000 were obtained; and\r\nthe aggregate of resources made available was $16,200,000, of which\r\n$8,251,368 were applied to the floating debt, $6,708,632 to betterment\r\nof the road and branch-line construction, and $1,240,000 to increase of\r\nequipment.[488] In addition the proceeds from land sales were used to\r\nthe same general end. In August, to reassure investors, President Adams\r\nstated that no part of the floating debt was pressing, and in November\r\nhe repeated the statement; the truth of which was made evident by the\r\npayment of the last bit of net unfunded indebtedness on August 22, two\r\nyears later. The result was highly creditable, although the continued\r\ncessation of dividends provoked some protest.\r\n\r\nMuch could be done at this time by able and energetic management; there\r\nwas, however, much that could not be done; and it is to this that we\r\nmust attribute Mr. Adams’s failure to put the road in a permanently\r\nstable position. For first, the competition which the Union Pacific\r\nwas obliged to meet was constantly increasing in severity. In 1881\r\nthe Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe was extended to a junction with the\r\nSouthern Pacific at Deming; in 1883, in the language of the annual\r\nreport, “Not only was the Rio Grande completed to Ogden, making, in\r\nconnection with the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe and the Burlington\r\n& Missouri extension of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy, a direct\r\ncompeting route with the Union Pacific from Chicago and all eastern\r\npoints to a common western terminus, but the Northern Pacific also was\r\nconnected through, making a third transcontinental route.”[489] In 1887\r\nthe Atchison built 450 miles of line and the Chicago, Rock Island &\r\nPacific was scarcely behind, so that Kansas and Nebraska were covered\r\nwith a network of lines, which transformed the natural local traffic of\r\nthe Union Pacific into competitive business of the most uncertain kind.\r\nAt the same time the profitable high grade business was giving way to\r\na larger volume of mineral traffic, and the average length of haul was\r\nincreasing, all of which resulted in a decrease of about 45 per cent\r\nin the average receipts per ton mile between 1881 and 1890, a slow\r\nincrease in gross earnings which bore little relation to the greatly\r\nincreased volume of business done, and a fluctuating progress of net\r\nearnings, which were actually over $3,000,000 less in 1889 than they\r\nhad been eight years before.\r\n\r\nAnd second, during this time the fixed charges of the Union Pacific\r\ndid not materially decrease. They were $7,626,626 when Mr. Adams\r\nassumed the presidency, and $7,309,142 five years later; and the\r\nnecessity for further decrease was shown by the fact that the total\r\nnet income of the road was $11,402,199 in 1884, $10,339,402 in 1889,\r\nand $9,561,673 in 1890. What Mr. Adams could do he did, and the funded\r\ndebt under his régime decreased from $90,760,582 in 1884 to $82,090,585\r\nin 1889, and to $73,968,885 in 1890; the company steadily buying up\r\nits own indebtedness: but the conditions which he had to face were too\r\nexacting, and the saving made here was offset in other ways.\r\n\r\nTo save itself the Union Pacific was driven to a rapid extension of\r\nits branch mileage, which Mr. Adams held to be the only means by which\r\nfixed charges could be paid.[490] Between 1884 and 1890 3132.45 miles\r\nwere built or acquired, all under separate organizations, but with\r\ntheir accounts and management under the supervision and control of the\r\nofficers of the parent line; and the amount invested in branch-line\r\nsecurities was raised from about $28,000,000 in 1881 to $41,879,724 in\r\n1892. These roads reported annual deficits, which were either paid out\r\nof earnings or carried as floating debt. The report of the Government\r\nDirectors in 1891 declared that $15,000,000 out of $21,400,000 of\r\nfloating debt were the result of expenditures and advances in the\r\nconstruction of branch and tributary lines and the purchase of stock in\r\nsuch lines for the purpose of control.[491] But speaking in 1887, Mr.\r\nAdams declared the branches to be worth $5,000,000 a year to the main\r\nline, entirely apart from anything which appeared in the accounts of\r\nthe branches themselves, and in a letter to the Government Directors in\r\n1884 he said: “The branches and auxiliary lines of the Union Pacific\r\nshould be considered the only real security the Government has for the\r\nrepayment of its indebtedness.... Were it not for these branches the\r\nUnion Pacific would be confined to such small local traffic as it could\r\npick up at points directly upon its main line; and to its share of the\r\nthrough transcontinental business which has recently been subdivided\r\nby four through the construction of competing routes.”[492] The most\r\nimportant of the branches remained the Oregon Short Line, with the\r\nconnecting line of the Oregon Railway & Navigation Company, of which\r\nthe Union Pacific became finally possessed in 1889. This last road had\r\nbeen long considered the natural outlet of the Northern Pacific to the\r\nPacific coast, but had been leased by the Union Pacific in 1887 through\r\nthe Oregon Short Line with a guarantee of 6 per cent dividends upon\r\nits stock as well as interest upon its bonds for 999 years. In 1889\r\nnegotiations with the Northern Pacific resulted finally in the sale\r\nof the Oregon Railway & Navigation stock held by Mr. Villard and his\r\nfriends. Pending the issue of a collateral trust mortgage the stock\r\nwas deposited with a trust company, a note was given for the amount,\r\nand the sum was carried as floating debt. Whatever the value of the\r\nproperty to the Northern Pacific, it proved of great worth to the Union\r\nPacific, providing it with an independent outlet to the coast, and\r\ngiving it a haul on its main line of over 800 miles on all interchanged\r\ntraffic. The method of payment proved a dangerous one, however, in\r\nthat it so largely swelled the volume of the Union Pacific’s quick\r\nliabilities.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 Mr. Gould again began buying Union Pacific stock. Mr. Adams\r\ntherefore resigned late in the year, and Mr. Dillon was elected to\r\nhis position. The time was not ripe for expansion of any kind, and\r\nMr. Gould’s death the following year put an effectual check on any\r\nschemes which he might have entertained. The immediate problem was the\r\nfloating debt, swollen to unwieldy proportions by the acquisition of\r\nbranch lines, and in particular by the purchase of the Oregon Railway\r\n& Navigation Company. During 1890 a block of collateral bonds was\r\nissued and sold, but the remainder of the proposed issue was kept\r\nback in the hope of a better price. While waiting, Mr. Gould devised\r\na scheme for the postponement of the payment of these and of other\r\nquick liabilities by the issue of three-year collateral notes, to be\r\nunderwritten by a syndicate composed of himself and of other gentlemen\r\ninterested in the property. These notes were to bear 6 per cent, and\r\nwere to be issued at 92½ to such holders of the floating debt as would\r\naccept them, the syndicate taking care of the balance. The authorized\r\namount was to be $24,000,000, of which $5,500,000 were to be issued at\r\nonce. The plan was declared operative on September 28, 1891. If, now,\r\nthe Union Pacific had been a moderately capitalized corporation, with\r\nfixed charges normally well below its earning capacity, and if, in\r\n1894, when the notes were to mature, the market conditions had been\r\nmore favorable than in 1891, it is probable that this scheme, temporary\r\nas it was, would have met the needs of the situation. Since neither\r\nof these contingencies occurred the insufficiency of the plan may be\r\nsaid to be in part the misfortune of the Union Pacific and in part its\r\nfault. It was a particular misfortune that the severest panic since\r\n1873 should occur when the road was staggering under a load which it\r\ncould scarcely bear; but it was altogether a fault that the railroad\r\nshould have been so burdened as to be able to lay by no reserve in good\r\ntimes for the hard times which were bound to come.\r\n\r\nIn 1892, therefore, the Union Pacific was in a difficult position. Its\r\ncapitalization was high; its earnings had shown scarcely any increase\r\nfor five years; its surplus had not been sufficient to prevent the\r\naccumulation of a large floating debt; it had to prepare to raise a\r\nlarge sum of money in two years for the payment of its short time\r\nnotes; and, in addition, there was ahead a fact of which little has\r\nbeen said so far,—the maturing of the government indebtedness.\r\n\r\nBriefly sketched, the history of this indebtedness was as follows:\r\nThe Acts of 1862 and 1864 had provided for the issue of government\r\nbonds for stated amounts per mile on the subsidized portions of the\r\nsystem in aid of construction, which bonds were to mature thirty years\r\nfrom date of issue, and to have a lien on the property covered second\r\nonly to the first mortgage of the company. The rate of interest was 6\r\nper cent, payable to the bondholders by the Government; and in 1875\r\nthe Supreme Court decided that the company was not obliged to repay\r\nto the Government the accruing interest before the maturity of the\r\nbonds.[493] This ruling was regarded as a victory for the company, but\r\nmeant the steady piling up of arrears of interest, lessened only by the\r\nretention by the Government of one-half the amounts due for government\r\ntransportation, and, under the Thurman Act, of such additional sum\r\nnot in excess of $850,000 as, added to the whole compensation for\r\ngovernment services and to the 5 per cent of net earnings set aside\r\nunder the Act of 1862, should make the annual contribution equal to\r\n25 per cent of the net earnings of the company, unless the remaining\r\n75 per cent should be insufficient to pay the interest on the first\r\nmortgage bonds; in which case the Secretary of the Treasury was\r\nauthorized to remit a portion of the 25 per cent of net earnings\r\nrequired.[494] The Thurman Act did not fulfil expectations. The Supreme\r\nCourt in 1891 held that expenditures for new construction and new\r\nequipment could not be deducted from gross earnings in ascertaining\r\nnet earnings,[495] but the road met hard times and the maximum limit\r\nof the contributions to the sinking fund was not attained, and in\r\ninvesting the fund in government bonds the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nwas compelled to pay high premiums, thus reducing the net interest;\r\nso that from the beginning to 1892 the question of indebtedness to\r\nthe Government occasioned constant dispute and litigation, introduced\r\nuncertainty into the affairs of the railroad, and caused hard feelings\r\nbetween it and the Government. In 1892 the necessity for some\r\nsettlement was near at hand. The principal of the government debt\r\nmatured as follows:\r\n\r\n  November 1, 1895     $640,000\r\n  January  1, 1896    1,440,000\r\n  February 1, 1896    4,320,000\r\n  January  1, 1897    6,640,000\r\n  January  1, 1898   17,342,512\r\n  January  1, 1899    3,157,000\r\n                    -----------\r\n                    $33,539,512\r\n\r\nDeducting from this amount the sums paid to the Government and\r\nthe company’s credits for mail and carriage, and adding arrears\r\nof interest, the sum due the Government at the last of 1893 was\r\napproximately $52,000,000.[496] It was obviously highly difficult for\r\nthe company to pay this sum in 1892 or 1898 or any other time, and\r\nfor some years both the company and the Government had been earnestly\r\ndiscussing schemes for refunding, and the advantages and disadvantages\r\nof the ownership and operation of the road by the United States.\r\nThus in 1892 an overwhelming obligation was hanging over the Union\r\nPacific; and did not crush it only because the inability of the road\r\nto pay was so evident, and the inadvisability of government ownership\r\nwas so strongly believed in, that every one felt that the necessary\r\nconcessions would be made.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 the sinking-fund 8 per cent bonds matured to the amount of\r\n$5,176,000, and were partially extended and partially paid off through\r\nthe medium of an underwriting syndicate; but this was the last attempt\r\nto meet indebtedness coming due. During the year both gross and net\r\nearnings fell off enormously, owing to the general depression of\r\nbusiness, and particularly to the stagnation upon the Pacific coast.\r\nFreight rates were said to be in a state of chaos; and the Union\r\nPacific served notice that it would withdraw from the Western Passenger\r\nAssociation on October 10. As the year wore on the continued decrease\r\nin earnings made the situation desperate. “The company for the year\r\nending December 31, 1892,” said Mr. John F. Dillon, counsel for the\r\nUnion Pacific, in November, “had a surplus of $2,000,000. In the month\r\nof September (1893) there was a loss of net revenue of $1,500,000 as\r\ncompared with the preceding year, and from January 1 to August 31\r\nthere has been a falling off in net revenue of over $2,500,000. The\r\ncompany is indebted for labor and materials on October 1 to the amount\r\nof $1,500,000; and its sinking-fund and interest charges for September\r\nwould be more than $1,000,000; for October $750,000, for November\r\n$850,000, for December $1,000,000, and for January $1,000,000. There\r\nwill be a deficit for the year 1893 of at least $3,000,000 and the\r\ncompany is without money or means to meet these obligations....”[497]\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions a receivership was the only device which could\r\nprevent the dismemberment of the system and protect the interests of\r\nall the creditors; and accordingly, on application of parties friendly\r\nto the company, Messrs. S. H. Clark (president of the Union Pacific),\r\nO. W. Mink (comptroller), and E. E. Anderson (government director),\r\nwere appointed in October;[498] Mr. Clark taking charge of the\r\noperation of the road, and Messrs. Mink and Anderson of the financial\r\nand legal business.[499] One month later, on application of the\r\nAttorney-General, Messrs. John W. Doane and Frederick R. Coudert were\r\nappointed additional receivers to safeguard the government interests\r\nand to assist the other receivers in the general administration of\r\nthe property.[500] These gentlemen remained in office until the\r\nreorganization was complete, though various portions of the system\r\npassed from their jurisdiction from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of receivers closed a long struggle to maintain the\r\nsolvency of the road. A reorganization was now in order, and in this\r\nit was to be possible to do what Mr. Adams had not been able to\r\ndo,—namely, to rearrange the capitalization of the road, thereby\r\npermanently lessening the fixed charges and securing a reserve of\r\nearning capacity sufficient to avoid bankruptcy when receipts for any\r\ncause should show a considerable decrease. This was the fundamental\r\ncondition of future prosperity. Besides, the debt to the Government\r\nhad to be settled, cash raised to pay the floating debt, including the\r\nthree-year notes of 1891, and the system held together so that its\r\nearning capacity should not be destroyed.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, it was the debt to the Government which was most\r\npublicly and persistently discussed. There seemed to be four ways in\r\nwhich this might be handled:\r\n\r\nFirst, the Government might have cancelled the obligation and have\r\nremained satisfied with the enormous economies which it had secured\r\nin the transportation of mails and other government business. In the\r\nseven years between 1867 and 1873 alone the Quartermaster-General\r\nestimated that the Union Pacific had saved the Government $6,507,283\r\nin the cost of moving troops and supplies,[501] and there was no doubt\r\nthat by 1896 the investment of the Government, with interest, had\r\nbeen many times regained. But it was pointed out not only that the\r\nUnion Pacific deserved little consideration, in that its earnings had\r\nbeen wrongfully diverted from the payments demanded by the Thurman\r\nAct by the manipulations of Gould and others, but that the precedent\r\nof renouncing a just claim would be an extremely bad one for the\r\nGovernment to set.\r\n\r\nSecond, the Government might have exacted larger payments to the\r\nsinking fund, and have extended the debt at an unchanged rate of\r\ninterest until it should be automatically discharged. This was the\r\nproposal of Mr. Hampton, Commissioner of Railroads, who suggested\r\nthe amendment of the Thurman Act as follows: it should embrace all\r\nthe United States bond-aided Pacific railroads; it should compel the\r\ncontribution of 50 per cent of net earnings to a sinking fund instead\r\nof 25 per cent, and should extend the indebtedness to the Government\r\nuntil discharged as provided. If any company should abandon a portion\r\nof a subsidized line or divert its business from a subsidized to an\r\nunsubsidized line, that company should transfer the conditions which\r\nwere attached to the former to the latter, in order to protect the\r\ninterests of the United States Government.[502] The weak points in\r\nthis scheme were many. Among them may be pointed out the fact that\r\ncontributions to the sinking fund under the Thurman Act had been\r\nnecessarily invested in government bonds, which, in view of the premium\r\nat which they were necessarily purchased, yielded a very small return.\r\nTo double the contributions would have been to double the amount of the\r\nrailroad’s funds sunk in but slightly remunerative investments; and the\r\nGovernment did not seem inclined to permit the company to adopt the\r\nonly practicable alternative, that of investing its sinking fund in its\r\nown securities. Also, Mr. Hampton’s amendment would have continued to\r\nan enhanced degree the constant suspicious supervision of the company\r\nby the Government which had been, perhaps, the chief evil result of the\r\nThurman Act.\r\n\r\nThird, the Government might have consented to a refunding of the\r\nindebtedness to it at a lower rate of interest. This was most urgently\r\npressed by representatives of the road. Mr. A. A. H. Boissevain,\r\nrepresenting the Dutch bondholders, proposed to redeem the first\r\nmortgage by the securities in the sinking fund so far as possible,\r\nand to renew the rest at a lower rate of interest;—after which\r\nthe Government was to be given a 100-year 2 per cent bond for the\r\nprincipal and interest of its claim.[503] Attorney-General Olney\r\nsimilarly suggested a renewal of the first mortgage bonds at a rate of\r\nnot over 5 per cent, and an exchange of 100-year 2 per cent bonds for\r\nthe government claim; though he differed somewhat from Mr. Boissevain\r\nas to the lien which these bonds should have.[504] Congress and the\r\nGovernment Directors in 1894 were inclined to insist on harder terms.\r\nThe latter, in their annual report, proposed that the first mortgage\r\nbonds be paid off in cash, and that a 100-year 3 per cent instead of a\r\n2 per cent bond be given to the Government, with elaborate provision\r\nfor a sinking fund; and the former had before it in the Reilly Bill\r\na very similar suggestion.[505] As a counter-proposition the railway\r\ncompany offered to pay off the first mortgage bonds in cash if the\r\nGovernment would take a 50-year 2 per cent instead of a 3 per cent\r\nbond for its claim. “The petitioners further represent,” it said,\r\n“that it will be utterly impossible to obtain the very large sums\r\nreferred to from the stockholders unless it be possible to offer to\r\nthem in satisfaction of their assessments reasonable security for the\r\nmoneys so advanced. At a meeting recently held, at which were present\r\nrepresentatives of a large amount of the stock of the said company,\r\nthe conclusion was reached that if the debt to the Government could be\r\nfunded substantially on the terms of the Reilly Bill, but at a rate\r\nof interest of 2 per cent per annum instead of 3 per cent, the said\r\nstockholders would endeavor to raise the funds needed for the purpose\r\nof meeting the requirements of the Reilly Bill.”[506] Finally, Mr.\r\nPierce, on behalf of the Fitzgerald Reorganization Committee, proposed\r\nthat the Government either take 4 per cent bonds for the principal\r\nof its debt, and preferred stock for the interest, carrying into\r\nthe settlement with the Government the scheme which was found best\r\nadapted to the satisfaction of other creditors; or that it take a 3\r\nper cent first mortgage bond for its principal, and a second mortgage\r\nnon-interest-bearing bond for its interest; or that it accept a lump\r\nsum of money equal to the value of its lien, which he informally\r\nestimated as 50 per cent of the total amount due.[507] The plan of\r\nrefunding was the most obvious as well as the most practicable of\r\nall suggestions. It had, however, the disadvantage from the point of\r\nview of the Government of surrendering some part of the government\r\nclaim, and from that of the company of continuing the relations of the\r\nGovernment with the road.\r\n\r\nFourth and last, the Government might have demanded payment in cash.\r\nThe sum which the company would have had to obtain was extremely large,\r\nbut the accumulated sinking fund reduced it considerably, and many\r\nthought that the balance could be raised. In March, 1896, before a\r\nSenate committee, Mr. John Rooney, for the first mortgage bondholders,\r\nproposed that the Government, through a commission, should buy in\r\nthe Union Pacific at foreclosure sale, should issue a new general\r\nmortgage at a lower rate of interest than the existing prior liens,\r\nand should pay off both the first and the government mortgage with the\r\nproceeds;—the road to be turned over to the subscribers.[508] This\r\nsuggestion took place among many others which were in the nature of\r\na compromise. Thus the reorganization committee, in 1895, offered to\r\npay the principal of the government debt provided that the interest\r\nwere cancelled;[509] and Receiver Anderson proposed in 1896 that the\r\ncompany pay the principal of the debt by adding funds raised by it to\r\nthe amount of the sinking fund, and settle the arrears of interest with\r\na 50-year 2 per cent bond. Full payment in cash was, of course, what\r\nthe Government desired, and everything short of that it hesitated to\r\naccept; but equally, of course, full payment was what the bondholders\r\nof the road were most unwilling to concede; and hearing after hearing\r\ntook place before committees of the Senate and of the House without\r\ndefinite result.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the general reorganization of the company was going on.\r\nIn November, 1893, the various interests and factions of the road\r\nheld a conference in New York, which resulted in the choice of a\r\nreorganization committee as follows: Senator Brice, chairman; Mr.\r\nA. H. Boissevain, for the foreign holders; General Louis Fitzgerald,\r\npresident of the Mercantile Trust Company, for the Gould interests;\r\nMr. Carr, for the estate of F. L. Ames; General Dodge, for the Denver\r\nand Gulf roads’ interests; and Colonel H. L. Higginson, for the Oregon\r\nRailway & Navigation interests.[510] Subsequently Mr. J. P. Morgan\r\naccepted a place.[511] This committee was the only comprehensive\r\none appointed until 1895; but numerous other committees sprang up\r\nto represent special interests of one kind or another, appearing\r\nfrequently as interest on new classes of bonds was defaulted, and\r\nhaving, with the main reorganization committee, to deal specifically\r\nwith the payment of the floating debt and the reduction of fixed\r\ncharges. Upon the ability of the committees to agree depended the\r\nretention of the Union Pacific in something like its existing shape.\r\n\r\nAside from the question of the government debt there seemed to be a\r\ngeneral agreement as to what was needed to be done. Every suggestion\r\ncontemplated the payment of the first mortgage in full and the\r\nreduction of the interest upon the junior securities; most included\r\nwith this an assessment on the stock, and one at least proposed the\r\ncancellation of the guarantee on the stock of the Oregon Railway &\r\nNavigation Company.[512] The principles were obvious. A large sum of\r\nmoney had to be raised with which to pay the floating debt and to meet\r\npossible demands by the Government. This had to come from the junior\r\nsecurities or from the stock, and preferably from the stock, which\r\nrepresented ownership in the enterprise. On the other hand, reductions\r\nin fixed charges had to come from the junior securities as the youngest\r\ninterests which had a mortgage lien. Differences of opinion occurred\r\nupon the details. Should there or should there not be a foreclosure?\r\nHow large an assessment was required? How great must the reduction in\r\ninterest charges be, and should bonds or stock or both be given to the\r\njunior securities in exchange for their holdings? Should the system as\r\nit stood be preserved, or should certain parts of it be let go?\r\n\r\nIn June, 1894, Mr. Boissevain stated that the reorganization committee\r\nthought that they should be in a position to formulate a complete\r\nplan of reorganization speedily after the terms of the adjustment of\r\nthe debt to the United States had been approved by Congress. “It is\r\nour opinion that the fixed charges of the reorganized company ...\r\nshould not exceed $8,500,000 per annum. Certain classes of existing\r\nbonds secured by mortgage on portions of the system cannot be and\r\nshould not be disturbed, as they are amply secured by property earning\r\nthe interest which is payable thereon. Other bonds, however, must be\r\nconverted in whole or in part into securities not imposing a fixed\r\ncharge upon the reorganized company. While the reorganization committee\r\nhas not approved of any definite plan, we believe that holders of bonds\r\nwhich must be disturbed and creditors and stockholders interested in\r\nthe system can be provided for upon an equitable basis by the creation\r\nof the following securities:\r\n\r\n(_a_) An issue of general mortgage bonds (at 4 per cent), secured by a\r\ngeneral mortgage covering the entire system, subject to such mortgages\r\nas cannot be disturbed, and to the lien of the United States upon the\r\nmain line and Kansas Pacific division for the adjusted debt.\r\n\r\n(_b_) An issue of 5 per cent preferred stock.\r\n\r\n(_c_) An issue of common stock.\r\n\r\nThe plan of reorganization would require provision to be made to\r\ntake up the trust notes secured by valuable collaterals. The funds\r\nrequired for this purpose and for the other cash requirements of the\r\nreorganization would be met in part by a reasonable assessment upon the\r\nstockholders, and in part by the sale of new securities.”[513]\r\n\r\nA not dissimilar suggestion was made by the Government Directors in\r\n1894. They proposed to ascertain the minimum net earning power of\r\nthe railroad or railroads to be reorganized, and to issue a blanket\r\nmortgage of 3 per cent 100-year bonds to an amount such that the\r\naccruing interest would not exceed the net earning power. By sale of a\r\nportion of these bonds, together with a $10 assessment on the stock,\r\nand the use of the moneys and securities in the sinking fund, they\r\nwould have paid off the prior liens, and then, after exchanging the\r\nnew 3 per cent bonds for the government claim, they would have used the\r\nbalance to retire the junior securities, adding preferred stock, so\r\nmuch as necessary, to compensate for the difference in yield between\r\nthe old securities and the new ones received. The amount of securities\r\nrequired they estimated at $150,000,000 3 per cent bonds, $20,000,000\r\npreferred stock, and $61,000,000 common stock; the latter exchanging\r\nfor old common stock at par.\r\n\r\nBoth of these plans contained excellent features, chief among which\r\nwere their provisions for the raising of cash and their use of\r\npreferred stock. The cash which Mr. Boissevain proposed to raise was\r\nto meet the floating debt, for he hoped to refund the government\r\nindebtedness; and while he may scarcely seem to deserve commendation\r\nfor not attempting to fund the quick liabilities as well, this is not\r\nthe case, as the history of the Union Pacific itself can demonstrate.\r\nThe Government Directors intended to use the cash procured not only for\r\nsettling the floating debt, but also for partially retiring the prior\r\nliens, so under their scheme an assessment was quite inevitable; and\r\nhaving made that as large as they dared they are not to be criticised\r\nfor resorting to the sale of securities for the additional funds\r\nrequired, especially since these securities were to have a first lien\r\non the road. As regards the preferred stock it is not clear from his\r\nstatement at the time whether Mr. Boissevain had in mind the exchange\r\nof junior securities for bonds and stock or some for bonds and some\r\nfor stock alone, but subsequent developments show that his intention\r\nwas the former. Thus his idea was the same as that of the Government\r\nDirectors, viz., to give the junior bondholders a right to a low rate\r\nof interest well within the earning capacity of the road, and to join\r\nwith this the right to a higher return whenever the road should earn\r\nit. Mr. Boissevain’s estimate of the maximum fixed charges which\r\nthe road could safely stand was, however, high, and the plan of the\r\nGovernment Directors, if conservatively carried out, would have been\r\nbetter. Finally, the Government Directors contemplated foreclosure,\r\nwhile Mr. Boissevain did not; the relative merits of the plans on this\r\npoint depending largely on the terms which the bondholders could be\r\ninduced voluntarily to accept.\r\n\r\nDuring 1894 and 1895 discussion was active, both in Congress and out,\r\nwhile the reorganization committee worked over the scheme which Mr.\r\nBoissevain had put forward, without making any formal announcement of\r\na plan. Everything depended on the terms upon which the United States\r\nshould insist. The reorganization committee hoped for a refunding of\r\nthe government debt at 2 per cent. It had suggested that it would raise\r\nthe funds to pay off the prior liens if Congress would take a 2 per\r\ncent 50-year bond in satisfaction of the government claim, would extend\r\nthe provisions contained in the Reilly Bill to a committee charged\r\nwith the duty of purchasing the property of the Union Pacific, and\r\nwould grant the committee the power to form a successor corporation\r\nfor the general purpose stated in the Acts of 1862 and of 1864, and\r\nwith the general powers given in those Acts, together with the same\r\nrights, privileges, and freedom of action that were exercised and\r\nenjoyed by other railroads.[514] Subsequently it had offered to pay the\r\nprincipal of the government indebtedness in cash, providing that the\r\nGovernment would relinquish all claims to interest.[515] If either of\r\nthese propositions was accepted it was willing to go ahead; while if\r\nboth were refused, and no official counter-proposition was made by the\r\nUnited States, it seemed idle for the general reorganization committee\r\nor any other committee to promulgate a plan.\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile the Union Pacific system was disintegrating; partly\r\nfrom the efforts of the receivers to rid themselves of branches and\r\ncontracts which had become burdensome, and partly through the action\r\nof bondholders of subsidiary roads who refused to wait for the slow\r\naction of Congress, and insisted on foreclosure of their liens. As\r\nearly as August, 1893, ex-Governor Evans, a prominent stockholder of\r\nthe Union Pacific, Denver & Gulf, had petitioned for an accounting\r\nfrom the Union Pacific, alleging that the branch was being bled for\r\nthe advantage of the main line. When receivers for the Union Pacific\r\nsystem were appointed Mr. Evans petitioned for a separate receiver, and\r\nwas granted his request. Litigation followed, and an attempt was made\r\nto get Mr. E. E. Anderson appointed as co-receiver; but the machinery\r\nof foreclosure and sale were duly put in motion and the line became\r\nseparated from the parent company. In October, 1893, in view of an\r\nimpending default, the Fort Worth & Denver City Railway Company was\r\nplaced in the hands of receivers, as was the same month the Denver,\r\nLeadville & Gunnison and the St. Joseph & Grand Island. In April, 1894,\r\na receiver was appointed for the Leavenworth, Topeka & Southwestern;\r\nin June one for the Oregon Railway & Navigation Company. Foreclosure\r\nproceedings against these and other branches were instituted, and\r\nwere attended by a very considerable measure of success.[516] On the\r\nother hand, the receivers were anxious to get rid of onerous contracts\r\nand unprofitable branches. On the 16th of March, 1894, they formally\r\nabandoned the Leavenworth, Topeka & Southwestern. In July, 1894, they\r\npetitioned to be relieved from certain guarantees and contracts, and\r\nasked instructions concerning the operation of certain lines. Judge\r\nSanborn, in the United States Court at St. Paul, set November 15 for a\r\nhearing, and appointed a special master to take testimony. The master\r\nreported in October. He recommended the continuance of operation of\r\nmost of the lines in question, but found that the receivers were\r\nnot bound by the disputed contracts; and in November Judge Sanborn\r\nconfirmed the bulk of his report. The net result was a reduction in the\r\nmileage of the Union Pacific from 8167 in the latter part of 1893 to\r\n4469 in May, 1895; at which time proceedings against the Oregon Short\r\nLine Railroad Company threatened to withdraw 1424 miles besides.\r\n\r\nWith matters in this state the reorganization committee was genuinely\r\ndiscouraged by the refusal of Congress to pass the Reilly Bill,\r\nproviding for a refunding of the government debt; although this had\r\nbeen reported to the House with the alternative amendment proposed\r\nby the committee accepting the payment in cash of the principal\r\nof the government debt in full satisfaction of claims against the\r\ncompany.[517] Since Congress had earlier refused a proposition to pay\r\noff the prior liens in full on condition that the government debt be\r\nrefunded at 2 per cent,[518] it was felt that nothing but cash payment\r\nof principal and interest would be acceptable, and this the committee\r\nrefused to undertake. On March 8 the announcement was made that the\r\nreorganization committee of the Union Pacific road had abandoned its\r\ntask and would return the securities deposited with it, and a few days\r\nlater the actual disbandment took place.[519]\r\n\r\nBetween March, 1895, and the following October little progress was\r\nmade. With the dissolution of the general reorganization committee\r\ndisappeared the one body capable of formulating a comprehensive scheme\r\nand of securing its widespread acceptance. The committees which\r\nremained represented each some one or two mortgages, and were thus\r\nconfined too narrowly in their sympathies to command much confidence\r\nfrom bondholders as a whole. Late in 1895, however, new interests\r\nundertook the reorganization of the property, and another general\r\ncommittee was formed, comprising General Louis Fitzgerald; Marvin\r\nHughitt, president of the Chicago & Northwestern; Chauncey M. Depew,\r\npresident of the New York Central; Jacob H. Schiff of Kuhn, Loeb & Co.;\r\nOliver Ames, director of the Union Pacific; and T. Jefferson Coolidge,\r\nJr., president of the Old Colony Trust Company.[520] This committee’s\r\nplan of action was noteworthy in three particulars. First, it\r\ncontemplated a foreclosure sale. This, it is true, was but resignation\r\nto the inevitable, for foreclosure suits were already under way, and\r\nan attempt to check them would have had scarcely a possibility of\r\nsuccess. Second, it made no definite provision for the government debt.\r\nA certain amount of bonds and stock were reserved from the securities\r\nproposed to be issued for the purpose of settling the government claim,\r\nbut the exact method in which that indebtedness should be treated was\r\nleft for future arrangement. Third, it did not attempt to meet the\r\ncollateral trust notes of 1891, which constituted so large a portion\r\nof the floating debt. “The securities embraced in these trusts,” it\r\ndeclared, “are largely those of companies which have already, by orders\r\nof court made in the original general receivership, or in independent\r\nforeclosure proceedings, lost in part or in whole their character as\r\nparts of what has been known as the Union Pacific system. Independent\r\nreorganization of many of these properties are pending. The purposes\r\nwhich brought into existence guarantees of the obligations of many of\r\nthese auxiliary companies have been accomplished by construction or\r\notherwise, and considerations will not exist, upon reorganization, for\r\ncontinued relations with (them) upon the basis of any assumption of\r\ntheir fixed charges.”[521] Thus, at the very outset, this new committee\r\nremoved the three matters which had given its predecessors the most\r\ntrouble. The proposed foreclosure made it both easier to get assents\r\nto a plan and more difficult to block its operation; the postponement\r\nof the question of the government debt allowed the committee to go\r\nahead without waiting for Congress; and the refusal to provide for\r\nthe collateral notes relieved it of many difficulties, and threw the\r\nholders of these notes back upon the collateral which they had exacted\r\nas security.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the Fitzgerald Committee followed, for the rest, the\r\ngeneral lines earlier laid down by the Brice Committee. To retire all\r\nexisting mortgage indebtedness it proposed to issue:\r\n\r\n  First mortgage railway land grant 50-year 4 per cent\r\n    gold bonds                                            $100,000,000\r\n  4 per cent preferred stock                                75,000,000\r\n  Common stock                                              61,000,000\r\n\r\nThe reasoning by which these sums were arrived at was as follows:\r\n\r\n  The lowest net earnings the Union Pacific Railway had\r\n    ever recorded had been those of 1894                    $4,315,077\r\n  The committee planned to issue $100,000,000 4 per cent\r\n    50-year bonds, on which the interest would be            4,000,000\r\n\r\nThis would be all the company would have to pay in any one year.\r\n\r\n  The average net earnings for the 10 years before 1894\r\n    had been                                                $7,563,669\r\n  To the $100,000,000 bonds the committee proposed to add\r\n    $75,000,000 preferred stock. The annual dividend on\r\n    this would be                                            3,000,000\r\n\r\nPayment on bonds and preferred stock together thus equalled the average\r\nearnings.\r\n\r\n  Net earnings between 1885 and 1894 had gone in some years\r\n    as high as                                              $9,000,000\r\n\r\nTo the above bonds and stock the committee wished to add $61,000,000\r\ncommon stock, on which dividends might be paid if it seemed advisable.\r\n\r\nNew common stock exchanged at par for old; new bonds and preferred\r\nstock exchanged for old bonds, with a residue which was to be set off\r\nagainst the government debt and to be used for cash requirements.\r\nThe cardinal principle of the reorganization was that no new 4 per\r\ncent bonds should be issued in exchange where the old mortgage did\r\nnot contribute the full value; or, to put it more accurately, that\r\nno securityholders were to be given the right to claim a sum greater\r\nthan their property could earn as judged from past experience. At the\r\nsame time enough preferred stock was distributed to give bondholders\r\nthe same returns as before when the road should earn it. A $15\r\nassessment was levied upon stockholders. This was several times the\r\nquoted price of the stock early in 1896, but was not more than the\r\nstock would probably soon sell for after reorganization. A syndicate\r\nagreed to advance $10,000,000 to $15,000,000, for payment of coupons\r\nas they fell due and for expenses, in return for which they received\r\n$5,000,000 in preferred stock quoted at 59, or 19 per cent on a\r\ncapital of $15,000,000 at current prices. In addition the bankers who\r\nmanaged the syndicate received $1,000,000 in preferred stock; making a\r\ntotal expenditure of $6,000,000, a not exorbitant commission. Besides\r\nthe bonds and stock for strictly reorganization purposes, there was\r\nreserved to dispose of equipment obligations, and for reorganization\r\nand corporate uses, $13,000,000 in 4 per cent bonds and $7,000,000\r\nin preferred stock. Reorganization uses, as defined by Mr. Pierce,\r\nwere those which might arise unprovided for and of an extraordinary\r\ncharacter, all of which could not be foreseen. Corporate uses were\r\nthose which would be proper to the corporation thereafter, such, for\r\ninstance, as the issue of securities in extension of the property.[522]\r\n\r\nAfter all the securities of the old corporation had been accounted for\r\nthere remained $35,755,280 of the first mortgage bonds and $20,864,000\r\nof preferred stock as a fund or resource for the settlement of the\r\ngovernment debt; or, in round numbers, an amount of 4 per cent bonds\r\nequal to the principal of that debt and an amount of preferred stock\r\nequal to the accrued interest. Just how this was to be used the\r\ncommittee did not pretend absolutely to say. “We desire to meet\r\nany proposition of the Government,” said Mr. Pierce, “or to suggest\r\nany proposition which, after investigation, we believe will meet\r\nthe approval of the Government within the limits of the financial\r\npossibilities of the property based upon this plan. In other words,\r\nwe have made no sort of a hard and fast rule.” In case the Government\r\nshould prove obstinate and should refuse settlement on reasonable\r\nterms, it was the idea of the committee that it would be entitled on\r\nforeclosure to its share as a second mortgage bondholder only, and that\r\nthe property would pass under the sale free from all liens, including\r\nthat of the United States. “Our view upon that point,” said Mr. Pierce,\r\n“is that when the Government subordinated its lien to that of the first\r\nmortgage bondholders, it did so deliberately and in terms effective for\r\nthat purpose. The Government then consented to all remedies that were\r\nnecessary for the protection of this prior lien; and an indispensable\r\nelement of such priority would be the right of foreclosure. And unless\r\nthere was a concealed purpose on the part of the Government, that right\r\nof effective foreclosure was undoubtedly impliedly granted.”[523]\r\n\r\nSubsequent negotiations with the bondholders brought a reduction in\r\nthe proposed issue of mortgage bonds from $100,000,000 to $75,000,000,\r\naffecting the Kansas Pacific consols and the Union Pacific Sinking Fund\r\n8s. Thus the former were allotted 50 per cent in first mortgage 4s and\r\n110 per cent in preferred stock, instead of 80 per cent in 4s and 50\r\nper cent in preferred as before; and the latter 75 per cent in 4s and\r\n100 per cent in preferred stock, instead of 100 per cent and 50 per\r\ncent respectively. This reduced the proposed charges $1,000,000, and\r\nproportionately strengthened the scheme.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the plan was a strong one. It reduced fixed charges from\r\nover $7,000,000 to under $4,000,000, with an eventual lower limit of\r\n$3,000,000, and this amount such good authorities as Messrs. Mink and\r\nClark pronounced the road safely able to earn in spite of the reduction\r\nin its mileage.[524] During the receivership, moreover, the system had\r\nbecome purged by the cancellation of onerous contracts and the lopping\r\noff of unprofitable branches, and though some lines were lost which\r\nit was desirable to retain, the Union Pacific was not precluded from\r\nthe repurchase of these, and did in fact regain the most important.\r\nThe bondholders were put in no worse position than before, for they\r\ncould never permanently get more than the earnings of the road, and\r\nthis the new distribution of securities generally assured them. The\r\nposition of the common stockholders was improved, for whereas between\r\n1883 and 1893 fixed charges had only once fallen below $7,300,000, now\r\nless than $7,000,000 were to be taken before their claims were heard,\r\nwhile both the gross and the net earnings of the road promptly regained\r\ntheir old level. Finally, the general principle was sound, as has been\r\nemphasized several times before. It gave to each class of securities\r\na claim to interest strictly proportional to the earning capacity of\r\nthe road, and added to this a preferred stock on which no payment was\r\nto be made unless earned; while it provided for a liberal assessment\r\nupon stockholders, and attempted no funding of the current liabilities\r\nincurred during the past troubled years.\r\n\r\nThe time limit for deposits under the plan was originally set at\r\nDecember 31, 1895. It was then extended to January 15, 1896, and later\r\nto January 29 of that year. By January 8 the reorganization committee\r\nwas able to announce that it had secured majorities of all of the\r\nfirst mortgage bonds outstanding except an inconsiderable shortage\r\nin one class. This was followed, in spite of some opposition among\r\nLondon brokers, by the deposit of a majority of the shares of the\r\ncompany, and by the assent of other securities. In January, 1896, in a\r\nletter to the chairman of the House Committee on Pacific Railways, Mr.\r\nFitzgerald stated that his committee embraced a substantially single\r\nrepresentation of all Union Pacific mortgage bonds in circulation\r\nexcept those held by the United States.[525]\r\n\r\nForeclosure proceedings had been long under way. In January, 1897, the\r\nGovernment agreed to join in them in consideration of a guarantee of\r\na bid at least equal to the original amount of government bonds, less\r\npayments made by the company to the Government, with interest at 3⅓\r\nper cent per annum.[526] The guarantee was to be of cash, so that the\r\nGovernment’s relations with the property would terminate completely\r\nupon confirmation of the sale. This was the first affirmative action\r\nwhich the Government had taken, and the reorganization committee\r\naccepted it, despairing of better terms. The guaranteed payment was\r\nin part offset by sinking-fund assets of $17,062,664, leaving a net\r\namount to be provided of $28,691,336.[527] By August, 1897, foreclosure\r\nof the main line had been ordered by the courts in all the states\r\nthrough which the Union Pacific passed, both under the first and the\r\ngovernment mortgages. Previous to this the plan of reorganization had\r\nbeen declared operative, and articles of incorporation for the new\r\ncompany had been filed; while the first instalment of the assessment\r\non the stock was called by the middle of the month. An unexpected\r\ndevelopment now occurred. Although willing to join in foreclosure\r\nproceedings, the Government found the decrees of foreclosure to some\r\nextent unsatisfactory, and prepared the papers for an appeal. Objection\r\nwas particularly made to the fact that the Omaha Bridge mortgage,\r\namounting to about $1,200,000, was adjudged superior to the lien of the\r\nGovernment on that part of the road between Omaha and Council Bluffs,\r\nand that the money and assets in the hands of the receivers accruing\r\nfrom the operation of the roads were ordered to be sold instead of\r\nbeing reserved to meet a deficiency judgment expected to be obtained.\r\nLearning this, the reorganization committee increased its guarantee by\r\nover $4,000,000, making the total guaranteed bid $50,000,000 instead\r\nof $45,754,060. “This increase,” said the Attorney-General, “removed\r\nthe objections to the decrees so far as the money contents were\r\nconcerned. In all else the decrees were just and satisfactory.”[528]\r\nEven so, perhaps partly for political reasons, the Government was\r\nnot ready to allow a sale, and later in the year gave notice that\r\nit would apply for a postponement to December 15, in order to give\r\nCongress an opportunity to consider the matter. The prospect of renewed\r\ncongressional agitation stimulated the reorganization committee\r\nto prompt action. “The Committee,” it declared, “has reached the\r\nconclusion that the interests of the securityholders represented by it\r\nand of the syndicate furnishing the funds to finance the reorganization\r\ndemand reorganization without any further delay. In this situation\r\nthe committee contemplates ... to oppose any adjournment of the sale\r\nof the main line and to bid it in, if need be, for the full amount\r\nof the Government’s claim, the additional sum involved in this being\r\n$8,000,000.”[529] Postponement of the sale of the Kansas Pacific was to\r\nbe allowed, the committee meanwhile making up its mind on what terms to\r\nbid it in. This proposition was telegraphed to Washington and quickly\r\naccepted. It constituted a complete surrender on the part of the\r\ncommittee, so far as the Union Pacific proper was concerned. Instead\r\nof being refunded, the government debt was paid off in cash; instead\r\nof compromising for the principal alone, both principal and interest\r\nwere paid in full. The result reflects credit on the sharpness of the\r\nAttorney-General, but the method was scarcely worthy of the Government\r\nwhich he represented.\r\n\r\nNovember 1st and 2d, 1897, the property was sold under foreclosure of\r\nthe government and first mortgage liens, and the prices were:\r\n\r\n  For the Union Pacific main line,                      $40,253,605\r\n  For bonds in the government sinking fund,              13,645,250\r\n                                                        -----------\r\n                                                        $53,898,855\r\n  In addition the Government received in cash in the\r\n    sinking fund as of November 1st,                      4,549,368\r\n                                                        -----------\r\n                                                        $58,448,224\r\n  In addition to this sum the committee was obliged,\r\n    under its agreement with the Government, to buy\r\n    up the first mortgage, amounting to                 $27,637,436\r\n  The total of the first and second mortgages was        67,891,041\r\n  Adding                                                 13,645,250\r\n  Of securities purchased for cash, the total payment\r\n    aggregated over                                      81,500,000[530]\r\n\r\nOn February 12, 1898, the reorganization committee bought in the Kansas\r\nPacific, guaranteeing for the Government a bid at the sale which should\r\nequal the principal of the government debt, _i. e._ $6,303,000.[531]\r\nOther minor roads were also bought back on foreclosure sales, and from\r\ntime to time as the mortgage committee sold the collateral back of the\r\ntrust notes of 1891 the Union Pacific Railroad Company bought portions\r\nof the same. In 1899 the Union Pacific stock was increased $27,460,000,\r\nand the new issue was exchanged share for share with Oregon Short\r\nLine stock, thus regaining control of that important property. Later\r\nthe same year a further increase was effected to retire $14,000,000\r\nOregon Short Line bonds and $11,000,000 Oregon Railway & Navigation\r\nCompany preferred stock. The net result was to avoid any considerable\r\ndismemberment of the system. Whereas 7673.59 miles had been reported\r\nfor 1892, 5399.01 were reported for 1899. The main line from Portland,\r\nOregon, to Omaha and Kansas City, via Ogden, Cheyenne, and Denver, was\r\nkept intact, the principal losses being of branch lines in Nebraska and\r\nKansas.[532]\r\n\r\nA detailed account of the later financial operations of the Union\r\nPacific divides the company’s recent development into three parts:[533]\r\nFirst, the regaining of control of the principal auxiliary systems and\r\nbranch lines which the receivership had temporarily separated from\r\nthe parent stem; second, the purchase of large amounts of stock in\r\nthe Southern Pacific and the attempt to share in the control of the\r\nBurlington, which latter involved the purchase of Northern Pacific\r\nstock and the formation of the Northern Securities Company; and third,\r\nthe sale of the stock acquired in the fight over the Burlington, and\r\nthe subsequent purchase of Alton, Atchison, Baltimore & Ohio, Illinois\r\nCentral, and other stocks. The repurchase of auxiliary lines has just\r\nbeen alluded to; and into the history of the Burlington struggle there\r\nis no need to go at length.\r\n\r\nOn June 30, 1900, the Union Pacific, Oregon Short Line, and Oregon\r\nRailroad & Navigation Companies operated 5427.89 miles of line. The\r\nsystem stretched from Kansas City and Council Bluffs to Ogden, and\r\nreached the Pacific coast in the Northwest at Portland. It had no\r\nrails of its own in California, but was dependent on the Southern\r\nPacific tracks for connections both at Ogden and at Portland. The\r\nSouthern Pacific extended from New Orleans through Texas, New Mexico,\r\nand Arizona to California, and thence up the coast to Sacramento. At\r\nSacramento it divided; one line continued north to Portland, and one\r\nturned northeast through Nevada to Ogden, Utah. Now, in 1901 it so\r\nhappened that the Southern Pacific was for sale. Crocker, Stanford, and\r\nHuntington, who had controlled it, were dead, and their successors were\r\nnot eager to retain the railroad as an independent line. Mr. Harriman\r\nseized the opportunity. In 1901 he bought for the Union Pacific 750,000\r\nshares out of a little less than 2,000,000, and the following year\r\nhe increased his holdings to 900,000. The Union Pacific financed the\r\npurchase by the issue of collateral bonds. The acquisition was of vast\r\nimportance. Not only did it afford a direct connection between Ogden\r\nand the coast, but it eliminated one of the Union Pacific’s four great\r\ncompetitors in transcontinental business, and made Mr. Harriman the\r\ndominant figure in the Southwest.\r\n\r\nNorth of the Ogden-San Francisco line the conditions were less\r\nsatisfactory. The Great Northern and the Northern Pacific were\r\nhere supreme, and in 1901 were negotiating for the purchase of the\r\nBurlington to give them an entrance into Chicago. Mr. Harriman asked\r\nfor a share in this purchase but was refused. He thereupon began to buy\r\nNorthern Pacific stock in the endeavor to secure by this a half control\r\nin the more eastern road. It was the struggle which then ensued between\r\nMr. Harriman and Mr. Hill which caused the stock exchange panic of May,\r\n1901, and which resulted in the formation of the Northern Securities\r\nCompany, in which Mr. Harriman was allotted a large though not a\r\ncontrolling interest. On the breakup of the Northern Securities Company\r\nthe Union Pacific received back some $25,000,000 in Great Northern and\r\n$32,000,000 in Northern Pacific shares,[534] worth at market prices\r\nabout $100,000,000.[535]\r\n\r\nThis Northern Securities episode had little effect on traffic\r\nconditions in the Northwest, but it did profoundly influence the\r\nfinancial policy of the Union Pacific during the following years.[536]\r\nThe dissolution of the Northern Securities Company gave to the Union\r\nPacific Great Northern and Northern Pacific shares, which were valuable\r\nas investments only. And as investments these stocks soon became\r\nundesirable. We have said that the combined value of the securities\r\ntransferred approximated $100,000,000 at the time of transfer. From\r\nthat time on the stocks appreciated in value till they were worth\r\nfrom $145,000,000 to $150,000,000, and yielded an income of less\r\nthan 3 per cent on their market price. It was good policy to sell\r\nthem, and $118,000,000 worth were accordingly disposed of, leaving\r\nsome $30,000,000 worth still in the hands of the company.[537] What\r\nshould be done with the enormous resources thus secured? Some of the\r\ncash was used to buy Chicago & Alton stock,—some of it was put out\r\nin demand loans. But beginning with June 30, 1906, the Union Pacific\r\nand Oregon Short Line began investment in stocks of other companies\r\non a great scale. $41,442,028 were put into Illinois Central stock;\r\n$10,395,000 into Atchison preferred; $45,466,960 into Baltimore & Ohio,\r\ncommon and preferred; $19,634,280 into New York Central; and lesser\r\namounts into Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, Chicago & Northwestern,\r\nSt. Joseph & Grand Island, and other companies. In all, $131,693,271\r\nwere invested during a little over seven months.[538] This has been\r\nthe characteristic feature of recent Union Pacific finance. The large\r\npurchases of stock in other roads have assured it favorable connections\r\nin the Illinois Central and in the Baltimore & Ohio, and have modified\r\nthe severity of competition with the Atchison.[539] Including the\r\nSouthern Pacific, its system reaches from Chicago to Portland, San\r\nFrancisco, Los Angeles, and the Gulf, and has an influential voice\r\nin two of the principal roads connecting Chicago with the Atlantic\r\nseaboard. At the same time, the extensive investment of Union Pacific\r\nfunds to secure gains unconnected with increase of traffic over its\r\nlines has provoked merited criticism. A railroad is, after all, a\r\nmachine for transporting passengers and goods, not an engine of\r\nspeculation; and both from the point of view of the community which it\r\nserves and of the investors who hold its securities it is advisable\r\nthat its income should depend on the business which its managers\r\nconduct and are responsible for, and not on circumstances over which\r\nthey have no control. So far as Union Pacific purchases have been\r\ndesigned to open connections or to modify competition they have had a\r\nsound foundation. So far as they have been financial operations only\r\nthey are not to be commended.[540]\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of operation the success of the Union Pacific\r\nhas been remarkable. Like most roads it came out of its receivership in\r\nbetter shape than it went in, but with much lacking for the efficient\r\nand economical handling of its traffic. Since 1900 over $52,000,000\r\nhave been invested in betterments and in new equipment, of which some\r\n$15,000,000 have been withdrawn directly from income. Maintenance\r\ncharges have also been liberal, particularly in the last few years.\r\nGrades and curves have been eliminated, steel bridges have been put\r\nin place of wooden, new and heavier rails have been laid, ballast\r\nsupplied, and equipment greatly enlarged and improved. Whereas in 1896\r\n13 per cent of all the Union Pacific system was laid with iron rails,\r\nand only 24 per cent had rails weighing more than sixty pounds to the\r\nyard, in 1907 there was no iron reported, and only 33 per cent of the\r\ntrack did _not_ have rails weighing more than sixty pounds to the yard.\r\nThe average capacity of freight cars was a shade over twenty tons in\r\nFebruary, 1898; it was over thirty-four tons on June 30, 1907, and the\r\nnew freight cars added during the last-named year averaged a capacity\r\nof sixty-seven tons apiece.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these improvements the Union Pacific has been\r\nable to handle a very greatly increased business. Between 1899 and\r\n1907 the tons of revenue freight carried one mile increased from\r\n1,393,207,990 to 5,704,061,535, and the passengers carried one mile\r\nfrom 167,117,388 to 680,278,509. This fourfold increase has been\r\npacked away in the larger cars, which in turn have been combined into\r\nlonger trains. Twenty-one tons are now put into the average freight\r\ncar, and thirty-two freight cars form an average train. In 1899\r\nthe average car held twelve tons and twenty-nine of them carried a\r\ntrain-load. Sixty-six is the average number of passengers per train\r\nto-day; thirty-three was the average number in 1899. And so the\r\nincreased business has not occasioned a proportionate growth in cost.\r\nIt takes but little more than three times the outlay in conducting\r\ntransportation to do over four times the work, and other railroad\r\nexpenses have varied even less.\r\n\r\nThis increased business and less rapidly increasing cost has meant,\r\nfinally, an increase in profits, and explains how it has been possible\r\nin seven years to take $15,000,000 from income for improvements besides\r\nliberally maintaining the property. The Union Pacific is prosperous as\r\nit never has been before. In 1907 its total fixed charges, in round\r\nnumbers, were $8,600,000, and its net income was $45,000,000. Of this\r\nincome $23,500,000 were paid out in dividends, $1,960,000 appropriated\r\nfor betterments, additions, and new equipment, and $10,700,000 carried\r\nto surplus. There were $69,000,000 in bills payable, incurred since\r\n1906, in part for improvements and the like, but largely in the\r\ncourse of the company’s financial experiments; but $75,000,000 in\r\nconvertible bonds have been authorized to cover them. Stock and bond\r\nissues are much larger than in 1899 and will be larger still when the\r\nnew convertibles are all sold. Fixed charges, however, are less than\r\n$5,000,000 greater than they were eight years ago. In order to imperil\r\nbond interest net earnings will have to decline by 81 per cent; and\r\neven were this to happen it is probable that some margin could be\r\nretained by a decrease in the generous sums now being spent for the\r\nmaintenance of equipment and of road.[541]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nNORTHERN PACIFIC\r\n\r\n  Act of 1864—Failure and reorganization—Extension into the\r\n    Northwest—Villard and the Oregon & Transcontinental Company—Lack\r\n    of prosperity—Refunding mortgage—Lease of Wisconsin Central\r\n    —Financial difficulties—Receivership—Legal complications—\r\n    Reorganization—Subsequent history.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Northern Pacific Railroad Company was chartered in 1864, and failed\r\nin 1875 and in 1893. Besides these bankruptcies it has been in frequent\r\nfinancial difficulty, and on the whole furnishes an instructive chapter\r\nin a study of reorganizations.\r\n\r\nThe Act of July 2, 1864,[542] empowered the Northern Pacific\r\ncorporation to build a line from some point on Lake Superior, in the\r\nstate of Minnesota or Wisconsin, westerly on a line north of the\r\n45th degree of latitude, to a point near or at Portland, Oregon. It\r\nprovided for organization on subscription for 20,000 shares out of an\r\nauthorized capital of 1,000,000 shares with 10 per cent paid in, and\r\ngranted forty alternate sections of public land per mile throughout\r\nthe territories, and twenty alternate sections throughout the states\r\nacross which the road should pass. This liberal donation was influenced\r\nin part by the fact that the value of lands in the Northwest was then\r\nlow, and in part by the refusal of any money subsidy. The Government\r\nwas to issue patents on the completion of stretches of twenty-five\r\nmiles built in “good, substantial, and workmanlike manner,” and was to\r\nsurvey lands for forty miles on each side of the line[543] as fast as\r\nthe construction of the road should require. The company was to begin\r\nwork within two years and was to finish the line within twelve years,\r\nand it was provided that in case of non-fulfilment of these conditions\r\nCongress could do “any and all acts and things which (might) be needful\r\nand necessary to insure a speedy completion of the road.” A section\r\nwhich gave trouble till amended forbade the issue of mortgage or\r\nconstruction bonds, or the making of a mortgage or lien upon the road\r\nin any way except by the consent of the Congress of the United States.\r\nThe company was to obtain the consent of the legislature of any state\r\nbefore commencing construction through it, and finally the Act was to\r\nbe void unless bona fide subscriptions of $2,000,000 to the stock, with\r\n10 per cent paid in, should be obtained within two years.\r\n\r\nA project so daring as the construction of a railroad through the\r\nunsettled Northwest not unnaturally found it difficult to obtain\r\nfinancial support. The capitalists who at first undertook the work were\r\nunable to carry it through.[544] In 1869 and 1870 two developments\r\noccurred: the prohibition of bond issues contained in the act of\r\nincorporation was removed, and Jay Cooke became interested in the\r\nbuilding of the road. Both facts were of far-reaching importance. Mr.\r\nCooke was one of the foremost financiers of his time. He was a man of\r\ngreat personal energy, large fortune, and extensive personal following,\r\nand was admirably adapted to the promotion of the work in hand. The\r\nremoval of the prohibition upon bond issues made it possible, with\r\nhis support, to secure some funds from a mortgage issue and to allow\r\nconstruction to begin.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 Jay Cooke & Company were appointed financial agents of\r\nthe Northern Pacific Railroad Company. On July 1, 1870, issues of\r\n$100,000,000 in 7.3 per cent first mortgage bonds and $100,000,000\r\nin stock were authorized. The bonds were to be sold to the agents\r\nat 88; the bulk of the stock was to go to the agents as bonus or to\r\nthe syndicate interested with them. The same parties agreed to raise\r\n$5,000,000 in cash within thirty days, in order to commence the\r\nbuilding of the line. This made a fair start possible, and by May,\r\n1873, over five hundred miles had been completed. The situation was\r\nnevertheless a difficult one because of the reluctance of capitalists\r\nto invest in the new first mortgage bonds. In 1870 extensive plans\r\nwere made to interest the European markets, but all in vain because\r\nof the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war. In America a similar\r\ncampaign was not much more successful.[545] The high price asked\r\nfor the bonds,[546] the uncertain nature of the enterprise, the not\r\naltogether ill-founded rumors of extravagance and mismanagement of\r\nthe construction actually under way, the presidential election of\r\n1872, all hindered rapid sales. Failure to sell bonds meant financial\r\nstringency for the Northern Pacific. Operating expenses were high, and\r\nthe interest on outstanding indebtedness was considerable. On the other\r\nhand, earnings were very small. No through business could be secured\r\ntill the completion of the road at least to the Snake River, and local\r\ntraffic was yet to be developed. As a result, the company borrowed more\r\nand more from Jay Cooke & Co., and that firm soon found itself heavily\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nOn September 18, 1873, Jay Cooke & Co. closed its doors. The shock to\r\nthe railroad was great. The quotations of first mortgage bonds dropped\r\nfrom par to about 11. For a time the company struggled on. In December,\r\n1873, a funding of interest was carried through, whereby all coupons\r\nup to and including that of January 1, 1875, were made exchangeable\r\nfor five-year 7 per cent coupon bonds, convertible into the company’s\r\nfirst mortgage bonds at par, and into the company’s lands at 25 per\r\ncent off from the regular prices.[547] In April, 1874, settlement was\r\nmade with Jay Cooke & Co. by the transfer of the railroad’s first\r\nmortgage bonds and other securities.[548] These measures offered only\r\ntemporary relief. Business was at a standstill throughout the country.\r\nGross earnings for the year ending June 30, 1874, were reported to\r\nbe $988,131, while $30,780,904 7.3 per cent bonds had been issued,\r\nand the floating debt stood at $777,335. The Northern Pacific was not\r\nonly unable to meet its fixed charges, but was in default by a margin\r\nwhich it was hopeless to attempt to overcome. The original project had\r\ncompletely failed; and the only means of continuing the enterprise\r\nseemed to lie in a government guarantee of the railroad’s bonds, or in\r\na reorganization so drastic as to sweep away fixed charges and to give\r\nthe company a fresh start.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1874, the first plan was tried. A bill was introduced into\r\nCongress providing that the company should be authorized to issue\r\nits 5 per cent thirty-year bonds for $50,000 per mile on its entire\r\nline, complete and incomplete, and that on completed sections of\r\nthe road twenty miles long it should deliver its 7.3 per cent bonds\r\nat a rate of $50,000 per mile, receiving in return $40,000 of the\r\n5 per cent bonds with interest but not principal guaranteed by the\r\nGovernment, which should hold the difference of $10,000 as a reserve\r\nfund. Holders of outstanding 7.3 per cent bonds were to have the right\r\nof exchanging their bonds for new 5s on the same terms.[549] In return\r\nfor the guarantee the railroad was to surrender to the United States\r\nGovernment its entire land grant, to be sold under the direction of the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, and to turn over semi-annually its entire\r\nnet earnings. The Government was to have the right in addition to sell\r\nthe Northern Pacific 5 per cent bonds whenever the combined yield of\r\nthe land grant and the net earnings should not equal the interest\r\nguaranteed. Finally, Congress was to have power to fix fares, etc.,\r\nprovided that the government control did not impair the security of\r\nthe bonds. In brief, the capitalists who had involved themselves in\r\nNorthern Pacific affairs were ready to surrender their whole enterprise\r\nto the Government if the Government would carry it through. But\r\nCongress was so little willing to take the responsibility that the bill\r\nnever came to a vote.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1875, while the application for government aid was still\r\npending, the directors called a general meeting of the bondholders.\r\nWhen it assembled President Cass made a statement of the financial\r\ncondition of the company. The outstanding debt, said he, was\r\n$30,441,300. Of the 7.3 per cent bonds issued as collateral for\r\nfloating debt, mostly in 1875, there had been pledged $1,780,300 at the\r\nrate of from twenty-five to forty cents on the dollar. The interest on\r\nland warrants, bonds, and scrip given in funding of coupons amounted\r\nto $732,632. The floating debt was $634,758, of which $150,000 were\r\narranged for settlement within a few days; and $250,000 were due to\r\ndirectors for money advanced to finish the Pacific section after the\r\nfailure of Jay Cooke & Co. in 1873. The total net earnings to date had\r\nbeen $124,056, and the capital stock was $25,497,600. By this report\r\nit seems that some slight advance had been made since June, 1874, but\r\nin no measure which afforded any hope for the continued solvency of\r\nthe company. Most instructive were the figures for the floating debt,\r\nwhich in less than five years had increased to a sum more than five\r\ntimes the net earnings for the whole period. After some discussion the\r\nbondholders elected a committee of seven to report at a future meeting.\r\nThe committee recommended a receivership, the directors did not oppose,\r\nand on April 16 General Cass was appointed receiver, resigning his\r\nposition as president to accept.\r\n\r\nBy this time hope of government aid had vanished, and no time was lost\r\nin accepting the alternative of a drastic reorganization. Late in May\r\nthe bondholders’ committee reported a plan which was considered by the\r\nbondholders at subsequent meetings. The principle was simple, and the\r\nmeans sufficient. The company had earned .4 per cent on its funded\r\ndebt:—_ergo_, the funded debt was to be swept away. Fixed charges had\r\nbeen heavy:—they were now to be completely removed. Scarcely less\r\nwould have met the needs of the situation, but the merit in refusing\r\nto tinker and experiment was considerable. In more extended shape the\r\nplan was as follows: Reorganization was to be carried out through\r\nforeclosure, and a committee of six was appointed to take charge. All\r\noutstanding bonds were to be replaced by preferred stock, and all\r\ncommon stock was to be exchanged for new common stock. Floating debt\r\nwas to be likewise exchanged for preferred stock, which was to be\r\nissued to the amount of $51,000,000 for the following purposes:\r\n\r\n(_a_) To retire the principal of the outstanding 7.3 per cent bonds,\r\nand the interest to and including July 1, 1878, at 8 per cent, currency.\r\n\r\n(_b_) To retire the land warrant bonds, principal and interest, to and\r\nincluding January 1, 1875.\r\n\r\n(_c_) To pay the floating debt not protected under the existing orders\r\nof the court.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Generally for the purpose of carrying the plan into effect.\r\n\r\nPreferred stock was to have all rights and privileges of common stock,\r\nwith the right to vote, and was to be entitled to 8 per cent out of\r\nnet earnings before anything should be paid on the common, and to\r\none-half the surplus after 8 per cent should have been declared on\r\nboth preferred and common.[550] It was to be convertible at par into\r\nany lands belonging to the company, or thereafter to belong to it, east\r\nof the Missouri River in the state of Minnesota or the territory of\r\nDakota, until default should occur in some of the provisions of the new\r\nfirst mortgage bonds, and the proceeds of all sales of such land were\r\nto be used in extinguishing the stock. Common stock was to be issued\r\nto the amount of $49,000,000, and was to be given to old stockholders\r\nshare for share. To provide the means to complete and to equip the road\r\nthere were to be issued first mortgage bonds not to exceed an average\r\nof $25,000 per mile of road, actually completed and accepted by the\r\nPresident of the United States, to be secured by a first mortgage on\r\nthe whole line of road, constructed or to be constructed, and on the\r\nequipment, property, lands, and franchises, including the franchise\r\nto be a corporation, subject only to the right of the holders of the\r\npreferred stock to convert their stock into lands. The principal was\r\nto be payable in forty years, and the interest and sinking fund might\r\nbe made payable in gold. No other bonds were to be issued except\r\non a vote of at least three-quarters of the preferred stock at a\r\nmeeting specially held in reference thereto on thirty days’ notice.\r\nSubsequently it was resolved, and the resolution incorporated in the\r\nplan, that the holders of the common stock should have no voting power\r\nuntil on and after July 1, 1878, and that no assessment should be\r\nlevied upon bondholders; but that the cost of purchase and the expense\r\nof foreclosure and other proceedings should be paid out of the assets\r\nand the income of the company.[551]\r\n\r\nApplying to this plan the same tests to which all other plans have been\r\nsubjected, it appears that from the point of view of the corporation\r\nit left little to be desired. The general depression throughout the\r\ncountry and the needs of the Northern Pacific Railroad in particular\r\nwere so great that for once, in the conflict of interests between the\r\nbondholders and the corporation, the latter had all the advantage on\r\nits side. As a matter of fact, had any attempt been made in this case,\r\nas so frequently in others of recent years, to unite in the exchange\r\nof new securities for old a bond and a stock as an equivalent for an\r\noutstanding bond, instead of giving stock only, the rate of interest\r\non the new bond would necessarily have been so low as to deprive the\r\ncombination of its attractiveness. That resource was not had to an\r\nincome bond was perhaps due to the absence of English investment in\r\nthe road. The wise course was the one pursued:—namely, to retire\r\nbonds with a fixed lien on earnings by stock which represented\r\nownership in the enterprise, and which could claim dividends only when\r\nearned. The floating debt was not retired by an assessment but by new\r\nsecurities. This again, all things considered, was wise. The existing\r\nstock represented so little actual investment in the property that\r\nholders would doubtless have refused to pay an assessment, and would\r\nhave surrendered their certificates instead; while it would have been\r\nboth difficult to collect an assessment on the depreciated bonds, and\r\nhard to convince bondholders of the justice of a demand for such a\r\ncontribution, so long as the stockholders were let off unscathed. On\r\nthe other hand, whether or not an assessment would have yielded cash,\r\nthe issue of stock for floating debt did not increase the fixed charges\r\nof the road, and was not, therefore, fundamentally unsound. Liberal\r\nprovision was made for future capital requirements, and the only\r\nprovision to which exception could have been taken was the limitation\r\nof bond issues to the moderate figure of $25,000 per mile except with\r\nthe consent of three-quarters of the preferred stockholders. On the\r\nwhole, the plan put the company fairly on its feet, presented it with\r\nall the work which had been accomplished, and bade it attempt again\r\nthe project in which its failure had previously been so complete. The\r\ndanger of future bankruptcy lay in this fact only: that a large section\r\nof the road was yet uncompleted, and through business was non-existent;\r\nthat the Northwest was still unsettled, and the local business was\r\nsmall; in short, that so much was yet to be done that the company, with\r\nall the advantages which it now possessed, might fail again for the\r\nsame reasons which had led it into bankruptcy before.\r\n\r\nThe plan was first reported on May 20,[552] and was laid before\r\nthe bondholders on the 30th of June. There was some protest that\r\nit proposed giving away the property of the bondholders, and the\r\nadditional sections before mentioned, concerning the expenses of the\r\nreorganization and the voting power of the common stock were added. By\r\nAugust nearly two-thirds of the bondholders had assented.[553] By May\r\na decree of sale had been obtained, which was modified in August so\r\nas to give bondholders priority over claims of directors for advances\r\nmade; and on August 12 all the property of the company, except the\r\npatented and certified lands,[554] with all its rights, liberties, and\r\nfranchises, was sold at public auction and bought in by a purchasing\r\ncommittee for $100,000.[555] No upset price was set by the Court; and\r\nit was surmised that the bid was purposely made low in order to force\r\nnon-assenting bondholders to accept the new stock. The new corporation\r\nwas organized in October, 1875, by the election of Mr. Chas. B. Wright\r\nof Philadelphia as president, and with the denial of a petition to set\r\naside the sale the reorganization may be said to have been concluded.\r\n\r\nFor fourteen years the company was now to be free from talk of\r\nfurther reorganization, and not until 1893 was there to be another\r\nreceivership. During this time the mileage, owned or controlled, was to\r\nbe made continuous from the Pacific coast to Chicago, and the Northern\r\nPacific was to mount high among American railroads in its extent and in\r\nthe volume of its business. In 1875 the completed mileage was, roughly,\r\n550 miles of line; in 1893 it was 5431.92, and reached from Ashland,\r\nSt. Paul, and Minneapolis on the east to Portland, Olympia, Tacoma,\r\nand Seattle on the west. In the former year the gross earnings were\r\n$414,722 and the net $97,478; in the latter the totals were $23,920,109\r\nand $11,416,283. At the same time the fixed charges rose from nothing\r\nto $14,311,430, and the bonds outstanding to $133,545,500, besides\r\n$15,349,000 of bonds of subsidiary companies guaranteed. It appears,\r\ntherefore, that the promoters were successful in raising funds for the\r\ncompletion of their enterprise, although their road suffered at first\r\nfrom the thin population of the Northwest and the lack of a through\r\nconnection, and then from the competition of other transcontinental\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nFrom the reorganization to 1879 very little was done in the way of new\r\nconstruction, owing to the general financial depression. Efforts to\r\nget the time allowed for completing the road extended failed, however,\r\nand it became necessary to resume in order to keep Congress contented\r\nand to avoid a forfeiture of the land grant. In 1878 a small loan was\r\nplaced, and the following year one for a somewhat larger amount; and\r\nwith the funds so secured construction was vigorously pushed. More\r\nliberal provision was made in 1880–1, when successful negotiations were\r\ncarried through for the sale to a syndicate of $40,000,000 general\r\nmortgage 6 per cent railroad and land-grant bonds, to be issued at\r\nthe rate of $25,000 per mile of finished road only, and to be secured\r\nby a mortgage on the entire property of the company except the lands\r\neast of the Missouri River, which were pledged for the redemption\r\nof the preferred stock. Provision was made for a reserve of these\r\nbonds sufficient to retire the prior issues before mentioned.[556]\r\nUnder the agreement the syndicate took $10,000,000 at once and had\r\nan option of taking $10,000,000 per year in each of the next three\r\nyears. The reported price was 90 for the first $10,000,000 and 92½ for\r\nthe rest. As a matter of fact, the whole $40,000,000 had been turned\r\nover by the end of 1883, and though the effect on the company is seen\r\nin the increase in its bonded indebtedness from $3,881,884 in 1880\r\nto $39,522,200 in 1883, and in its fixed charges from $334,482 to\r\n$2,478,939, it was meanwhile supplied with cash, and was enabled to\r\nadvance toward the completion of the 1000 miles of line which remained\r\nunbuilt. The financial embarrassment which was felt in 1882, in spite\r\nof the syndicate contract, was due to an unforeseen cause. According\r\nto the statements of the company, it was felt necessary, in order\r\nto avoid waste of time and money, to build simultaneously from both\r\nends of the line, and to start all the heavy work on the entire route\r\nat once. “This involved the shipment of millions of dollars’ worth\r\nof track material, motive power, and rolling stock to the Pacific\r\ncoast many months before their actual use on the road; and on the\r\nline east of the Rocky Mountains very large expenditures of cash a\r\nlong time before the works resulting from them could become parts of\r\nfinished road.”[557] The expenses were immediate;—the delivery of\r\nbonds to the syndicate could take place by the terms of the contract\r\nonly after the completion of finished sections of road, so that great\r\nstringency easily occurred between. The trouble was only temporary,\r\nand was tided over with the help of the syndicate and of the Oregon &\r\nTranscontinental Company, a corporation of which we shall presently\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\nAs the Northern Pacific pushed into the Northwest, and at the same\r\ntime vigorously occupied itself in filling the gap between the ends of\r\nits main line, it came into contact with a combination of Northwestern\r\ncompanies known as the Oregon Railway & Navigation Company, of which\r\nHenry Villard was at the time in control. This corporation owned a line\r\nof steamboats running on the Willamette and Columbia rivers in Oregon,\r\ntogether with an ocean line connecting Portland and San Francisco.[558]\r\nIn connection with the water routes a narrow-gauge road had been\r\nbuilt up the left bank of the Columbia River to a connection near the\r\nmouth of the Snake River with an existing narrow-gauge road to the\r\ntown of Walla Walla in Southeastern Washington; and this narrow-gauge\r\nwas being widened, in 1880, to standard. This was the very territory\r\nthrough which the Northern Pacific expected to make its connection with\r\nthe Pacific coast; and in 1880 it had passed the Rocky Mountains and\r\nhad reached the confluence of the Columbia and the Snake. On October\r\n20, 1880, a contract was signed between the Northern Pacific and the\r\nOregon Railway & Navigation Companies whereby the former, among other\r\nthings, consented to a division of territory with the Snake and the\r\nColumbia rivers as the dividing-line; in return for which the latter\r\nagreed to complete a standard-gauge road within three years from the\r\nwestern end of the Northern Pacific, at the mouth of the Snake River,\r\nto Portland, and to grant the Northern Pacific the right, without\r\nthe obligation, to run its own trains over it at a fixed charge per\r\ntrain mile. It will be remembered that the Northern Pacific was not at\r\nthis time too easy in its finances, so that it was quite willing to\r\nsecure connection with the coast without outlay of its own. Soon after\r\nthe execution of the contract, however, the $40,000,000 loan earlier\r\ndescribed was arranged for, and Mr. Villard feared that the road would\r\nbuild its own connection with Portland now that the means seemed to be\r\nat hand. To prevent it he conceived no less a plan than that of forming\r\na new company which should purchase and hold a controlling interest\r\nin both the Northern Pacific and the Oregon Railway & Navigation\r\nCompanies.[559] This was done, and the new corporation, known as the\r\nOregon & Transcontinental Company, for a long time played a prominent\r\npart in Northern Pacific affairs;[560] aiding it in the construction of\r\nthe main and branch lines, and time and again advancing money when the\r\nroad was in straits.[561]\r\n\r\nThe formation of the Oregon & Transcontinental Company put Mr. Villard\r\nin control of the Northern Pacific. Mr. Villard’s financial strength\r\nin later years was due mainly to the support of German interests,\r\nnotably the Deutsche Bank of Berlin; but his hold on the bank and on\r\nhis followers was partly due to his real ability and resourcefulness,\r\nand partly to his confident predictions of results which sometimes he\r\nwas but frequently was not able to attain. One of the company’s first\r\nacts after his appearance was the declaration of a scrip dividend upon\r\nthe preferred stock. The question had been raised in the course of\r\nhis fight for control, and he perhaps felt it incumbent upon himself\r\nto show the sincerity of his contentions; at any rate, the annual\r\nreport for 1882 contained a statement that the surplus earnings since\r\n1875 had been used for construction instead of being distributed as\r\ndividends, and that the sum of $4,667,490 was therefore properly due\r\nto the preferred stock. On the strength of this the directors resolved\r\nthat a dividend of 11.1 per cent be declared, for which there were\r\nto be issued obligations of the company bearing 6 per cent interest,\r\npayable at the end of five years, but redeemable after one year at the\r\npleasure of the company upon thirty days’ notice, in amounts of not\r\nless than 20 per cent to each holder. The policy thus initiated was\r\nplainly non-conservative and unsound. It may be true that as a general\r\nprinciple new construction should be paid for out of capital rather\r\nthan out of income account, yet this is subject to qualifications; and\r\nthe Northern Pacific had been and was in so precarious a condition\r\nthat not a dollar of its resources could safely have been alienated.\r\nThe sequel came in 1883 when the annual report admitted that there\r\nhad been an excess of expenditures on account of construction and\r\nequipment of $7,986,508 over the cash receipts from the proceeds of the\r\n$40,000,000 general mortgage bonds, sales of preferred stock, and other\r\nsources;[562] and when by October of the same year the deficit had been\r\nincreased to $9,459,921, and a circular from President Villard stated\r\nthe additional cash requirements to amount to $5,500,000.[563]\r\n\r\nRelief had to be sought in an increase of indebtedness. On October 6,\r\n1883, the directors authorized a second mortgage for $20,000,000 upon\r\nthe property, subject to the consent of three-fourths of the preferred\r\nstock, and in a circular explained that they had accepted a proposition\r\nof Drexel, Morgan & Co., Winslow, Lanier & Co., and August Belmont &\r\nCo. to take $15,000,000 of the issue at 87½, less 5 per cent commission\r\nin bonds, with a six months’ option to take $3,000,000 more on the\r\nsame terms. The stockholders assented,—they could do nothing else,—\r\na suit for an injunction was denied, and the syndicate exercised its\r\noption. The result was an increase in bonds issued from $39,522,200 to\r\n$61,635,400, of which the greater part was accounted for by the new\r\nmortgage.\r\n\r\nBy August 22, 1883, the gap in the Northern Pacific main line had been\r\nfilled up, and on September 8 the formal opening occurred. The mileage\r\nin operation was then 2365, of which 1952.5 was main line and 412.8\r\nbranches, and the rapid construction of the last 1000 miles had done\r\ncredit to most of those concerned. The total capitalization per mile\r\nwas $59,304, of which less than one-third represented bonds; and though\r\nthe following year this percentage was increased, the proportion of\r\nmortgage to total issues remained considerably under one-half. This\r\nshowing was very favorable, and accounts for the success with which\r\nthe Northern Pacific withstood the panic of 1884. With the completion\r\nof its through line, moreover, earnings increased so materially as to\r\ncover the interest on the new bonds; and though the road was never to\r\nenjoy a monopoly of transcontinental traffic, in February, 1883, it had\r\nconcluded an agreement with the Union Pacific concerning through rates\r\nand a division of territory, and a period of prosperity was hoped for.\r\nMeanwhile the Oregon & Transcontinental Company had been hard hit by\r\nthe decline in Northern Pacific stock, due to the publication of the\r\nconstruction deficit. The straits of his company affected Mr. Villard;\r\nand in spite of the relief afforded by the Northern Pacific second\r\nmortgage he “became conscious that neither himself nor the Oregon &\r\nTranscontinental Company could be saved.”[564] On January 4, 1884, the\r\ndirectors accepted his resignation, and soon after Robert Harris, then\r\nvice-president of the Erie, was elected to fill his place.[565]\r\n\r\nThe years immediately following the issue of the second mortgage and\r\nthe completion of the road were not uneventful, although it is not\r\nnecessary to describe them at length. The insolvency of the Oregon &\r\nTranscontinental, and continued disputes between it and the Northern\r\nPacific over an adjustment of the two companies’ financial relations,\r\nmade some other means of binding the Oregon Railway & Navigation\r\nwith the Northern Pacific seem advisable, and a lease of the former\r\ncompany to the latter was discussed. In July, 1884, an arrangement\r\nwas said to have been actually arrived at on the basis of a guarantee\r\nby the Northern Pacific of 6 per cent on the Navigation stock for two\r\nyears, 7 per cent for three years, and 8 per cent in perpetuity; but\r\nthe interest was very high, and an injunction helped to prevent a\r\nconsummation at the time. In 1885 the idea of a joint lease by the\r\nNorthern Pacific and Union Pacific railroad companies came to the\r\nfront. The Oregon Railway & Navigation was serving as the Northwestern\r\noutlet for both of these roads, and such a contract would have greatly\r\nsimplified the competitive situation, besides taking away from the\r\nNavigation Company the power to exact an excessive pro-rate because of\r\nits double connection.[566] During the next few years negotiations were\r\nalmost constantly in progress. In 1887, however, the Navigation Company\r\nwas leased to the Oregon Short Line with a Union Pacific guarantee; and\r\nupon the failure of renewed negotiations Mr. Villard, who was again in\r\npower, sold the Oregon & Transcontinental Company’s holdings of Oregon\r\nRailway & Navigation Company stock at a “satisfactory” price. This\r\nconsummation was less unfavorable to the Northern Pacific because of\r\nits completion of a line of its own to the Pacific coast.[567] From now\r\non the Oregon & Transcontinental Company existed only as a means of\r\nobtaining financial assistance for the Northern Pacific, and for making\r\nmore easy the control of that company’s stock.[568]\r\n\r\nWhile these operations were going on the Northern Pacific once more\r\nfound it advisable to increase its indebtedness, and added a third\r\nmortgage of $12,000,000 to the first and second mortgages which already\r\nhave been described. Of the issue $8,000,000 were at once taken by a\r\nsyndicate, and the $4,000,000 remaining were early disposed of to the\r\nsame parties. The mortgage was said to be for the purpose of completing\r\nnew work and for paying the floating debt; it also assisted in the\r\nredemption and refunding of the dividend scrip which had been issued to\r\npreferred stockholders in 1883; and the payment of $3,073,321 of this\r\nin cash, besides the extension of $1,567,500 more, now took place. The\r\nextended scrip was to be payable in 1907, to bear 6 per cent, and to\r\nbe redeemable on thirty days’ notice on any interest day on or after\r\n1892; and up to January 1, 1893, holders had the option of converting\r\nit into third mortgage bonds.[569] The third mortgage itself required\r\nthe consent of three-quarters of the preferred stockholders, but this\r\nthere seems to have been little difficulty in securing.\r\n\r\nThe years 1886–9 saw also a considerable extension of branch and other\r\nconstruction. It was a time of great general activity. In another\r\nplace the large additions to the Atchison system have been described;\r\nat the same time the Union Pacific grew from a system of 5825.6\r\nmiles in 1886 to one of 6996 in 1889, adding over 1100 miles; the\r\nChicago, Rock Island & Pacific increased from 1384.2 to 1592.7; the\r\nChicago, Burlington & Quincy from 4036 to 5140.8; and the St. Paul,\r\nMinneapolis & Manitoba from 1509.4 to 3030.1. Meanwhile the Northern\r\nPacific added 656.8 miles, or an average of 219 miles a year.[570] In\r\nthe far Northwest the great tunnel through the Cascade Mountains was\r\nnearly completed by May, 1888; and by the end of the following year\r\na continuous line of road was in operation from Ashland, Wisconsin,\r\nto Portland, Oregon, which was of particular service in view of the\r\ndifficulties with the Oregon Railway & Navigation Company, and was the\r\nreason for the willingness of the Northern Pacific to surrender control\r\nof that connection.[571] In 1888, also, negotiations were carried on\r\nwith the Canadian Government for an extension into Manitoba; and the\r\nsame year the Cœur d’Alene Railroad & Navigation Company was purchased,\r\ncomprising a steamship and narrow-gauge line in Northeastern Washington\r\nwhich extended through the mining region of the same name.[572]\r\nGenerally speaking, the Northern Pacific retained its character as a\r\nsingle-track transcontinental route with but few branches. Where it did\r\nexpand was on the east, where it reached Duluth, Ashland, Superior,\r\nSt. Paul, and Minneapolis, and on the west, where it joined Wallula,\r\nPortland, and Tacoma. The principal other branches were the ones\r\nmentioned: namely, those to Winnipeg, and to the mining districts in\r\nMontana and Washington.\r\n\r\nIn spite of its moderation the Northern Pacific was not\r\nover-prosperous. Its passenger earnings remained small, being scarcely\r\ngreater in 1888 than they had been in 1884; and while its freight\r\nearnings increased from $7,867,367 in 1884 to $10,426,245 in 1888, and\r\nto $15,600,320 in 1889, this was so far offset by increased operating\r\nexpenses that the increase in net earnings from both passengers and\r\nfreight was only $2,223,194. Construction meanwhile caused an increase\r\nin funded indebtedness outstanding of $15,202,000, to say nothing of\r\n$20,981,000 of branch-line bonds which the road by 1889 had guaranteed;\r\nand the floating debt began to grow uncomfortably large.[573] At the\r\nsame time, if Mr. Villard is to be believed, officials in charge of the\r\noperation of the road were eager for appropriations for the improvement\r\nof the track, the replacement of wooden by metal bridges, additional\r\nmotive power and rolling stock, enlargement of terminal facilities,\r\nand the purchase and construction of new lines. The truth was that the\r\nproblem of getting the road built had been more important than that of\r\nhow it was to be built; so that much work had been done in a hasty and\r\nimperfect manner which it was now advisable to renew.\r\n\r\nSince, then, there was need for additional capital, while it was unsafe\r\nto increase the fixed charges of the road, the managers felt called\r\nupon to devise a scheme whereby these circumstances should both, at\r\nleast in appearance, be met. Their solution was the proposal of a large\r\nrefunding mortgage to retire as soon as possible existing mortgages,\r\nand to provide a balance which could be spent upon the line. If, they\r\nargued, bondholders could be induced to accept new 4 per cent or even\r\n5 per cent bonds in exchange for their 6 per cent securities, the road\r\nwould be free to issue new additional bonds until the margin of charges\r\nso obtained should have been taken up. The plan was worthy of its\r\ningenious promoter, Mr. Villard, and will be criticised in the proper\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nOn September 19, 1889, the managers issued a circular to the preferred\r\nstockholders. “In the opinion of the Directors,” said they, “the\r\ntime has come to make new financial provision on a liberal scale\r\nfor the growing needs of the Company.” Then followed a statement of\r\ngross earnings. “A further corresponding increase may be expected\r\nin the present fiscal year, which will bring the gross earnings up\r\nto $23,000,000 or $24,000,000.... But the Company could not in the\r\npast, and will not be able hereafter, to take full advantage of this\r\nauspicious situation without further large investments of capital.\r\nSecondly.—The prosperity of the road attracts competition.... The\r\nCompany must be prepared to build additional feeders wherever and\r\nwhenever the local developments warrant, and the danger of hostile\r\noccupancy appears.... Another strong [motive] lies in the Company’s\r\nownership of a large land grant, the benefits of which cannot be fully\r\nrealized without the promotion of settlements through the construction\r\nof branch lines. The Board is also of opinion that the time has come to\r\nmake such provision, that the Company may take advantage of its high\r\ncredit to effect a reduction of fixed charges.”[574]\r\n\r\nIt was proposed to issue a $160,000,000 one hundred-year consolidated\r\nmortgage, bearing interest not to exceed 5 per cent, to cover the\r\nentire Northern Pacific Railroad, together with its equipment, land\r\ngrant, branch lines, and securities of branch lines. This was to be\r\napplied as follows:\r\n\r\n  For the retirement of $77,430,000 outstanding\r\n    first, second, and third mortgage bonds         $75,000,000\r\n\r\n  For the retirement of the existing $26,000,000\r\n    branch bonds                                     26,000,000\r\n\r\n  For additional branches at a rate per mile not\r\n    over $30,000                                     20,000,000\r\n\r\n  For enlargement of terminals and stations,\r\n    additional rolling stock, betterments and\r\n    renewals, and other expenses not properly\r\n    chargeable to operating expenses                 20,000,000\r\n\r\n  For premiums on bonds exchanged                    10,000,000\r\n\r\n  For general purposes                                9,000,000[575]\r\n\r\nOnly a portion of these securities was, therefore, to be issued at\r\nonce. The provision for enlargement of terminals, etc., was likely\r\nto call for early issues, as might a portion of that reserved for\r\nnew branches and for general purposes. It was expected that a certain\r\namount of branch-line bonds could be retired without much delay. On\r\nthe whole, the bonds immediately put forth were not expected to exceed\r\n$15,000,000; though there was nothing in the plan to prevent a greater\r\nissue. The interest rate was “not to exceed 5 per cent.” That this\r\nwording was deliberately adopted is shown by the terms of the mortgage,\r\nwhich expressly gave to the company the power to issue the new bonds,\r\nfrom time to time, bearing such a rate of interest as the managers\r\nmight think advisable up to 5 per cent. It was understood that the\r\nissue was to be in three classes, one of $57,000,000 to bear 5 per\r\ncent, one of $23,000,000 to bear 4½ per cent, and one of $80,000,000 to\r\nbear 4 per cent; and on this basis it was thought that fixed charges\r\nwould be reduced $2,000,000, to which would have to be added interest\r\non bonds issued in excess of those previously outstanding.[576] The\r\nreserve of $10,000,000 for premiums shows that in the opinion of the\r\ndirectors the offer of substantially more than par in new bonds was\r\nnecessary in order to induce exchanges of old bonds for new. To prevent\r\ncareless use of this reserve it was provided that the $10,000,000 in\r\nbonds could be used to pay premiums only upon the affirmative vote of\r\nat least nine members (out of thirteen) of the board, and when in the\r\nopinion of the trustees, expressed in writing, a saving of interest to\r\nthe company could be effected.\r\n\r\nNot the least important part of the plan was that designed to gain\r\nthe preferred stockholders’ approval. It will be remembered that by\r\nthe terms of the reorganization of 1875 the consent of three-quarters\r\nof these stockholders was necessary to validate any mortgage after\r\nthe first mortgage then proposed. The increase in indebtedness now\r\nsuggested threatened to postpone indefinitely dividends on the\r\npreferred, and could not be expected to be welcome. In consequence, the\r\ndirectors offered three distinct inducements: first, a promise of a\r\ndistribution to the preferred stockholders of sums which had been taken\r\nfrom earnings and spent on the property to date; second, a promise\r\nof early and regular dividends in the future; third, a preferential\r\nright of subscription to the new bonds. By resolution of August 21,\r\n1889, they therefore definitely declared in favor of the distribution\r\nof a sum equal to the earnings which should be found to have been\r\napplied in earlier years to the capital requirements of the property.\r\nAn investigation was made, the amount was officially declared to be\r\n$2,844,430, and an equivalent amount of new bonds at 85 was set aside\r\nto cover it. For the future Mr. Villard and his associates announced a\r\ndetermination to begin dividends at the rate of 4 per cent, the first\r\nto be paid January 1, 1890; and declared that thereafter dividends\r\nwould be paid out of the current net earnings, or, if these should\r\nbe insufficient, out of a reserve fund until the net earnings should\r\njustify a larger distribution. Finally, it was provided that the common\r\nand preferred stockholders should be given the privilege of subscribing\r\nto the new bonds at 85 to the extent of 15 per cent of their holdings.\r\nThat these concessions attracted attention was shown by the action\r\nof the preferred stockholders in calling for an actual distribution\r\nas soon as possible of the amounts deducted from earnings in past\r\nyears. On October 17, 1889, they passed a resolution recommending\r\nto the incoming board of directors “to take into consideration the\r\ndistribution of the whole amount due to the Preferred Stock, under the\r\nplan of reorganization, as soon as the Company shall be financially in\r\na proper position to do so;”[577] and again the following year they\r\nresolved “that the incoming Board of Directors be ... requested to set\r\napart the additional earnings in ... consolidated bonds ... and to\r\n(consider) the question of either increasing the ... dividend above 4\r\nper cent or of declaring an extra dividend to the preferred stock.”[578]\r\n\r\nAll things considered it is improbable that the refunding plan could\r\nhave been put through without the promise of dividends to the preferred\r\nstock, but it remains unfortunate that such promises had to be made.\r\nThe money which had been put into the road had been of necessity so\r\ninvested to preserve the solvency of the company. In a sense it had\r\nincreased earning power, but not all expenditures which affect earnings\r\nmay be charged to capital. In the first place, if earnings are below\r\nfixed charges, or are constantly tending to fall below, sums put into\r\nthe property merely assist the company to keep its head above water,\r\nand are not a sound basis for an increase in indebtedness; and in the\r\nsecond place expenditures which serve to _preserve_ earnings may not\r\nbe charged to capital account, even when the method of preservation is\r\nthe construction of branch lines, and still less when the method is\r\nthe improvement of the existing plant. If, then, as was the case, the\r\nearnings claimed by the preferred stockholders had gone to preserve\r\nthe solvency of the company, and to defend it against competition, the\r\narguments of these stockholders in 1889 did not hold good.\r\n\r\nAs for the plan itself, it was simply a method for providing new\r\ncapital, and should be judged as such. Its refunding provisions were\r\nmainly misleading. It proposed to secure a reduction in fixed charges\r\nby the exchange of bonds bearing 5 per cent or less for bonds bearing 6\r\nper cent, but how the reduction was to be accomplished was not clear.\r\nThe maturity of the bonds to be retired was remote, and the assured\r\nreduction was therefore also remote. The first mortgage had been issued\r\nin 1881, and ran for forty years; the second dated from 1882 and was\r\nto mature after fifty years; and the third, which had been issued\r\nonly the year before, was not redeemable until 1937. The Missouri\r\ndivision and Pend d’Oreille mortgages matured somewhat earlier,[579]\r\nbut had nevertheless a considerable time to run. The mortgage issues\r\nwould therefore not soon fall in of themselves. Secondly, bondholders\r\nwould evidently not consent voluntarily to surrender old unexpired\r\nbonds without such a premium in new bonds as would make their annual\r\nreturn approximately the same. Something they might concede in view\r\nof the more remote maturity of the new issue and the somewhat more\r\ninclusive character of its mortgage lien, but not enough to create any\r\nconsiderable saving.[580] The new issues for improvement of the road,\r\nmoreover, involved an _increase_ in the annual interest payments; which\r\nwe must not, perhaps, condemn offhand, for the raising of capital\r\nwas in some measure forced upon the company, but which is important\r\nin considering the railroad’s financial condition and prospects. The\r\nfact was that the Northern Pacific was not self-supporting; it had\r\nbeen obliged to issue $20,867,000 bonds of its own and to guarantee\r\n$20,981,000 besides, between 1884 and 1889, in order to secure an\r\nadvance of $2,462,288 in annual net income during a period of rapidly\r\nincreasing prosperity; and it was now obliged to increase this\r\nindebtedness in the attempt to maintain its solvency for the future.\r\n\r\nBetween 1889 and the end of 1892 business increased, and net earnings\r\nat first gained more rapidly than did fixed charges. Mr. Villard was\r\nagain supreme in the management, and actively directed financial\r\noperations until his departure for Europe in 1890. The most important\r\noperation conducted was the lease of the Wisconsin Central, whereby\r\nthe eastern terminus of the Northern Pacific system was transferred\r\nfrom St. Paul and Minneapolis to Chicago. The directors who were\r\nelected with Mr. Villard in 1887 controlled the Wisconsin Central and\r\nthe Terminal Company, which had been formed to secure an entrance for\r\nthat road into the Lake city.[581] Perhaps because of this financial\r\ninterest, the conviction seems to have crept over them that the\r\nNorthern Pacific would do well to make connection with the trunk lines\r\nat Chicago, instead of stopping further west; and they brought the\r\nsubject up in 1889, and again in 1890. On July 1, 1889, a traffic\r\ncontract went into effect, under which the Northern Pacific obtained\r\nthe use of the Wisconsin Central lines in consideration of the business\r\nwhich it should turn over to them. Certain provisions imposed on both\r\nroads a share of the operating expenses whenever the proportion of\r\noperating expenses to gross earnings was greater than 65 per cent, and\r\nwhich gave both a profit whenever the proportion fell below this level.\r\nThe Wisconsin Central retained entire and absolute control of its own\r\nproperty, except that the Northern Pacific was to share in the profits\r\nof the subsidiary Terminal Company whenever these profits should be\r\nmore than $800,000.[582] This was considered unsatisfactory, because\r\nthe Northern Pacific had no control of the Central’s operation; and\r\non April 1 of the following year a new contract gave to the former a\r\nlease of all the lines owned and controlled by the Wisconsin Central\r\nCompany and the Wisconsin Central Railroad Company between St. Paul\r\nand Chicago for 999 years; including terminal facilities at Chicago\r\nheld by the Chicago & Northern Pacific Railroad Company, a subsidiary\r\ncorporation.[583] “It was deemed by the Board,” said the annual report,\r\n“as of the utmost importance that your road should have access to the\r\ncity of Chicago by a line in its own ownership and possessed with\r\nterminal facilities which it could control and have possession of.\r\nThe whole subject was most carefully considered by the Board, and\r\nthe contracts and leases were adopted after deliberate and careful\r\nconsideration.”[584] The advantage of this lease to the Wisconsin\r\nCentral lay in the large volume of traffic which the arrangement\r\nsecured to it; that to the Northern Pacific was more doubtful.\r\nConnection with Chicago was desirable, but it was to prove difficult to\r\noperate the Wisconsin Central for 65 per cent, and the acquisition was\r\nto arouse the hostility of all the other roads between Chicago and St.\r\nPaul. We shall see that the lease was presently given up and that the\r\nattempt to make Chicago the eastern terminus was for the time abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe year 1891 was a good one, but during the following twelve months\r\nthe situation changed for the worse. Most noteworthy was an increase\r\nin fixed charges of over $2,000,000, due in part to an increase in the\r\nfunded indebtedness, but more largely to an increase in rentals paid.\r\nThis increase brought charges above total net income, and shows how\r\nserious the position of the company had become. In fact, the company’s\r\nrepeated issues of bonds had failed so completely to put it in a stable\r\nposition that in but three of the nine years from 1884 to 1892 was a\r\nsurplus greater than $500,000 above fixed payments secured, while the\r\noperations of two of these same years resulted in a deficit.\r\n\r\nThe first admission by directors that the road was in difficulty\r\nconsisted in the passing of the preferred stock dividend for March 31,\r\n1892. That this action did not deprive the holders of all return was\r\ndue to the previous conversion of the consols formerly reserved into a\r\ntrust for ten years on which to draw whenever the road should be unable\r\nto pay the usual dividends. The directors therefore added to their\r\ndeclaration of suspension a resolution that the “time, manner, and\r\nmethod of the distribution of so many of the $3,347,000 of consolidated\r\nbonds set aside for the benefit of the preferred stockholders as may be\r\nnecessary to supply the deficiency, if any, in this or any subsequent\r\nfiscal year, between the amount of net earnings and 4 per cent on\r\nthe preferred stock, be submitted to preferred stockholders at the\r\nannual meeting in October next.”[585] Not unnaturally stockholders\r\nwere alarmed. At the annual meeting in October an investigating\r\ncommittee was appointed,[586] and proceeded to a careful examination\r\nof the property accompanied by certain officers of the road. The\r\ncommittee was not friendly to the management. Its preliminary report\r\nannounced that the physical condition of the system was good, but its\r\nlater criticism of the company’s financial condition was severe. In\r\nthe words of the London _Standard_ “there has been no such scathing\r\narraignment of Directors since the exposures of the Erie Railway.” The\r\ncommittee stated that the bad condition of the property was due to the\r\nreckless financial methods of the directors. It alleged that officers\r\nhad held dual positions, and had subordinated the interests of the\r\nNorthern Pacific Company to those of the Wisconsin Central, relieving\r\nthemselves at the expense of the former road. It commented upon the\r\nunprofitable character of certain of the other branches. The floating\r\ndebt, it maintained, had been financed by Mr. Villard personally at\r\ndouble the current rates of interest, and it recommended litigation\r\nin default of some assurance that the policy of the company should\r\nbe changed.[587] In reply the directors issued a lengthy statement\r\ntaking up the charges in detail. The policy of building branch lines,\r\nsaid they, was imperatively necessary in order to develop business.\r\nAlthough some of the branches had not earned their fixed charges, yet,\r\nif they had been credited with 60 per cent of the gross earnings on\r\nbusiness which they had brought to the main line, they would have shown\r\na good profit. The policy of branch-line construction had met with the\r\nunanimous approval of successive boards of directors, and had been\r\nratified by the stockholders in 1886; and in this connection the reply\r\ndefended specifically the acquisition of the Wisconsin Central and\r\nother lines. The carrying of the floating debt by officials interested\r\nin the property, instead of being subject to criticism and censure, was\r\nentitled to the highest commendation.[588]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to pass with justice upon the conflicting contentions\r\nabove outlined. However, writing in 1905, long after his retirement\r\nfrom Northern Pacific affairs, Mr. Villard expressed himself as\r\nfollows: “In 1891 Mr. Villard ... made ... his last official tour of\r\ninspection of the main line and principal branches of the Northern\r\nPacific.... The most alarming impression of all made upon him was the\r\nrevelation of the weight of the load that had been put upon the company\r\nby the purchase and construction of the longer branch lines in Montana\r\nand Washington, which he then discovered for the first time. There\r\nwas the Missoula branch to the Cœur d’Alene mines; the Cœur d’Alene\r\nRailway & Navigation, a mixed system of steamboats and rail lines; the\r\nSeattle, Lake Shore & Eastern; and the roads built into Westernmost\r\nWashington; representing a total investment in cash and bonds of not\r\nfar from $30,000,000, which together hardly earned operating expenses.\r\nThe acquisition and building of these disappointing lines had in a\r\nfew years absorbed the large amount of consolidated bonds set aside\r\nfor construction purposes, which had been assumed to be sufficient\r\nfor all needs in that direction for a long time.”[589] No man should\r\nhave known the real profitableness of these extensions better than Mr.\r\nVillard; and the circumstances of his account give it special weight.\r\nThe admitted fact that in several cases the managers of the Northern\r\nPacific voted as directors of that corporation to buy property from\r\nthemselves as whole or part owners in other enterprises also excites\r\ndistrust, and this feeling is strengthened by the unsatisfactory\r\nfinancial condition in 1893 of the Northern Pacific system as a whole.\r\n\r\nEven before the report of the investigating committee the directors\r\nhad been busy with the floating debt. This amounted to $9,918,000 late\r\nin 1892, according to the treasurer’s statement. In February, 1893,\r\nit was decided to cancel it by the sale of the stock of the St. Paul\r\n& Northern Pacific held in the treasury, but this aroused violent\r\nopposition. The St. Paul & Northern Pacific ran, it will be remembered,\r\nfrom Brainerd to St. Paul and Minneapolis, and had formed the eastern\r\nterminus of the Northern Pacific system until the acquisition of the\r\nWisconsin Central. It was justly considered an extremely important\r\nsection of the main line, and the possible loss of its control was\r\nregarded as disastrous.[590] Dissuaded from their first purpose, the\r\ndirectors considered the issue of a collateral mortgage sufficient in\r\namount to relieve all pressing necessities, and proposed to utilize\r\nin this way treasury securities which it would have been unwise to\r\nsell. At the same time the stockholders’ committee had much the same\r\nidea in mind, and wrote to President Oakes in March, and again in May.\r\n“Referring to my letter to you of March 15,” said Brayton Ives, “I beg\r\nto say that the financial plan therein referred to contemplates the\r\ncreation of a collateral trust in which shall be placed $10,000,000\r\nNorthern Pacific consolidated 5s, $3,000,000 Chicago & Northern Pacific\r\nfirsts, and all of the St. Paul & Northern Pacific stock belonging to\r\nthe Northern Pacific Company, estimated at $7,000,000. Against these\r\nsecurities it is suggested that notes to the extent of $12,000,000 be\r\nissued, bearing 6 per cent interest, and payable in five years, or\r\nbefore, at the pleasure of the company, provision being made at the\r\nsame time for the increase of the amount of the notes to $15,000,000\r\non the deposit of additional collateral securities satisfactory to\r\nthe underwriters. I am happy to be able to repeat the belief already\r\nexpressed, that if the board of directors will allow the underwriters\r\nto name seven directors of the company the entire amount of notes\r\nwill be subscribed for without delay.”[591] This plan was backed by\r\nresponsible houses, including the Mercantile Trust Company, Kuhn, Loeb\r\n& Co., the Equitable Life Assurance Company, and others, who agreed to\r\ntake $7,000,000 of the new bonds at 95, less 1½ per cent commission.\r\nThe directors paid no attention to Mr. Ives’s letter, and his offer was\r\nsubsequently withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe directors’ own scheme was dated May 1, 1893. It provided for a\r\ncollateral five-year 6 per cent mortgage to the amount of $15,000,000,\r\nof which $12,000,000 were to be issued at once. There was to be a\r\ncommittee of five which should take charge of the issue, and which\r\nmight sell the collateral before the maturity of the notes at certain\r\nminimum prices or over. Until all the notes should have been paid the\r\nrailroad company agreed not to undertake the construction of any new\r\nlines without the consent of the committee, or to purchase or lease any\r\nrailroad or navigation lines, or to guarantee, endorse, or purchase the\r\nbonds or other obligations or stocks of other companies. The committee\r\nwas to have the voting power on the underlying stocks, and might\r\ndirect the trust company to waive any default of the railroad company\r\nin payment of interest. The railroad company might call in the notes\r\nbefore maturity, after May 1, 1896, and pay them off at par and accrued\r\ninterest.[592] This, it will be seen, did not differ in essence from\r\nthe scheme proposed by Mr. Ives:—the real contest was between parties\r\nand not between plans. In June, Mr. Villard resigned his position as\r\ndirector and chairman of the board, and J. D. Rockefeller was elected\r\na director. Somewhat earlier, but doubtless in anticipation of this\r\naction, a syndicate agreed to underwrite the collateral issue, subject\r\nto the stockholders’ right of subscription;[593] and by the end of the\r\nyear $10,275,000 of the collateral notes were outstanding, of which\r\nthe bulk had been taken by the syndicate.[594] The whole device was\r\nvery similar to that employed by the Union Pacific in 1891. It was not\r\ndesigned as a permanent remedy for anything, but served to postpone a\r\nreckoning to what was hoped would be better times. As a matter of fact\r\nits effect was very small.\r\n\r\nReceivers for the Northern Pacific Railroad Company were appointed\r\nAugust 15, 1893, on a petition alleging that the company was insolvent\r\nand had no funds to meet payments coming due on September 1, October\r\n1, November 1, and December 1. The company in its answer admitted the\r\nfacts, and the United States Circuit Court at Milwaukee, Wisconsin,\r\nput Messrs. Henry C. Payne, Thomas F. Oakes, and Henry C. Rouse in\r\ncharge of its affairs.[595] Receivers were rapidly appointed for most\r\nof the branch lines, the intent being to put all these properties in\r\nseparate hands.[596] The receivers of the main line had nothing to\r\ndo with the branches, although in November they were authorized to\r\nenter into temporary traffic agreements with them. In regard to the\r\nWisconsin Central, application was early made to compel the Northern\r\nPacific to carry out the provisions of the lease; but Judge Jenkins of\r\nthe Milwaukee court granted the receivers until September 15 to decide\r\nwhether or not they desired to continue, and upon their negative reply\r\nauthorized a surrender. The accounts submitted, he said, showed that\r\nsince the lease had gone into effect the Chicago & Northern Pacific had\r\nbeen operated at a loss to the Northern Pacific of $1,304,169 and the\r\nWisconsin Central at a loss of $1,142,316; although business during the\r\nthree years in question had been generally prosperous. In accordance\r\nwith the decision the property was turned over to the Wisconsin\r\nCompany on September 26, 1893, and the Northern Pacific for a time gave\r\nup the idea of a Chicago terminus. Of the other leases those of the St.\r\nPaul & Northern Pacific and of the Cœur d’Alene Railway & Navigation\r\nCompany were at this time approved by the court, and the receivers were\r\nauthorized to make the necessary payments.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the Northern Pacific was the signal for still more\r\nactive and bitter personal struggles between opposing factions than\r\nhad before occurred. The opposition, led by Brayton Ives and August\r\nBelmont, endeavored to get control of the company through the annual\r\nelection on October 19, and to procure the removal of the appointed\r\nreceivers. They displayed the greatest bitterness toward Mr. Villard,\r\nand held him responsible for the position in which the company was\r\nplaced. Villard’s “remarkable qualities,” wrote Ives, “have been of\r\nadvantage only to himself.... The syndicate composed of Villard, Colby,\r\nAbbott, and Hoyt, and their friends made millions [by the Wisconsin\r\nCentral deal] and the Northern Pacific has suffered and is suffering a\r\ncorresponding loss.”[597] Circulars were sent out asking proxies, and\r\nAugust Belmont, J. Horace Harding, Brayton Ives, Donald Mackay, and\r\nWinthrop Smith were appointed a committee to receive proxies as they\r\ncame in. On the other side the directors appealed to the stockholders,\r\nreminded them that though the company had failed while they were in\r\noffice it was also during their term that it had reached its greatest\r\nprosperity, and took the cautious step of amending the by-laws so as to\r\nshorten the term of future boards from three years to one. Conditions\r\nwere against the management, and the result of the election was a\r\ncomplete victory for the Belmont-Ives party, which was followed up by\r\nthe choice of Mr. Ives for president. The real results were less than\r\nmight be supposed, for the operation of the railroad and the control of\r\nits funds were to be in the hands of the receivers and not in those of\r\nthe officers of the road. On January 20 President Ives filed a petition\r\nin the Milwaukee Federal Court for an order directing the receivers to\r\nsurrender the seal, books and papers and stock certificates, and to pay\r\nover sufficient money to enable the president to rent rooms and pay the\r\nsalaries of the auditor, secretary, and treasurer.[598] The petition\r\nwas denied, and the elected officers were left in an anomalous position.\r\n\r\nIn other matters the opposition lost no time in appealing to the\r\ncourts. Previous even to the election two actions had been begun\r\nagainst Henry Villard: the one in September by John Swope of\r\nPhiladelphia to compel Henry Villard and others to restore stock and\r\nbonds obtained as a result of an illegal conspiracy:[599] the other\r\na petition in October by the Northern Pacific Company to force the\r\nreceivers to bring suit against Messrs. Villard, Hoyt, and Colby to\r\nrecover nearly $2,600,000 alleged to have been made unlawfully through\r\nNorthern Pacific deals.[600] The complaints were in the main the same\r\nas those which had been made by the investigating committee, and\r\ncharged, _inter alia_, that Villard had secured a profit to himself\r\nby bringing about the purchase of the Chicago terminal properties by\r\nthe Northern Pacific. Mr. Villard swore that his whole interest in the\r\ntransaction had been as officer and stockholder and securityholder\r\nof the Northern Pacific Company,[601] and the receivers professed\r\nthemselves ready and willing to bring suit, provided they were\r\nfurnished with the information and evidence wherewith to prosecute\r\nthe same.[602] The Court reserved the Ives motion for further\r\nconsideration, and the following year directed the receivers to bring\r\nsuit; but the litigation was eventually dropped.[603]\r\n\r\nIn December, 1893, the Ives faction filed a petition for the removal of\r\nthe receivers. The charges were in part similar to those of the Swope\r\nsuit. It was asserted that at the time the receivers were appointed\r\nthe road had practically had no hearing; that its managers had in\r\nless than a year burdened it with the interest of $60,000,000 for\r\nproperties which were of no value to it, but in many of which they\r\nwere personally interested and out of which they made large profits,\r\nand that when insolvency was produced by this fraud they had put the\r\nroad in the hands of receivers nominated by them for the purpose, with\r\nthe effect of perpetuating the same control which had brought the\r\nbankruptcy. Specific charges were made against Oakes, Villard, and\r\nRoswell C. Rolston, president of the Farmers’ Loan & Trust Company;\r\nno charges were made against Receivers Payne and Rouse, but their\r\nremoval was asked for because they happened to be in the company of\r\nand presumably in the interest of Mr. Oakes. Besides this, finally, it\r\nwas alleged that separate receivers had been unnecessarily appointed\r\nfor branch lines, and that the expense of administering the affairs of\r\nthe company had been enormously increased.[604] The receivers filed\r\nlengthy answers on February 3; Receiver Oakes in particular answering\r\nevery charge specifically, filing exhaustive documents in proof, and\r\nmaintaining in general the value of the branch properties and his\r\ninnocence of unlawful profits.[605] The court on the whole inclined\r\nto his view. On April 14 Judge Jenkins handed down his decision,\r\ndismissing the petition for the removal of Messrs. Payne and Rouse, and\r\nholding Mr. Oakes’s conduct to have been above investigation except in\r\nthree instances, to examine which a master was appointed.[606] In the\r\ncourse of his decision Judge Jenkins concluded that the branch lines\r\nin question, though unprofitable for a while, were necessary to the\r\nsystem; and that in particular the branches in Washington, Oregon,\r\nMontana, and Idaho were built as feeders, and owing to the sparsely\r\nsettled district were necessarily built for the future. If Mr. Oakes\r\nwere to be removed on these charges, said he, then it would make\r\nthe entire board of directors of the company at that time liable to\r\nimpeachment.[607] Mr. Cary, the master, reported that Mr. Oakes had had\r\nno pecuniary interest and no personal advantage or gain from any of\r\nthe matters referred to him for investigation. Mr. Villard was said to\r\nhave made unlawful gains in the acquisition of the Northern Pacific &\r\nManitoba Company to the extent of $363,494, but Mr. Oakes did not know\r\nthat Mr. Villard was so interested, and was not bound to take notice\r\nto prevent such gains.[608] In consequence, Judge Jenkins in October\r\ngranted a motion to dismiss the petition for the removal of Oakes as\r\nreceiver,[609] and the incident was closed.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that Mr. Ives and his friends obtained but little\r\nsatisfaction in the courts up to this point. They were unable to\r\nforce the receivers to turn over any share of the Northern Pacific’s\r\nearnings, and they were equally unable to remove the receivers from\r\noffice. So long as the road should remain in the receivers’ hands their\r\nauthority seemed destined to be nominal, and they were thus spurred on\r\nby their own private interests to make some attempt at reorganization.\r\nAt the same time their opponents, as bondholders, were not unwilling\r\nto receive some interest on their bonds, and succeeded in this, as in\r\nother matters, in drawing substantial control into their own hands.\r\nThe year 1894 was a bad one and made the importance of a reduction in\r\nfixed charges loom large. Passenger earnings decreased from $5,917,054\r\nto $3,960,772, and freight earnings from $17,017,630 to $11,418,692;\r\nwhile in spite of attempted economies by the receivers, net earnings\r\ndecreased by almost the same absolute amount.[610] Cuts in wages were\r\ninevitable, and a serious strike aggravated the situation. It became\r\nnecessary to borrow money from the Adams Reorganization Committee, of\r\nwhich more will be said later, and to issue $5,000,000 in receivers’\r\ncertificates to pay off $5,000,000 already authorized in 1893. On\r\nSeptember 8 formal announcement was made that the receiverships of\r\nthe twenty-four branch lines of the Northern Pacific system were\r\nto be terminated, and that the trustee was to undertake the legal\r\nmanagement of all the lines for a stated sum per annum; while the\r\ngeneral receivers, Messrs. Oakes, Rouse, and Payne, were to operate\r\nthe separated lines under a fair traffic agreement. It was figured\r\nthat $64,000 per annum would be saved; and further economies were made\r\nin the cost of the administrative staff at New York. The relief was\r\ninsufficient. Net earnings for 1894 were $5,506,007, and fixed charges\r\nwere $12,004,985, and the need of a reorganization was impressively\r\nshown.\r\n\r\nThe work of devising a reorganization plan was done in the various\r\nbondholders’ committees. Late in 1893 a committee of consolidated 5\r\nper cent bondholders had been formed, with E. D. Adams as chairman and\r\nGeneral Louis Fitzgerald as vice-chairman; which declared itself to be\r\nindependent, but was regarded as affiliated with the former managers\r\nof the road. In March, 1894, this committee announced that, having\r\nreceived responses from the holders of a majority of the consolidated\r\nbonds, it had prepared an agreement and had secured its acceptance by\r\nthe German bondholders. All consolidated bondholders were requested\r\nto deposit their securities with the Mercantile Trust Company, which\r\nwould issue engraved certificates of deposit, which the committee would\r\nendeavor to have listed on the Stock Exchange. Mr. Ives was opposed to\r\nany step toward reorganization of this sort, and objected particularly\r\nto the composition of the committee; he therefore asked bondholders to\r\nwithhold their acceptance of the agreement, and gave various reasons\r\nto lend weight to his request. In April, as a counter-move, he invited\r\nbondholders to send in their names and addresses to him, together\r\nwith the amount of their holdings, saying that this action would not\r\ncommit the bondholders, and was desired only to enable the company to\r\nfurnish information respecting its affairs, and, when the proper time\r\nshould arise, to confer about a reorganization plan. The rapid falling\r\noff in earnings soon imperilled the interest of the second and third\r\nmortgage bonds, superior to the consolidated mortgage. In July the\r\nAdams Committee appealed to the holders of these issues, and secured\r\na considerable number of deposits. Henceforth it planned to act as a\r\ngeneral reorganization committee. On the other hand a committee headed\r\nby Johnston Livingston competed for deposits of the second mortgage,\r\nand one headed by C. B. Van Nostrand for deposits of the third mortgage\r\nbonds. It was urged that holders of the earlier issues should not\r\ndeposit with the consolidated committee, because its interest lay in\r\ncutting down prior liens; whereas the Van Nostrand Committee declared\r\nthat the road could earn the interest on the third mortgage, and that\r\nthese bonds should not accept less than par and interest in cash.\r\nNevertheless the Deutsche Bank’s London agency announced in September\r\nthat it was prepared to receive second mortgage, third mortgage, and\r\nconsolidated bonds on behalf of the Adams Committee, and to forward the\r\nsame to New York for deposit. Various rumors were afloat at this time\r\nconcerning reorganization, and suggestions were made for converting the\r\nthird mortgage bonds into 5 per cent income bonds and the consolidated\r\nbonds into preferred stock;[611] but the only result was to stir up\r\nprotests from the third mortgage bondholders, who still insisted in\r\nAugust that earnings were more than sufficient to pay the interest on\r\nall prior liens. Late in the year there was talk of selling the road\r\nunder foreclosure of the second mortgage, but this too came to nothing.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the operation of the road went on. Receiver Rouse reported\r\non the condition of the property in January, 1894. He estimated that\r\n$10,000,000 would be required to bring the permanent way into the most\r\neffective condition for economical operation. Exceptional causes,\r\nsaid he, had contributed to make the earnings for the previous three\r\nyears exceptionally large, and this fact, together with the prevailing\r\ndepression, the competition of the Great Northern, and reduced rates,\r\nwould decrease the gross earnings in the immediate future at least 27\r\nper cent. Although Mr. Rouse believed in the value of the Northern\r\nPacific’s branch lines, his report was not encouraging.[612] In\r\nSeptember, on the approach of the annual election, President Ives\r\nissued a long circular. The serious decrease in the earnings of\r\nthe road, he said, had affected for the worse the position of the\r\nstockholders, and these holders should understand that no one of the\r\nreorganization committees was working for their interest. He announced\r\nthe appointment of a committee to receive proxies, and revealed the\r\nembarrassment of the management by a request for contributions of\r\n$12.50 per hundred shares in order to pay the expenses of the officers.\r\nSo far as the officers should have any voice in the matter, President\r\nIves assured the stockholders, contributions should be credited on any\r\nassessments which might be made thereafter. On the day of the election\r\nno opposing ticket was presented, and the Ives party were reëlected\r\nto their positions. This is where matters stood at the beginning of\r\n1895. The hostility of the opposing committees was in no way abated;\r\nbut the Adams Committee had secured deposits of nearly $21,000,000 of\r\nthe consolidated mortgage bonds, $1,000,000 more than a majority of the\r\nthird mortgage bonds,[613] and $3,000,000 less than a majority of the\r\nsecond mortgage bonds, and with the hearty support of the Deutsche\r\nBank was steadily strengthening its position.[614]\r\n\r\nIn May, 1895, the Adams Committee reorganization plan came out and\r\nmarked the first serious suggestion for a rehabilitation of the\r\nproperty. It proposed a sale, under foreclosure, of the old company\r\nand the formation of a new company under special arrangements for this\r\npurpose. The new company was to issue $100,000,000 in shares, and a\r\nmaximum of $200,000,000 in gold bonds free from taxation, secured by\r\na mortgage lien on the whole Northern Pacific system, including the\r\nSt. Paul & Northern Pacific Railway, and bearing interest partly at\r\n4 per cent and partly at 3 per cent, all under the same mortgage.\r\nA sufficient amount of these bonds was to be reserved to replace\r\nthe existing first mortgage, besides a further amount to acquire\r\nindependent branch lines or for new construction at a maximum charge\r\nof $20,000 per mile. The principal and interest of the new bonds were\r\nto be guaranteed unconditionally by the Great Northern Road, in return\r\nfor which the Great Northern was to receive one-half of the stock of\r\nthe new company. The new board was to consist of nine directors, of\r\nwhom four were to be nominated by the Northern Pacific Reorganization\r\nCommittee. Each $1000 Northern Pacific second mortgage bond was to\r\nreceive a $1125 new Northern Pacific guaranteed bond; each $1000 third\r\nmortgage bond a new $1000 3 per cent guaranteed bond, and at least $250\r\nin shares; each $1000 5 per cent consol at least $500 in new 3 per cent\r\nguaranteed bonds and $300 in shares. Overdue coupons of the second\r\nmortgage were to be paid in cash at the rate of 5 per cent annually,\r\nthose of the third mortgage at 4 per cent, and those of the consols to\r\nbe adjusted at the rate of 2½ per cent in new 3 per cent bonds. The\r\nfloating debt of the receivership was to be paid by an assessment of\r\nabout $11,000,000 on the old stock. The reorganization and the raising\r\nof the necessary working capital were to be secured by a syndicate\r\nheaded by J. P. Morgan & Company and the Deutsche Bank.[615]\r\n\r\nBriefly stated, this plan proposed to decrease somewhat the funded\r\ndebt, while reducing also the interest rate from 6 and 5 to 4 and 3\r\nper cent. The reduction in fixed charges which would have ensued it\r\nis impossible to estimate without further details. The amount which\r\nbondholders were asked to give up was, however, considerable, and for\r\nthis compensation was variously given in new bonds and in new stock.\r\nThe floating debt was not to be funded, but was to be paid off by\r\nthe commendable method of an assessment; and provision was made for\r\nworking capital, although at what cost in profits to the syndicate\r\nwas not stated. But more important than the details of the plan was\r\nthe guarantee of the new issues by the Great Northern Company for\r\nwhich it provided. The question of consolidation between the Northern\r\nPacific and the Great Northern was said, on what purported to be good\r\nauthority, to have originated on the side of the Northern Pacific among\r\nmen to whom an alliance seemed necessary to the prosperity of the\r\nlatter road.[616] Mr. Hill was said to have been at first reluctant,\r\nand to have consented only on condition that a majority of the Northern\r\nPacific stock should be placed within his hands. It can scarcely be\r\nsupposed, however, that he did not welcome such a union; and the\r\npetition of the Northern Pacific receivers for the cancellation of\r\ncontracts with the Great Northern and the Minneapolis Union railway\r\ncompanies[617] made consolidation especially desirable at this time.\r\nTo the end of this consolidation the Adams Committee plan was chiefly\r\nframed, and on its execution the adequacy of the plan depended. If\r\nthe Great Northern could have been induced to guarantee the principal\r\nand interest of the new Northern Pacific bonds the likelihood of a\r\ndefault would have been reduced to a minimum, even on the indebtedness\r\noutstanding before the receivership; and a scheme for paying the\r\nfloating debt and for providing a certain amount of new capital would\r\nhave been all that would have been required. But it is clear that a\r\nproposal for a consolidation of two of the principal lines serving the\r\nNorthwest brought the consuming and producing public to an interest in\r\nthe Northern Pacific reorganization which they had not felt before.\r\nSo long as a reorganization plan dealt merely with exchanges and\r\nmanipulation of securities by and among securityholders, the influence\r\nof any settlement on outsiders was very indirect; but when it operated\r\nto reduce competition in a large section of the country the effect\r\nwas plain and striking. Certain conservative financiers suggested a\r\nholding company to hold the Great Northern and Northern Pacific stock,\r\nin order to throw some sort of a veil over the proceedings, but Mr.\r\nHill would not consent.[618] Late in August, 1895, therefore, a bill in\r\nequity was filed to prevent the proposed coöperation, and on September\r\n17 Attorney-General Childs, for the state of Minnesota, brought suit\r\nfor an injunction on the ground that the combination was contrary to\r\nthe laws of the state and would prevent competition. It was said that\r\nMr. Childs was supported by the practically unanimous sentiment of the\r\npeople of Washington and Montana. The matter came before the Supreme\r\nCourt on suit by one Pearsall, a stockholder of the Great Northern, and\r\nthis tribunal held that the combination was contrary to the laws of\r\nMinnesota and should, therefore, be enjoined, affirming the principle\r\nfor which Mr. Childs contended.[619] This settled the fate of the Adams\r\nreorganization plan; and an entirely new scheme had to be devised.\r\n\r\nBut while once more progress toward reorganization seemed to have\r\nceased, sensational developments occurred in the factional conflicts\r\nto which we have already referred. To Mr. Ives, barred from all\r\nparticipation in the management of the road, denied a salary, and\r\nunable to obtain the removal of the receivers by Judge Jenkins, came\r\nthe idea of appealing to another court. It will be remembered that, the\r\noriginal receivership suit had been instituted in the circuit court of\r\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin, and that that court ever since had been regarded\r\nas possessing primary jurisdiction. Since no compulsion existed on\r\nother courts to recognize this jurisdiction of the Milwaukee court, the\r\norders of which were supreme in its own district only, and the smooth\r\nworking of the receivership was due to a respect for “comity,” it was\r\npossible, as Ives well knew, for any circuit court along the line to\r\nthrow existing arrangements into the direst confusion. Relying on this\r\nfact, President Ives sent the General Counsel of the company to present\r\napplications for the removal of the receivers to one court after the\r\nother along the road.[620] In September, 1895, judges willing to take\r\njurisdiction were found in Seattle, in the far northwestern corner of\r\nthe United States.[621] Petition was made in two parts: first, that the\r\nSeattle court take jurisdiction; second, that it remove Messrs. Oakes,\r\nRouse, and Payne. Judge Hanford of the Federal Court of the Washington\r\nDistrict called Judge Gilbert of the United States Circuit Court to\r\nsit with him, and deciding on the question of jurisdiction first,\r\naccording to the request of the receivers, the two judges held that the\r\nprinciple of comity did not of necessity apply in the Northern Pacific\r\ncase because no part of the railroad was within the jurisdiction of\r\nJudge Jenkins’s court, and any court along the road could more properly\r\nand efficiently administer the trust. The court, therefore, directed\r\nthe receivers to answer the charges of malfeasance, and to file their\r\nanswers in Seattle by October 2; also to file their accounts with\r\nthe clerk of the court at Seattle,[622] and to file each a $100,000\r\nbond.[623]\r\n\r\nThe result was the prompt resignation of the receivers, who in a letter\r\nto Judge Jenkins made their feelings clear. “Your receivers manifestly\r\ncannot administer the trust,” said they, “with justice to the parties\r\ninterested, or themselves, if subject to the orders and instructions\r\nas to the general administration from two or more independent\r\ntribunals. We cannot abide, nor can we ask our sureties to abide, the\r\ndanger of the differences of opinion between courts, each assuming\r\nto be controlling as to the expenditures of the receivership in the\r\ngeneral administration, in view of the immensity of the interests\r\ninvolved.... Unless your receivers recognize, as they understand it,\r\nthat that honorable court [the Seattle court] is the court of primary\r\njurisdiction they will of necessity be in contumacy.... Your receivers\r\nare not willing under any circumstances to file an additional bond\r\nin such jurisdiction, nor are they willing to put themselves in a\r\nposition to endanger their right to challenge the jurisdiction of that\r\nhonorable court.”[624] Judge Jenkins accepted the resignations and\r\nappointed Messrs. McHenry, chief engineer of the Northern Pacific, and\r\nBigelow, a Milwaukee banker, receivers.[625] The hitherto respected\r\nprinciple of comity had, however, lost all force. On September 30\r\nJudge Sanborn at St. Paul confirmed Judge Jenkins’s appointments for\r\nthe states of Minnesota and North Dakota; on October 1 Judge Hanford\r\nat Tacoma refused to accept the resignation of the old receivers,\r\nbut removed them and appointed Andrew F. Burleigh for the district\r\nof Washington; on October 2 Judge Billinger concurred in Burleigh’s\r\nappointment for Oregon; on October 7 Judge Knowles at Helena, Montana,\r\nconfirmed the above for the districts of Washington and Oregon, and\r\nappointed Captain J. H. Mills and E. L. Bonner for the district of\r\nMontana; and in the week ending October 26 Judge Beatty appointed\r\nBurleigh receiver for Idaho. The only conservative action was that of\r\nJudge Lacombe in New York, who deferred his appointments as often as\r\nthe matter came before him, in the hope that the Western judges would\r\ncome to an agreement.\r\n\r\nThe situation at the end of October, 1895, was as follows: in\r\nWisconsin, Minnesota, and North Dakota there were two receivers,\r\nMessrs. McHenry and Bigelow; in Montana there were three receivers,\r\nMessrs. Mills, Bonner, and Burleigh; and in Idaho, Washington, and\r\nOregon there was one receiver, Andrew F. Burleigh. It was a condition\r\nof affairs which could not be endured. In each of the Western States\r\norders were made compelling all agents or persons connected with the\r\nroad to deposit all money collected in that state, and it was at any\r\ntime in the power of the receivers in any state to appoint operating\r\nofficers distinct from those managing traffic over the other parts of\r\nthe line. On January 9, 1896, Judge Gilbert simplified the situation\r\nby retiring Messrs. Mills and Bonner, and by appointing Andrew F.\r\nBurleigh sole receiver for the district of Montana. This reduced the\r\nnumber of receivers to three, and left Burleigh in control of the\r\nroad west of North Dakota, and McHenry and Bigelow in control of the\r\nrest. Application was now made to the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates, and on January 28, 1896, four justices of this tribunal,\r\nacting as justices assigned to the several districts in which the\r\nNorthern Pacific Railroad Company had property,[626] decided that\r\nJudge Jenkins’s court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin should\r\nbe considered the court of primary jurisdiction, and issued each an\r\norder to this effect to take effect in his particular circuit.[627]\r\nThe various circuit judges hastened to conform. On February 21 Judge\r\nLacombe confirmed the appointment of F. G. Bigelow and E. H. McHenry\r\nas receivers for the Second Judicial District, and similar action had\r\nby then been taken by the judges of the other districts except that of\r\nthe state of Washington. There Judges Gilbert and Hanford refused to\r\ndischarge Burleigh, although recognizing that the general orders for\r\nthe management and control of the railroad property were henceforth to\r\nissue from Judge Jenkins’s court.[628] The judicial strife was thus at\r\nan end. President Ives obtained the removal of the receivers to whom\r\nhe particularly objected, but did not overthrow the authority of the\r\nMilwaukee court, nor secure any material gain to compensate for the\r\ngreat trouble which he caused.\r\n\r\nWith the receivership tangle straightened out it became possible to\r\nproceed again with the work of reorganization, and on March 16, 1896,\r\nthe final plan was published, endorsed not only by the Adams Committee,\r\nbut by President Ives and his Stockholders’ Protective Committee, and\r\nby other important interests as well. The feeling had become general\r\nthat some action should speedily be taken, and that it was in the\r\ninterest of all parties that the factional conflicts which had raged\r\nso long and with so little result should cease. Reorganization was\r\nproposed on the following basis:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The abandonment of Chicago as the eastern terminus, and the\r\nlimitation of the railway on the east by the Mississippi River and the\r\nGreat Lakes;—the bonds and stocks of the Chicago & Northern Pacific\r\nand of the Chicago & Calumet Companies to be sold.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The ultimate union of the main line, branches, and terminal\r\nproperties through direct ownership by a single company.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The reduction of the fixed annual charges to less than the\r\nminimum earnings under probable conditions.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Ample provision for additional capital as required in a series\r\nof years for the development of the property and for the greater\r\nfacilities necessitated by an increased business.\r\n\r\nThere were to be issued:\r\n\r\n$130,000,000 in prior lien 100-year 4 per cent gold bonds, to be\r\nsecured by a mortgage upon the main line, branches, terminals, land\r\ngrant, equipment, and other property embraced in the reorganization ...\r\nand ... thereafter acquired.[629]\r\n\r\n$190,000,000 in general lien 150-year 3 per cent gold bonds, with a\r\nlien junior to the previous issue, but covering the same property, of\r\nwhich $130,000,000 were to be reserved to retire the $130,000,000 prior\r\nlien bonds when they should fall due.\r\n\r\n$70,000,000 in 4 per cent non-cumulative preferred stock.\r\n\r\n$80,000,000 in common stock.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the new prior liens were to go for old first and\r\nsecond mortgage bonds, receivers, certificates, equipment trusts,\r\ncollateral trust notes, St. Paul & Northern Pacific bonds, and for\r\nnew construction; the new general liens for mortgages junior to the\r\nsecond mortgage; the new preferred stock as additional inducement to\r\nthe exchanges mentioned above, and in part for the retirement of old\r\npreferred stock; and the common stock for old preferred stock (in\r\npart) and common stock. Existing first mortgage bondholders were not,\r\nhowever, to be forced to give up their old securities. “It is not\r\nsought in any way to enforce a conversion of the present general first\r\nmortgage bonds,” said the plan, “and this offer is made solely on the\r\nbelief that on the terms proposed such conversion, while advantageous\r\nto the company, is also manifestly to the advantage of the bondholders\r\nso converting.” There were reserved $4,000,000 of the general liens\r\nfor new construction, and $2,500,000 new preferred and an equal amount\r\nof common were set aside under the general head “to provide for\r\nreorganization purposes or available as a treasury asset.” None of the\r\nnew bonds were to be subject to drawing or to compulsory redemption\r\nprior to their regular maturity. The proceeds from land sales to an\r\namount not exceeding $500,000 in any year were to be devoted to the\r\nredemption by purchase and cancellation of the new bonds, purchases\r\nto be made of prior liens so long as these could be secured at not\r\nover 110, after which to continue of the securities next in rank. The\r\npreferred stock was to have a claim for 4 per cent before anything\r\nshould be paid on the common stock, and was to participate equally\r\nwith the common after 4 per cent had been paid on each. There was to\r\nbe a voting trust until November 1, 1901, unless closed out earlier by\r\nthe voting trustees, after the expiration of which the preferred stock\r\nwas to have the right to elect a majority of the board of directors\r\nwhenever for two successive years 4 per cent dividends on their\r\nholdings should not have been paid. No additional mortgage was to be\r\nput upon the property, and the amount of preferred stock was not to\r\nbe increased, except, in each instance, after obtaining the consent\r\nof a majority of the whole amount of the preferred stock, given at a\r\nmeeting of the stockholders called for that purpose, and the consent\r\nof a majority of such common stock as should be represented at such\r\nmeeting, the holders of each class of stock voting separately. During\r\nthe existence of the voting trust the consent of holders of like\r\namounts of the respective classes of beneficial certificates was to\r\nbe necessary. There was to be an assessment of $10 on preferred stock\r\nand of $15 on common. Branch lines were to be consolidated with the\r\nmain line, but each case was to be dealt with separately, and a fair\r\nbasis of adjustment arrived at, for which general lien 3 per cents and\r\nnew preferred stock were reserved. There was to be an underwriting\r\nsyndicate, formed by J. P. Morgan & Company, and the Deutsche Bank of\r\nBerlin, to the subscribed amount of $45,000,000, to provide amounts\r\nof cash estimated to be necessary to carry out the terms of the plan,\r\nand to furnish the new company with some $5,000,000 working capital\r\nfor early use in betterments and enlargements of its property. The\r\nsyndicate’s compensation was not stated in the plan, but was to be\r\n“reasonable,” and in addition to it the sum of ¼ per cent of the par\r\nvalue of all securities deposited was to be paid to J. P. Morgan &\r\nCompany and the Deutsche Bank for their respective services as managers\r\nand depositaries. Finally, at the discretion of the managers, the\r\nvarious properties were to be sold under one of the several mortgages\r\nin default, and a successor company was to be organized.[630]\r\n\r\nAn examination of this plan shows that the total capitalization\r\nproposed, exclusive of bonds and stock reserved for new construction,\r\netc., amounted to $311,000,000; of which $161,000,000 were 4 per\r\ncent and 3 per cent bonds and $150,000,000 stock. The reported\r\ncapitalization of the Northern Pacific Railroad in 1893 had been\r\n$218,685,631, including the bonds of branch roads guaranteed; but\r\ncomparison of this figure with that given by the plan is not fair,\r\nbecause in 1893 the Northern Pacific property had been owned by\r\nfifty-four distinct corporations, which the reorganization proposed to\r\nconsolidate into one. A comparison of the total bonds and stock issued\r\nby the fifty-four corporations with the issue under the reorganization\r\nplan reveals an increase from $271,949,044 to $311,000,000, or 14.3 per\r\ncent. At the same time fixed charges were to be decreased, according\r\nto estimates, from $10,509,690 to $6,052,660; to cover which the\r\nmanagers reported net earnings of $6,015,846 for the year ending June\r\n30, 1895, and of $7,801,645 for the average of the five years ending\r\nwith that date. It will be observed, therefore, that the plan left\r\nno margin between net earnings in 1895 and fixed charges, but relied\r\nupon an increase in earnings for the future to preserve the solvency\r\nof the road. It is, however, only just to say that the net earnings\r\nin 1895 were less than they had been in any year since 1887, with the\r\nexception of 1894, and that a considerable increase was probable.\r\nThe large reduction in fixed charges which was to take place was to\r\nbe chiefly at the expense of holders of the consolidated mortgage\r\nbonds of 1889. These unfortunate investors received but 129 per cent\r\nin new securities, of which nearly one-half was stock, in return for\r\na reduction in their fixed annual income from 5 to 2 per cent, the\r\nreason being the inferior character of their mortgage lien. That\r\nsecurityholders who had consented to exchange their prior securities\r\nin 1889 for the consols then issued in the hope of benefiting the road\r\nshould have fared considerably worse than bondholders who had refused\r\nto make concessions is an example of the injustice sometimes occasioned\r\nby successive reorganizations and refundings. Of the other securities\r\nthe second mortgage received prior liens and stock sufficient to bring\r\nits return over 6 per cent, providing the road should earn it, and the\r\nthird mortgage and dividend certificates received general liens and\r\nstock sufficient to yield something over 5 per cent except in very\r\nprosperous times, when their income would be larger. The underlying\r\nprinciple in these cases was the union of a security with a fixed\r\nclaim on earnings with a security with a conditional claim only. The\r\nfirst mortgage received no stock, and so was denied participation in\r\nfuture profits, but in recompense gave up only some .6 per cent in the\r\nannual income received. The collateral trust notes fared nearly as\r\nbadly as the consolidated mortgage, but the northwest equipment stock\r\nwas paid off in cash. In brief, all securities but the equipment stock\r\nyielded something, and the greatest sacrifices were demanded from the\r\njunior securities. On the other hand, the stock was far from escaping\r\nunscathed. On January 2, 1896, the quoted prices were 3½ for common and\r\n12⅝ for preferred. As against this the plan made assessments of $15 on\r\ncommon and $10 on preferred;—sums which could obviously be demanded\r\nonly because of the probable future appreciation of the shares. A point\r\nin favor of the stock was the fact that the reduction in fixed charges\r\nbrought it nearer a dividend; although it must be remembered that\r\nthe common stock had to divide any return above 4 per cent with the\r\npreferred.\r\n\r\nThe other salient points of the plan were the provision for paying the\r\nfloating debt, for supplying fresh capital for future additions and\r\nimprovements, for consolidation of branch lines with the main stem, and\r\nfor a voting trust. The total floating debt in 1895 amounted to over\r\n$20,000,000, of which $4,900,000 consisted of outstanding receivers’\r\ncertificates and $8,329,205 of interest matured and unpaid.[631] The\r\nunpaid interest was provided for in the exchanges which have already\r\nbeen described; the receivers’ certificates were cancelled by prior\r\nlien bonds, and the balance was provided for by assessment. This method\r\nwas a sound one. The provision for new construction, betterments,\r\netc., was liberal, consisting of $25,000,000 prior lien bonds, of\r\nwhich no more than $1,500,000 were to be issued in any year, and\r\n$4,000,000 general lien bonds, presumably to be used as needed. One\r\nof the great difficulties in the history of the company had been the\r\nlack of necessary capital for needed work upon the line, and it was\r\nwell that future requirements were provided for. The consolidation of\r\nthe branch lines into the parent company was also wise. “As it [the\r\nNorthern Pacific system] now stands,” the committee said, “the system,\r\nin its form of incorporation and capitalization, is a development\r\nwithout method or adequate preparation for growth. Scarcely any\r\nsingle security is complete in itself. The main line mortgages cover\r\nneither feeders nor terminals. The terminal mortgages may be bereft\r\nof their main line support. The branch lines are dependent on the\r\nmain line for interchange of business and the main line owes a large\r\npart of its business to the branch lines.”[632] The plan contemplated\r\nseparate bargains with each branch. Negotiations were carried on\r\nduring 1896, and some of the arrangements arrived at were as follows:\r\nThe bondholders of the Northern Pacific & Manitoba Terminal and of\r\nthe James River Valley Railroad agreed to take 50 per cent in new\r\nNorthern Pacific 3 per cent bonds and 50 per cent in preferred stock,\r\nand to allow the Northern Pacific to retain their property.[633]\r\nBondholders of the Duluth & Manitoba were given 90 per cent in\r\ncash.[634] Bondholders of the Spokane & Palouse received 52½ per cent\r\ncash, 52½ per cent in general 3s, and 25 per cent in Northern Pacific\r\npreferred stock,[635] and Helena & Red Mountain bondholders agreed to\r\naccept 100 per cent in new preferred.[636] A number of the branches\r\nwere foreclosed and bought in by the Northern Pacific reorganization\r\ncommittee, and the net result was an exceedingly beneficial unification\r\nof the system. Finally, the voting trust was designed to secure\r\npermanence in policy during the first years of the new company’s\r\nexistence. The idea has been a common, and on the whole a wise one. In\r\nthis case the membership represented fairly the interests which had\r\nbeen prominent throughout the receivership, and consisted of J. P.\r\nMorgan, George Siemans, representing the Deutsche Bank, August Belmont,\r\nJohnston Livingston, and Charles Lanier. The trustees were to fill\r\ntheir own vacancies, except that the successors of George Siemans were\r\nalways to be nominated by the Deutsche Bank.\r\n\r\nIn the main the plan was a good one, following a sound principle,\r\nand reducing fixed charges to a point which, if not far below the\r\ndanger-line, proved low enough in view of the subsequent development in\r\nbusiness. Current opinion was generally favorable, and criticised only\r\nthe amount of profits which the syndicate was to secure on the basis\r\nof its large subscribed capital. Mr. Hill of the Great Northern said:\r\n“I think the Northern Pacific reorganization plan will be successful.\r\nThe promoters have adopted a conservative policy, and have marked the\r\ninterest charges down. We are entirely satisfied to have the Northern\r\nPacific securityholders run the road, pay its debts, and be charged\r\nwith the responsibility of meeting all its proper obligations, rather\r\nthan to have it operated by the officers of two or three courts which\r\nare continually contending as to jurisdiction.”[637] By April 23, when\r\nthe time for deposits expired, the reorganization committee was able to\r\nannounce that it held over 92½ per cent in amount of general, second,\r\nand third mortgage bonds, dividend certificates, consolidated mortgage\r\nbonds, collateral trust notes, preferred stock, common stock, northwest\r\nequipment stock, and Northern Pacific and Montana first mortgage bonds,\r\nand that the plan and agreement was therefore declared operative.[638]\r\nBy June a majority of the first mortgage bonds had been secured, and it\r\nwas announced that after June 30 the basis of conversion of this issue\r\nwould be reduced from 135 to 132 per cent in new 4 per cent prior lien\r\nbonds. On July 24 the Northern Pacific _Railway_ filed its articles of\r\nincorporation at St. Paul, Minnesota, and the next day the sale of the\r\nproperty took place, in spite of suits by the general creditors and the\r\npreferred stockholders. The sale was in three parcels, and the property\r\nwas bid in for $12,500,000 by Mr. Winter, the newly elected president.\r\nAfter the first sale the company’s lands in Wisconsin were offered and\r\nbid in for $575,000, and two days later the lands west of the Missouri\r\nwere bought in for sums aggregating $600,000. Finally, on August 4,\r\nthe lands in Washington and Oregon were bought in for $1,705,200 and\r\n$558,000 respectively. The property of the company was turned over\r\nby the receivers to the reorganization committee at midnight, August\r\n31, and on November 7 the final step in the reorganization plan was\r\ntaken by the formal authorization by the stockholders of the issue of\r\n$190,000,000 of bonds.[639]\r\n\r\nFrom 1896 to the present time the Northern Pacific has enjoyed a\r\ndevelopment scarcely less noteworthy than that of the Union Pacific.\r\nGross earnings have increased from $23,679,718 in 1898, the first\r\nfull year after the receivership, to $68,534,832 in 1907; net revenue\r\nfrom $13,471,544 to $33,208,840; and mileage from 4350 to 5444. Gross\r\nearnings per mile were $5443 in 1898; they were $12,590 in 1907. The\r\nretirement of the eastern terminus of the system from Chicago to\r\nSt. Paul and Minneapolis was accomplished in the course of 1897 by\r\narrangement for connection with the Chicago & Northwestern instead\r\nof with the Wisconsin Central, and the sale of the certificates of\r\nproprietary interest in the Chicago Terminal Transfer Railroad received\r\nby the Northern Pacific under the Chicago & Northern Pacific plan\r\nof reorganization; while the improvement of the position of the new\r\nmortgages has been vigorously prosecuted by the rapid drawing for\r\nredemption of old first mortgage bonds at 110, and by the calling of\r\nthe entire issue of the Missouri division bonds at par and accrued\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nIn the years following 1897 large sums have been spent for betterments\r\nand enlargements. Some $68,500,000 have been invested from the proceeds\r\nof the sale of prior lien bonds and of miscellaneous assets, and\r\nover $18,000,000 have been temporarily withdrawn from income for the\r\nsame purpose.[640] Grades have been reduced, lines straightened, new\r\nbranches built, real estate acquired, track relaid and ballasted,\r\nbridges strengthened and renewed, equipment rebuilt and increased in\r\namount, and other similar betterments undertaken. It is a work which\r\nall the great American systems have carried on, but the Northern\r\nPacific has surpassed even the Union Pacific in the extent of its\r\noperations. Ordinary maintenance requirements have not meanwhile\r\nbeen neglected, and in 1906 and 1907 the Northern Pacific set aside\r\n$2,000,000 for depreciation of equipment, which is over and above\r\nthe other sums which have been mentioned. The company owned 1255\r\nlocomotives on June 30, 1907, of an average weight of 174,000 pounds;\r\nin 1898 it had owned 542 of an average weight of 104,000 pounds. It had\r\n42,000 freight cars in 1907 with an average capacity of over 33 tons;\r\nit had possessed 18,500 in 1898 of an average capacity of 22 tons.\r\nSeventy-five per cent of the main line was laid with track of 72 pounds\r\nor over in 1906, but only thirteen per cent in 1898. In consequence\r\nheavier trains are run,[641] at a less expense per ton, and the net\r\nrevenue is correspondingly increased. Even the liberal expenditures\r\nwhich have hitherto been made are insufficient, however, for present\r\nconditions, and the stockholders have approved a proposal to issue\r\n$93,000,000 of new common stock at par for the purpose of extending the\r\nNorthern Pacific’s mileage and facilities.[642]\r\n\r\nThe endeavor to stimulate traffic to fill the trains has led to\r\nimportant developments. In order to increase the exchange of\r\ncommodities between their territory and the Middle West, to establish\r\nstable conditions on transcontinental business and thereby to secure\r\nback loading for their cars, the Great Northern and Northern Pacific\r\nin 1901 arranged for the purchase of the Burlington system which\r\nconnected both their lines with Chicago. The refusal to share their\r\npurchase with Mr. Harriman led to the competitive purchase of Northern\r\nPacific stock by rival interests, and to the retirement of the Northern\r\nPacific preferred, but did not prevent the consummation of the\r\ndeal.[643] This purchase has been a profitable one. The Burlington has\r\npaid in dividends upon its stock almost enough to cover the interest on\r\nthe bonds issued to acquire it, and the indirect effects of its control\r\nhave satisfied expectations. Indeed, the east-bound lumber traffic has\r\nso developed that the Great Northern has recently raised its lumber\r\nrates in order once more to equalize east- and west-bound shipments.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Pacific has been openly dominated by the Hill-Morgan\r\ninterests for the last six years, and probably has been under their\r\ncontrol since its reorganization. From the financial as well as from\r\nthe traffic point of view its position is secure. The voting trust was\r\ndissolved in 1901 “by reason,” in the words of the trustees, “of the\r\nevidence of financial strength, conservative management, skilful and\r\nprofitable operation, superior physical condition of the property,\r\nand the reasonable prospect of continued prosperity.”[644] In 1907,\r\nout of a net income of $33,208,840 only $9,575,183 were paid out for\r\ninterest, rentals, and taxes, and $23,473,929 were left for dividends,\r\nimprovements, and reserve. This whole sum, which amounts to 33 per cent\r\nof gross income, is available as a protection for the mortgage bonds;\r\nand a considerable portion could be dispensed with without forcing a\r\ndecrease in the present rate of dividends.[645] It is likely that the\r\ncoming years will see a check in the advance of national prosperity,\r\nbut the Northern Pacific is in excellent condition to stand the strain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nROCK ISLAND\r\n\r\n  Charter—Early prosperity—Reorganization of 1880—Conservative\r\n    policy—Extension—Pays dividends throughout the nineties—Moores\r\n    obtain control—Reorganization of 1902—Further extensions—\r\n    Impaired credit of the company.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original Rock Island Railroad, chartered in 1847,[646] was\r\ncompleted between Chicago and Rock Island in 1854. Construction was\r\ncontinued from Rock Island to Council Bluffs across the state of Iowa,\r\nunder the charter of the Mississippi & Missouri, until 1866, when this\r\ncompany was merged with the original Rock Island Railroad Company,\r\nand after 1866 under the Rock Island charter until the extension was\r\ncompleted in 1869. Unlike the Atchison, the Rock Island passed through\r\na fairly well-settled territory, which was at the same time one of the\r\nmost fertile in the United States. In 1870, according to the census\r\nreturns, Iowa produced 28,708,312 bushels of spring wheat out of a\r\ntotal for the United States of 112,549,733 bushels, more than any other\r\nstate in the Union; while Illinois in its yield of winter wheat was\r\nsurpassed by Indiana and Ohio alone. Of Indian corn Iowa and Illinois\r\ntogether produced 198,856,460 bushels against 562,088,089 for all other\r\nstates combined. Manufactures were well begun, and even mining had\r\nattained a considerable development, particularly in the extraction\r\nof bituminous coal in Illinois. Naturally the road was prosperous;\r\ngross earnings increased from $3,154,236 in 1866 to $5,995,226 in\r\n1870, and to $9,409,833 in 1879; while net earnings attained the very\r\nconsiderable sum of $4,548,117 in 1879, being 48 per cent of the gross\r\nreceipts. At the same time the capitalization was very moderate, due to\r\nthe relatively level character of the country through which the road\r\nran, and, not less important, to the absence of speculative financial\r\noperations in the course of its construction. To build 1231 miles had\r\ncost in 1879 but $35,664,200, of which $4,702,202 had been supplied\r\nfrom earnings; leaving a total of bonds and stocks of $30,962,000, or\r\n$25,151 per mile. Fixed charges were, therefore, low. In 1875, when\r\nnet earnings were $3,853,676, interest on bonds, taxes, and all other\r\nnecessary disbursements took but $1,065,395; and in 1879 the payments\r\nwere markedly less. Is it strange that the troubles of the road came\r\nfrom too great earnings rather than from too small, and that instead\r\nof striving to maintain solvency the directors had to seek ways and\r\nmeans for concealing or getting rid of earnings without arousing the\r\nhostility of legislators to whom 10 per cent dividends seemed high, and\r\nanything over 10 per cent proof of extortion? Between 1866 and 1876\r\nfour cash distributions of 10 per cent were made to stockholders, five\r\nof 8 per cent, one of 8½ per cent, and one of 7½ per cent. The dividend\r\nfor 1879 was again 10 per cent, that of 1878 8 per cent, and that for\r\n1879 9½ per cent. Meanwhile large sums were carried to surplus. The\r\nbalance, after all disbursements, never after 1873 fell below $665,000,\r\nand in 1879 was nearly equal to the dividend declared; that is, while\r\ndistributing $1,993,086, or 9.5 per cent, the road earned, over and\r\nabove charges, $3,947,065, or 18.8 per cent.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that some attempt should be made to increase the\r\ndistribution to stockholders; and the most obvious method was the one\r\nadopted, viz., a watering of the stock. The plan devised in 1880 was\r\nas follows: It was proposed to consolidate various branches of the\r\nrailroad company, hitherto operated as separate corporations, with\r\nthe main line; and to do this through the formation of a new company,\r\nwhich should exchange its stock for the stock of the previously\r\nexisting corporations in the ratio of two to one. Practically all\r\nthe stock retired was owned by the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific\r\nRailroad Company, so that the only increase in stock outstanding came\r\nthrough the distribution to the stockholders of the parent company. In\r\nMarch the executive committee of the Rock Island passed the following\r\nresolution: “Resolved, that the proposition to consolidate the capital\r\nstock, property, rights, franchises, and privileges of the Chicago,\r\nRock Island & Pacific Railroad Company with the capital stock,\r\nproperty, rights, franchises, and privileges of the Iowa Southern\r\n& Missouri Northern Railroad Company, the Newton & Monroe Railroad\r\nCompany, the Avoca, Macedonia & Southwestern Railroad Company, and\r\nthe Atlantic & Audubon Railroad Company into a consolidated Railroad\r\nCompany, with an authorized capital of $50,000,000, and such powers as\r\nshall be assumed in the articles of consolidation, be submitted to a\r\nvote of the stockholders of this company at their annual meeting.”[647]\r\nOf the roads named only the Iowa Southern & Missouri Northern was of\r\nimportance, extending 270 miles from Washington, Iowa, to Leavenworth,\r\nwith branches which raised its total to 347 miles. This company had\r\nbeen organized as the Chicago & Southwestern Railroad Company, and\r\nthe main line had been completed in 1871. The Chicago, Rock Island &\r\nPacific Railroad Company had guaranteed its $5,000,000 main-line bonds,\r\nwith a provision that it could demand foreclosure if called upon to\r\npay either interest or principal, and in return had secured a lease in\r\nperpetuity. The road had been sold under foreclosure and reorganized in\r\n1875 as the Iowa Southern & Missouri Northern, and had issued its stock\r\nto the Rock Island in return for money advanced by that company, the\r\nstock to be held in trust to 1926, and then to become the property of\r\nthe lessee. The other roads did not together possess more than 80 miles\r\nof line, so that the operation was a genuine case of stock-watering.\r\nThe opinion of the stockholders may be inferred from the quotations\r\nof their shares. Between January 2 and June 1, 1880, the quotations\r\nof Rock Island common rose from 149 to 189, with few sales, in\r\nanticipation of the distribution. On June 2 the stockholders formally\r\ngave their approval, and on June 4 the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific\r\nRailway started on its career.[648] The price of the new stock was of\r\ncourse less than that of the old. It started at 106½, but by December\r\nit had reached 122¼, and by June the following year had risen to over\r\n141.\r\n\r\nThis may be called Rock Island’s first reorganization. It doubled the\r\nstock of the road, and increased its indebtedness by the assumption\r\nof the $5,000,000 bonds of the Iowa Southern & Missouri Northern; but\r\nthe new stock involved no increase in fixed charges, and the new bonds\r\na nominal increase only. Instead of being occasioned by too little\r\nprosperity it was caused by too much; and instead of being carried\r\nthrough after active opposition from many of the interests concerned,\r\nand reluctant acquiescence from the others, it occasioned a rise in\r\nprice of the common stock of 27 per cent in six months.\r\n\r\nBetween this date and 1902 no reorganization occurred. A rapid review\r\nof the period brings out, however, certain interesting features: First,\r\nthat the stockholders and the directors were extremely conservative;\r\nsecond, that this conservatism did not keep the road from sharing in\r\nthe expansion of mileage from 1887–9, which was so general in the\r\nMiddle West; third, that this expansion decreased the average receipts\r\nper mile, and consequently the rate of dividends, and occasioned a fall\r\nin stock quotations from 140⅞ to 63⅜; fourth, that though weakened\r\nthe road went through the panic of 1893 and the subsequent depression\r\nwithout suspending dividends; and fifth, that the year 1901 saw the\r\nbeginning of a new expansion of the system, accompanied by a change\r\nin control and the carrying out of more ambitious plans than had ever\r\noccurred to the men of the previous generation.\r\n\r\nThe conservatism of the stockholders is shown in the election, year\r\nafter year, of the same men to positions of authority. Rock Island\r\nwas not a speculative road; the high price of its stock forbade.\r\nStockholders regarded their shares as permanent investments, and,\r\nsatisfied with the returns secured, loyally supported the management\r\nin good times and in bad. Between 1875 and 1897 there were but two\r\npresidents, Mr. Riddle holding the position until 1883, and then giving\r\nway to Mr. R. R. Cable, who, after directing the policy of the company\r\nfor fourteen years, served as chairman of the board of directors from\r\n1898 to 1901. Among the five members of the executive committee, if the\r\nreckoning is begun with the year 1881, three had been in office five\r\nyears by 1886, one 2 years, and one 1 year, or an average of 3⅗ years.\r\nIn 1891 two members had been in 10 years, one 7 years, one 6 years,\r\nand one 1 year, or an average of 6⅘ years; and in 1901 one member had\r\nbeen in 20 years, one 17 years, one 8 years, one 3 years, and one 2\r\nyears, or an average of 10 years. The board of directors showed the\r\nsame general tendency. In 1890 seven of the thirteen directors had\r\nserved for 9 years, and the average service was 6-3/13 years; in\r\n1897 four of the directors had served for 16 years, and the average\r\nwas 9-10/13.[649] It was but natural that men working under these\r\nconditions should have been apt to err on the side of caution rather\r\nthan on the side of recklessness; and we find them, therefore, slow\r\nto extend their system, and slow to stretch into new territory where\r\ntraffic returns were uncertain, and where the road had to create its\r\nbusiness as it went. At the date of the consolidation the company had\r\nbecome the owner of 1038 miles and operated under lease 273 miles more,\r\nor a total of 1311 miles. By 1883 this had been increased to 1381; but\r\nin 1887 the total was only 1384.2, showing a total construction of\r\nlittle over three miles in four years.\r\n\r\nThis policy had to be abandoned, for other roads were extending their\r\nlines in Iowa and Illinois, and the Rock Island’s share of Western\r\nbusiness tended to fall off with the construction of rival lines\r\nwest of the Missouri. As the report of 1889 expressed it, “while the\r\nlines of this company terminated at the Missouri its competitors for\r\nbusiness had extended beyond, reaching in many cases the extreme\r\nwestern boundaries of population and even further. Thus the volume\r\nof traffic received by the company for carriage to and from the West\r\nwas materially affected, while in order to restore the equilibrium\r\noverbalanced by the reduction in rates, the reverse was necessary,\r\na larger rather than a smaller share of the tonnage to and from\r\npoints west of the Missouri was demanded by the situation.” The\r\ndirectors were forced against their will to take active measures\r\nin self-protection. As early as 1884 a bond issue was approved for\r\nconstruction from Minneapolis westward to an eventual junction with the\r\nNorthern Pacific.[650] Building was to be carried on in the name of the\r\nWisconsin, Minnesota & Pacific Railroad Company, and the securities\r\nof this company were to be received by the Rock Island as collateral\r\nfor the issue which it made.[651] Two years later more extensive plans\r\nwere put on foot, and the Chicago, Kansas & Nebraska Railroad Company\r\nwas organized to carry out construction west of the Missouri. The\r\nnew company had a capital stock of $15,000,000, and then (1887) of\r\n$30,000,000, and an indebtedness in 1889 of $25,141,000 6 per cent\r\nfirst mortgage bonds; and turned over all of its bonds, and practically\r\nall of its stock to the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway in\r\nconsideration of advances made to it. The Rock Island Company in its\r\nturn reserved the branch-line bonds as collateral, and issued against\r\nthem its own 5 per cent collateral and extension bonds; agreeing to\r\nsupply all money needed for construction and equipment,[652] and\r\nleasing the new railway at a rental of 30 per cent of its gross\r\nearnings.[653] Under this arrangement 1388 miles were built by 1889\r\nand 276 leased, making a total of 1664.4. In 1889 it was thought more\r\nconvenient to consolidate the two systems, so interest was defaulted\r\non the Chicago, Kansas & Nebraska bonds, and foreclosure proceedings\r\ncommenced; resulting in 1891, in spite of protests by municipalities\r\nalong the route, in a foreclosure sale and union of the two properties\r\nin name as well as in fact. The collateral bonds of the Chicago, Rock\r\nIsland & Pacific now became a direct instead of an indirect lien upon\r\nthe Kansas & Nebraska mileage.[654]\r\n\r\nOwing to these operations the mileage of the system increased from\r\n1384 in 1887 to 3257 in 1889, and to 3408 in 1891. The greater part\r\nnow lay in Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado instead of in Illinois and\r\nIowa, while at the same time the addition of the new mileage through\r\nsparsely settled districts decreased the density of traffic and the\r\ngross and net receipts per mile of line. In 1887 the Rock Island was\r\nearning the very high return of $8899 gross per mile operated; in 1891\r\nthis had fallen to $5126; in 1887 the net return was $3478 per mile; in\r\n1891 it had fallen to $1484; in other words, the new mileage brought\r\nan increase in traffic, but not nearly so great a traffic per mile as\r\nthe Iowa and Illinois lines had enjoyed, while the financing of the new\r\nconstruction swelled the annual charges from $1,795,351 to $4,775,601,\r\nand even with the larger mileage increased the charges per mile from\r\n$1295 in 1887 to $1400 in 1891. We need not, therefore, be surprised\r\nthat the rate of dividends dropped from 7 per cent to 5¾ per cent and\r\nthen to 4 per cent; nor that the price of common stock fell from its\r\nhigh level of 140⅞ in May, 1887, to 63⅜ in March, 1891.\r\n\r\nIt was in this weakened condition that the Rock Island encountered the\r\npanic of 1893 and the years of depression which followed, and yet,\r\nin spite of the marked decrease in business in the years 1895–6–7, it\r\ncontinued to pay dividends, and showed no signs of financial distress\r\nexcept the lowering of its rate to 2 per cent. As a matter of fact\r\nthe road was still in these years one of the strongest in the United\r\nStates. Its lines were well located, its management was conservative,\r\nand consequently trusted, and its credit was good; so that at a time\r\nwhen some of the largest systems in the United States were being forced\r\nto the wall, it was enabled to preserve its solvency and even to keep\r\nup fairly liberal expenditures for maintenance of way and rolling\r\nstock. Little new construction was of course indulged in. In 1892 an\r\nextension was begun from Minco, the terminus of the Rock Island in the\r\nnorthwest corner of the Indian Territory, southwards;[655] in 1893\r\nthe southern boundary of the Territory was reached, and the Chicago,\r\nRock Island & Texas Railway Company was organized to build through\r\nTexas;[656] and in 1894 a combined line was opened to Fort Worth;\r\nbut exclusive of the Chicago, Rock Island & Texas, the total mileage\r\nincreased by but 360 miles between 1890 and 1900, being an average of\r\n33 miles a year.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 Messrs. William H. Moore and D. G. Reid were elected directors\r\nin place of Messrs. H. M. Flagler and H. A. Parker, and a new era\r\nin the road’s affairs began. Mr. Moore had not long been interested\r\nin railroad matters. Known as a daring and successful promoter of\r\nindustrial companies, he had made large profits out of the organization\r\nof the National Biscuit and Diamond Match companies; had lost almost\r\nequally large amounts in speculation which had followed, and had then\r\nregained a fortune through the organization and promotion of companies\r\nwhich were absorbed into the United Steel Corporation. In these last\r\noperations he had come into contact with Mr. W. B. Leeds, who, though\r\noriginally a railroad man, had acquired wealth through a tin-plate\r\nplant which was afterwards turned over to this same Steel Corporation.\r\nMr. Moore was apparently in 1901 seeking for an investment. He was too\r\nwell acquainted with industrial properties to care to sink his money\r\nin them, while he realized that for obvious reasons good railroad\r\nproperty was as safe, and might be made as profitable as anything else\r\nto which he could turn. The Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific was at the\r\ntime the system most available for his purpose. It was not under the\r\ncontrol of any large New York interests; it had an excellent financial\r\nrecord; its mileage was so placed as to admit of ready expansion; and,\r\nmoreover, it is probable that to a man of Mr. Moore’s speculative\r\ndisposition the very low capitalization of the road opened up vistas of\r\nalmost indefinite increase.[657] Just when Mr. Moore and his friends\r\nbegan their purchases, and what price they paid is of course largely a\r\nmatter of conjecture: large blocks of stock were, however, undoubtedly\r\nsecured in the early months of 1901, during which time quotations\r\nranged from 116⅞ to 136; and it is probable that the larger part of\r\nthe purchases were made nearer the upper than the lower level. During\r\nthe following year the Moore party increased their holdings. It has\r\nbeen said that in April, 1901, Messrs. Moore and Reid were elected\r\nto the directorate. In November, 1901, at a special meeting of the\r\nstockholders, the directors were authorized to elect two new members\r\nto the executive committee, and Messrs. Moore and Wm. B. Leeds were\r\nchosen. In February, 1902, H. R. Bishop, Tracey Dows, and F. E. Griggs\r\nresigned, and Geo. McMurtry, F. L. Hine, and F. S. Wheeler were elected\r\ndirectors in their place. Mr. McMurtry had formerly been president of\r\nthe American Sheet Steel Company, merged in the Moore Steel Combine,\r\nand Mr. Hines, vice-president of the First National Bank of New York,\r\npresumably brought the backing of that powerful institution.[658]\r\nMeanwhile Mr. James H. Moore had been chosen a director, and the Moore\r\ninterest had gained control of the executive committee, so that a\r\nmajority both of that committee and of the board of directors was\r\nin their hands. The new group of capitalists were not railroad men;\r\ntheir training had been on the financial side of corporation dealings,\r\nand the bulk of what experience they had had in actual management had\r\nbeen derived from industrial and not from railroad operations. It was\r\nnatural, therefore, that the most striking results from their accession\r\nto power should appear on the financial rather than on the operating\r\nend, and that their ability to manipulate stocks and bonds should prove\r\nmore unquestionable than their ability to handle railroad affairs.\r\nResults in the development of the Rock Island system were, however,\r\nattained, and for two reasons: in the first place, the Moores were\r\nable, and above all enterprising men, and untrammelled by traditions\r\nof conservatism, they were quick to see and bold to execute plans made\r\npossible by the admirable location of their 4000 miles of road; in\r\nthe second place, they soon had large blocks of securities which they\r\nwished to sell, and were impelled to undertake large operations in the\r\nhope of raising quotations upon the Exchange.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1901, the stockholders authorized an increase in the capital\r\nstock from $50,000,000 to $60,000,000; stockholders of record June 28,\r\n1901, to have the right to subscribe at par.[659] The proceeds were\r\nto go in part for extension from Liberal, Kansas, to El Paso, Texas,\r\nand in part for a new depot and elevation of tracks in Chicago, and\r\nfor the improvement of the physical condition of the road. This El\r\nPaso extension plan was not new, since in December, 1900, the Chicago,\r\nRock Island & Mexico, and the Chicago, Rock Island & El Paso had been\r\nincorporated to build a line from Liberal, Kansas, to Santa Rosa, New\r\nMexico; there to connect with the El Paso & Northeastern, and to afford\r\na through route to the Pacific coast and into Mexico. The other plans\r\nwere, however, new. In April, 1903, the Chicago, Rock Island & Texas\r\nfiled an amendment to its charter providing for an extension from Fort\r\nWorth to Galveston, 295 miles. The same month the sale of the Choctaw,\r\nOklahoma & Gulf to the Rock Island was officially confirmed. This\r\nroad has been, with one exception, the most important acquisition of\r\nthe Moores. It stretches from Memphis, Tennessee, through the Indian\r\nTerritory, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, to the border line of Texas, and\r\nfurnishes a nearly direct line from those states to the Mississippi\r\nRiver; while a projected extension to New Mexico will connect with\r\nthe Rock Island main lines to the southward, and make it a valuable\r\nlink in the through route from El Paso to Memphis and Birmingham. The\r\nRock Island paid $80 a share for the common stock and $60 for the\r\npreferred,[660] and under the terms of the sale agreed to take at the\r\nsame price all stock offered. The premium was very large. Choctaw\r\npreferred had been paying 5 per cent for some years, and the common had\r\nreceived 2 per cent in 1889, 4 per cent in 1900, and 4½ per cent in\r\n1901, plus 10 per cent in stock; but reckoned on a basis of 120 and 160\r\nrespectively, these returns sank to a very modest rate. The property\r\nis a valuable one, but will have to show great development to justify\r\nits purchase price. Payment was made by the issue of collateral trust\r\n4 per cent bonds to the amount of $23,520,000, in return for which\r\npractically all of both issues of stock were deposited. Certain smaller\r\nroads were also bought in. In June, 1902, the stockholders voted to\r\nincrease the capital stock from $60,000,000 to $75,000,000; and in July\r\nthe directors decided to allow the stockholders to subscribe at par for\r\n$8,235,000 of the new issue in amounts equal to 12½ per cent of their\r\nholdings;—the new stock to take up shares of the Burlington, Cedar\r\nRapids & Northern, the Rock Island & Peoria, and the St. Louis, Kansas\r\nCity & Colorado.[661] The first of these roads connected the Rock\r\nIsland system with Minneapolis and St. Paul.[662] The Rock Island &\r\nPeoria was a short line in the state of Illinois. The St. Louis, Kansas\r\nCity & Colorado was to afford, when finished, a more direct route\r\nbetween the important cities of St. Louis and Kansas City.\r\n\r\nThis is where matters stood when the reorganization plan of August,\r\n1902, was brought forward. There had been a refunding put through\r\nin 1897 whereby some simplification of bond issues had been\r\nsecured;[663] but this scheme of 1902 was for a different purpose and\r\ndiffered radically in the methods employed. Its explanation is to\r\nbe found in the character of the men in control. We have seen that\r\nMr. Moore had made his reputation in the speculative promotion of\r\nindustrial combinations, that he had entered Rock Island in search of\r\nan investment, and that he had thrown himself into the extension of\r\nthe system in part because he saw the opportunity for development,\r\nin part because he hoped to pave the way for profitable manipulation\r\nof the stock. The time he had awaited seemed now to have arrived.\r\nHis projects had caught public attention, comment on the whole had\r\nbeen favorable, and the price of his shares was at a high level;\r\nall indications pointed to the probable success of a scheme of\r\nstock-watering on an enormous scale. At the same time Mr. Moore was too\r\nwell pleased with the position he had attained to wish to sacrifice\r\nit by the sale of his holdings; and his desire was, therefore, to\r\ndevise an arrangement whereby the stock of the Rock Island should be\r\ninflated and large blocks sold to the confiding public, while the\r\ncontrol should remain where it had been before,—in the hands of Mr.\r\nMoore and his followers. It is to be noticed that there was no call\r\nfor a reorganization by the creditors of the road, and no question\r\nof a default in interest, or even of a cessation of dividends upon\r\nthe common stock; nor, on the other hand, were earnings so great that\r\nthe managers felt it unwise to distribute them. The reason for the\r\nreorganization was entirely the financial ambition of the Moore group\r\nand the chance which its members saw of making larger profits than the\r\nearnings of the property would ever bring.\r\n\r\nWith these objects the following plan was put through. Instead of one\r\nChicago, Rock Island & Pacific Company the Moores now proposed to have\r\nthree companies, of which one was to operate the railroad, one was to\r\nhold the stock of the operating company, and one was to hold the stock\r\nof the company which held the stock of the operating company. That is\r\nto say, the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company was left\r\nundisturbed, while in Iowa a Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad\r\nCompany was formed to hold the stock of the Railway Company, and in New\r\nJersey a Rock Island Company was organized to hold the stock of the\r\nRailroad Company, and of such acquisitions as might afterwards be made.\r\nThe retention of the Railway Company made unnecessary the consent of\r\ncreditors, for the lien and interest rate of outstanding bonds remained\r\nthe same as before; the formation of the Railroad Company served\r\napparently to meet legal requirements; and the organization of the Rock\r\nIsland Company seemed likely to make more easy the purchase of parallel\r\nand competing lines. But the great advantage of the new companies lay\r\nin the opportunities for stock inflation which they presented, together\r\nwith the lessening of the amount of capital required for control.\r\nThis appears plainly in the following: The old Railway Company had a\r\ncapital stock of $75,000,000; the new Railroad Company issued stock\r\nto the amount of $125,000,000 and 4 per cent bonds to the amount of\r\n$75,000,000. The Rock Island Company issued common stock to a total\r\nof $96,000,000 and preferred stock to a total of $54,000,000; and the\r\naggregate, excluding the undisturbed bonds of the Railway Company,\r\nfooted up to $425,000,000 instead of to $75,000,000 as before. From\r\nthis total must be deducted $200,000,000, which represented issues of\r\nstock by one company to another, and $21,000,000 Rock Island Company\r\nstock and $1,500,000 Railroad Company bonds reserved for future\r\nextension, leaving a net increase from $75,000,000 to $202,500,000.\r\nThis involved some increase in fixed charges, since 4 per cent on\r\n$75,000,000 became obligatory; but the true significance lay in the\r\ninflation of principal rather than in the increase of interest charges,\r\nopening as it did an opportunity for great profit to the managers\r\nin the sale of the new securities. An incidental result was the\r\ntransformation of the Rock Island shares from investment securities to\r\nmedia for speculation. At the same time the investment required for\r\ncontrol was diminished. $75,000,000 of Railway stock was exchanged for\r\n$75,000,000 Railroad bonds, $96,000,000 Rock Island Company common\r\nstock, and $54,000,000 Rock Island Company preferred stock. Of these\r\nthe bonds obviously had no voting rights. To both the common and\r\npreferred stock the right to vote was given, but in unequal degrees.\r\n“Until the number thereof shall be increased,” read the certificate of\r\nincorporation of the Rock Island Company, “the number of directors\r\nshall be nine. There shall be five classes of directors. The first\r\nclass shall contain a majority of the whole number of the directors as\r\nfixed at any time by the by-laws.... The holders of the preferred stock\r\nshall have the right, to the exclusion of the holders of the common\r\nstock, to choose directors of the first class....” In other words, to\r\nthe preferred stock, which constituted a minority of the whole, was\r\ngiven the right to elect a majority of the board of directors; so that\r\nwhereas in the old Railway Company 51 per cent of $75,000,000 common\r\nstock, selling at from 120 to 179, had been required for control, in\r\nthe new combination of companies 51 per cent of $54,000,000 Rock Island\r\nCompany preferred stock, selling at 83½, was sufficient to the same\r\nend, in spite of a doubling of the stock outstanding.\r\n\r\nTo repeat: Two new corporations were formed, of which the Chicago,\r\nRock Island & Pacific Railroad Company of Iowa issued $125,000,000\r\nstock to the Rock Island Company of New Jersey, and in return received\r\n$127,500,000 Rock Island preferred and common stock. With this stock,\r\nand with $75,000,000 of its own bonds, the Railroad Company purchased\r\nthe $75,000,000 stock of the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway\r\nCompany, paying for every $100 in shares\r\n\r\n  $100 in Rock Island Company common stock;\r\n    70 in Rock Island Company preferred stock; and\r\n   100 in its own 4 per cent bonds.\r\n\r\nThe Railway shares acquired were pledged for the Railroad bonds, and\r\nfrom them came the total income of the Railroad Company; and dividends\r\nupon the Railroad shares, together with dividends upon shares of other\r\ncompanies which it might chance to own, constituted the total income of\r\nthe Rock Island Company. After thus receiving indirectly the earnings\r\nof the Railway Company through two sets of dividends, the Rock Island\r\nCompany paid dividends on its own shares, which were held by the\r\npublic; the preferred stock being entitled to 4 per cent from 1903 to\r\n1909 inclusive, to 5 per cent from 1910 to 1916 inclusive, and to 6 per\r\ncent thereafter.\r\n\r\nOther provisions were as follows: The Rock Island common stock might\r\nbe increased from time to time according to law, but the amount of the\r\npreferred stock could not be increased except with the assent of the\r\nholders of two-thirds of the entire preferred stock and two-thirds of\r\nthe entire common stock at the time outstanding, given at a meeting\r\ncalled for that purpose. Preferred stock was to be preferred as to\r\nprincipal as well as to interest; it had the right, as has been said,\r\nto elect a majority of the board of directors, but this right could\r\nbe surrendered by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds\r\nin amount of the preferred stock at the time outstanding at a special\r\nmeeting of the holders of the preferred stock called for that purpose.\r\nA Finance Committee might be appointed from and by the directors which\r\nshould have such powers as the directors and stockholders should choose\r\nto give it, and which should have all the powers of the directors when\r\nthe board was not in session. The directors might accumulate working\r\ncapital, but no reservation for working capital should be made in\r\nany year out of the surplus or net profits of such year until after\r\nthe payments for such year of the dividends on the preferred stock\r\nof the company. The directors might also use the working capital in\r\npurchasing or acquiring the shares of the capital stock of the company\r\nas they might deem expedient, but shares so purchased might be resold\r\nunless retired for the purpose of decreasing the capital stock of the\r\ncompany.[664] This last provision aroused so much criticism that the\r\ndirectors gave up the right of dealing in the shares of their own\r\ncompany by resolution of November 5, 1902.\r\n\r\nThe important features of this reorganization were, as has been\r\nindicated, those in connection with the inflation of the capitalization\r\nand with the control of the property. In this connection it may be\r\nasked, first, whether the Moores made a profit by the deal; second, how\r\nlarge an investment they have had to keep in the property in order to\r\nretain control; and third, what cost to them this investment represents.\r\n\r\nOn January 2, 1902, Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company\r\ncommon was quoted at 154. On February 1 it was 162¼, on April 1, 179,\r\non July 1, 172½, on August 1, 190, on October 1, 200, and on November\r\n1, 199½. It is safe to assume that the rise from 172½ to 200 was due\r\nto the publication of the plan, and it may be that some of the earlier\r\nincrease in value was owing to purchases by insiders, or by people\r\nwho had obtained some inkling of what was being considered; but a\r\ncomparison of the aggregate value of the securities given for the\r\nrailway common stock on January 3, 1903, with the price of the stock\r\non July 1, 1902, shows that the former exceeded the latter by 22.3\r\npoints, with the error tending toward an understatement of the excess.\r\nThat is, for every $172½ invested in July, 1902, the Moores, and other\r\nstockholders with them, held securities worth $194.8 in January of\r\nthe following year. During 1903 the Rock Island securities fell with\r\nothers upon the market, till on January 2, 1904, the aggregate value of\r\nthe stocks and bonds in question was only $132.2; but the decline was\r\ntemporary, and by January 3, 1905, recovery to $176.6 had taken place.\r\nThe operations therefore did result in a chance for large profits, and\r\ngave renewed evidence that the public demand for stocks and bonds does\r\nnot fall off proportionately to an increase in their volume.[665]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that neither before nor after the reorganization could\r\nthe Moores have sold all their holdings and yet have kept control.\r\nStarting again with the price of 172½ for Chicago, Rock Island &\r\nPacific Railway common on July 1, 1902, it may be calculated that\r\nthe cost of a majority of the issue then footed up to $64,687,672.\r\nIf this had been carried on margin, and the brokers had demanded on\r\nevery share a deposit of $40, with $40 more instantly available if\r\nneeded, the total investment required for control would have been\r\n$15,000,040, with as much more held in readiness for any emergency. On\r\nJanuary 2, 1903, Rock Island preferred stock was selling at 83½, and\r\nthe cost of a majority of the whole issue would have been $22,545,083;\r\nwhich, if carried on margin with a deposit of $20 a share, would have\r\nrepresented an investment of $5,400,020, with as much more in reserve.\r\nIn other words, while all went well, less than $11,000,000 sufficed\r\nto control properties with a total mileage of 7718 miles of line,\r\na bonded indebtedness of $201,660,475, and an outstanding capital\r\nstock of $118,249,007. It is of course improbable that the Moores in\r\n1903 carried all, or even a large part of their holdings on margin;\r\nsupposing, therefore, that all of their stock was bought and paid for,\r\nthe fact still remains that with $22,545,083 they were able to control\r\na system capitalized at $319,909,482.\r\n\r\nIn examining the cost to the Moores it is at once to be said that these\r\ngentlemen did not pay 172½ for their old Railway stock. What they did\r\npay is of course uncertain. It is known that much of their holdings\r\nwas acquired in the early months of 1901, when prices ranged from 116⅞\r\nto 136. An average of 140 would represent a conservative estimate of\r\nwhat they paid, at which price a majority of the $75,000,000 would have\r\ncost $52,500,140. In return for this stock, at the prices of January 2,\r\n1903, they obtained\r\n\r\n  $18,375,049 in Rock Island Company common stock,\r\n   21,918,808 in Rock Island Company preferred stock, and\r\n   32,765,712 in Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad Company\r\n     4 percent bonds.\r\n\r\nSince the preferred stock sufficed for control, there were left\r\n$18,375,049 of Rock Island Company common, and $32,765,712 of Railroad\r\nCompany bonds, or a total of securities with a nominal market value of\r\n$51,140,761. Deducting this from the original investment, which has\r\nbeen estimated at $52,500,140, there is left $1,359,379 to represent\r\nthe actual cost to the Moore crowd of control of the great Rock Island\r\nproperty. Beneath all of these figures lies, of course, the erroneous\r\nassumption that it would have been possible to unload large blocks\r\nof securities upon the market without causing a break in price; and\r\nyet, though large deductions must be made on this account, the figures\r\nare eloquent of the skill with which the Moores have manipulated Rock\r\nIsland issues, and of the slender basis on which their control rests.\r\nIt has been truly said that the question is raised anew as to what is\r\nlegitimate in corporate finance.\r\n\r\nAll this is very different from anything described before; and so far\r\nas motives go, the two Rock Island reorganizations stand by themselves.\r\nIn the matter of methods some similarities appear. The great increase\r\nin capitalization resting on the Rock Island system was accomplished\r\nmainly by an inflation of stock, not of mortgage bonds, and involved a\r\ncomparatively slight increase in fixed charges; the Rock Island Company\r\nclosely resembled other holding companies in its method of operation,\r\nand seemed likely to offer some facilities for the consolidation of\r\ncompeting lines; and though the extraordinary privileges given the\r\nRock Island preferred stock have perhaps never been paralleled in\r\ndegree, the practice of granting such stock preferential treatment in\r\nother things than dividends is not unknown. On the whole, however,\r\nthis kind of reorganization stands apart, and is rather instructive as\r\nshowing what may be done in the handling of corporation securities than\r\nin indicating any sound principles on which bankrupt roads may proceed.\r\n\r\nThe reorganization plan aroused sharp criticism both from Wall\r\nStreet[666] and from the wider public, but met no opposition sufficient\r\nto prevent its being carried through. In September Attorney-General\r\nC. W. Mullen, of Iowa, in an opinion filed with the Governor of that\r\nstate, held that the acts of the new Iowa corporation of the Rock\r\nIsland, _i. e._ the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad Company,\r\nwere not outside the powers conferred by statute.[667] The Governor,\r\nin concurring with the opinion from a legal point of view, added, “the\r\nthing done is neither a merger nor a consolidation. Not a mile of track\r\nnor a dollar in value is added to the Rock Island property. It is\r\nsimply a new device for watering securities; it is for the next General\r\nAssembly to say whether it is wise to permit our laws to so remain\r\nthat such things are possible.”[668] The various corporations were,\r\ntherefore, organized, and the various issues of stocks and bonds put\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nDuring the past four years the events which require mention are four:\r\nFirst, the acquisition of the St. Louis & San Francisco; second, the\r\nconnection of the Rock Island with the Gulf; third, the temporary\r\ncontrol of the Chicago & Alton; and fourth, the issue of a new\r\nrefunding mortgage.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1903, the Rock Island operated 7123 miles of line. Its\r\ntracks stretched southwest from Chicago to Santa Rosa, New Mexico,\r\nwest from Memphis to Tucumcari, and northwest from Rock Island,\r\nIllinois, to Minneapolis and St. Paul, and to Watertown, South Dakota.\r\nThis extensive mileage surrounded, however, instead of occupying, a\r\nlarge territory in Missouri, Kansas, Indian Territory, and Arkansas,\r\nand could claim no share in the vast traffic passing up and down the\r\nMississippi Valley. One of the first acts of the Moores was to remedy\r\nthis defect. In May, 1903, the Rock Island made a formal offer to\r\npurchase any and all shares of the St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad\r\nCompany, providing $22,500,000 in par value should accept, at a rate\r\nof $60 par value in the common stock of the Rock Island Company and\r\n$60 par value in a new issue of 5 per cent gold bonds of 1913 of the\r\nChicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad Company, for each $100 par\r\nvalue of Frisco common stock deposited; the new bonds to be secured by\r\nthe stock acquired. This Frisco Company, it will be remembered, was the\r\nsame that had previously been acquired and given up by the Atchison,\r\nTopeka & Santa Fe. Since that time it had greatly extended its mileage,\r\nhad gained control of the prosperous Chicago & Eastern Illinois, with\r\nentrance into Chicago, and was altogether more valuable than it had\r\nbeen before. In relation to the Rock Island it possessed precisely\r\nthe mileage which was required. It connected the latter’s terminus at\r\nChicago with the terminus of the Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf at Memphis;\r\nit traversed Southern Illinois, Southern Missouri, Southeastern\r\nKansas, and Indian Territory, to say nothing of lines in Oklahoma and\r\nin Texas; and by means of a line from Memphis to Birmingham it gave\r\nentrance into the heart of the South. In brief, it filled the gaps in\r\nthe southeastern part of the Rock Island system, and afforded a solid\r\nfoundation for further expansion. Good authorities consider the price\r\nwhich the Rock Island gave for the Frisco to have been too high. It is\r\ncertain that the Frisco stockholders jumped at the chance. By June 1,\r\n1903, the necessary $22,500,000 worth of stock had given their consent\r\nand only technical details remained to be carried through.[669]\r\n\r\nWith the St. Louis & San Francisco under its control the Rock Island\r\ncould make a final advance to the Gulf. An attempt to complete a road\r\nthrough Texas occurred simultaneously with the Frisco purchase in\r\n1903. The Moores, that is, arranged with the Southern Pacific for the\r\npurchase of a half-interest in the Houston & Texas Central, from Fort\r\nWorth to Houston and Galveston, with a branch to Austin, Texas; the\r\nHouston, East & West Texas, extending north from Houston to Shreveport,\r\nLouisiana; and the Texas & New Orleans, from Dallas to Sabine Lake\r\non the Gulf of Mexico. As a part of the agreement the presidents of\r\nthese lines were to be selected by the Rock Island Company.[670] This\r\nwould have established a line to the coast in a very satisfactory\r\nmanner. Connection between Dallas and Fort Worth was to be completed\r\nin December, 1903, and from this point the two lines of the Houston\r\n& Texas Central and the Texas & New Orleans would have furnished\r\ndirect outlets to the Gulf. The scheme did not go through, because\r\nthe Texas Railroad Commissioners pronounced the contracts contrary to\r\nthe state constitution, in that they amounted to a consolidation of\r\nthe corporations concerned, and to the establishment of a community\r\nof interest between the Rock Island and the Southern Pacific, which\r\nwould preclude competition between them in respect to their Texas\r\nbusiness.[671] The Rock Island was at first disposed to test part of\r\nthe decision in the courts.[672] It later decided that discretion was\r\nthe better part of valor, stopped the transaction, and cancelled the\r\nstock which it had issued as part of the purchase price.[673]\r\n\r\nWhat the company could not do in Texas it could do, however, in\r\nMissouri, Louisiana, and Arkansas. As early as November, 1902, the St.\r\nLouis & San Francisco had purchased the entire capital stock of the\r\nSt. Louis, Memphis & Southeastern Railroad, a line which was opened\r\nfrom St. Louis in 1904 to a junction with a branch of the Frisco above\r\nMemphis. From Memphis the Kansas City, Memphis & Birmingham stretched\r\nsoutheast through Mississippi into Alabama. These roads formed a basis\r\nfor extension which was practicable though less convenient than the\r\nwestern route. Accordingly, in 1904, trackage agreements were concluded\r\nwhich gave to the Rock Island system:\r\n\r\n(1) Trackage rights over the Mobile & Ohio and the New Orleans &\r\nNortheastern between Tupelo, Mississippi (on the Kansas City, Memphis &\r\nBirmingham), and New Orleans, Louisiana.\r\n\r\n(2) Trackage rights over the St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern and\r\nthe Texas & Pacific from a point opposite Memphis, Tennessee, to a\r\npoint opposite Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\r\n\r\n(3) Trackage rights over the Yazoo & Mississippi Valley between Baton\r\nRouge, Louisiana, and New Orleans, Louisiana, and over certain tracks\r\nin the latter city.\r\n\r\nThis afforded alternative routes of considerable directness from\r\nMemphis to the Gulf, while from the junctions of the Frisco with the\r\nSouthern roads freight could be sent north to St. Louis and Chicago\r\nover the Rock Island system’s own rails. Arrangements were made for the\r\nconstruction of terminals in New Orleans by a subsidiary company whose\r\nstock was to be owned and whose bonds were to be guaranteed by the\r\nSouthern and the St. Louis & San Francisco companies.[674]\r\n\r\nAt the present time the Rock Island is reaching south at two points\r\nother than those so far mentioned. Under the name of the Rock Island,\r\nArkansas & Louisiana Railroad Company,[675] it has built almost due\r\nsouth from Little Rock, Arkansas, while from New Orleans to Houston\r\nit has completed a line which connects at Eunice, Louisiana, with the\r\nRock Island, Arkansas & Louisiana, and at Houston with the Trinity &\r\nBrazos Valley Railway.[676] This last line runs from Houston to Fort\r\nWorth and Dallas, Texas, and is controlled by a half-interest in its\r\ncapital stock. The Rock Island is thus in fair shape to share in the\r\nsouth-bound grain movement from Kansas, Nebraska, and the Dakotas,\r\nand to take a part in the north and south business of the Mississippi\r\nValley. There is no question but what the company is making a bold\r\nbid for an enormous traffic, and that failure will not be due to any\r\nnarrowness of view.\r\n\r\nAbout the time that it was struggling to reach the Gulf the Rock\r\nIsland took hold of the Chicago & Alton in the north in order to have\r\nanother and a more direct line between Kansas City and Chicago. A\r\nstrong minority interest had previously been bought in the Alton by\r\nMr. Harriman, and a board of directors had been elected. In 1904 the\r\nRock Island bought within a few hundred shares of absolute control,\r\nand since the classification of the board prevented the displacement\r\nof its opponents for two years, arranged a compromise. Between them\r\nthe Harriman and the Rock Island interests deposited a controlling\r\nnumber of Alton shares with the Central Trust Company of New York, to\r\nbe held in a voting trust. Each of the rival interests was to have five\r\ndirectors, and the odd director was to be in alternate years first a\r\nHarriman and then a Rock Island man.[677] The Rock Island was, further,\r\nto have an option on the Harriman holdings for two years. It was an\r\nunfortunate time to buy. Mr. Harriman had previously displayed his\r\nsplendid dividend producing ability in Alton finance, and the road was\r\nshort of money. Market conditions were unfavorable, bonds were hard\r\nto sell, and, after all, the Alton was not of vital importance to the\r\nRock Island, although it opened up new territory of some considerable\r\nimportance. By 1907 it seems that the Moores had become tired of\r\ntheir bargain. In June of that year they served notice on the Union\r\nPacific that the compromise agreement of 1904 was illegal and should\r\nbe abrogated;[678] and shortly after they sold their holdings to the\r\nToledo, St. Louis & Western.[679]\r\n\r\nAll in all the growth of the Rock Island has been astounding. Instead\r\nof the limited number of 7123 miles which the system possessed in 1903,\r\nor the 3819 of 1901, it comprises 14,270 miles of line operated in\r\n1907. Gross earnings are $112,464,000 in 1907 as against $25,365,000\r\nin 1901; net income $40,828,000 instead of $8,901,000; capitalization\r\nabout $525,000,000 instead of $118,081,000. In fact, the very size\r\nof the system and the diverse nature of its interests make the\r\neconomical management of the whole almost beyond the capacity of any\r\none man. The Rock Island handles traffic from the West and South to\r\nChicago, St. Louis, and Birmingham, and connects with the trunk lines\r\nto the Atlantic coast; it is also striving to receive and care for\r\nthe constantly increasing business from the Northwest to the Gulf.\r\nIt reaches into Mexico; it extends into Colorado, and sends branches\r\ninto the Northwest; while at the other end it connects Kansas City,\r\nMemphis, and St. Louis by a triangle of lines. It was remarked a year\r\nago that a contrast between the operations of the Rock Island and of\r\nthe Atchison lines in the Southwest disclosed what might be called\r\ndemoralization on the part of the former, and it is in the multiplicity\r\nof its operations that the cause must be sought.\r\n\r\nIt is to be expected, therefore, that the financial position of the\r\ncompany should not be secure. Operating expenses, fixed charges, and\r\ntaxes absorbed 87 per cent of gross income in 1907 and 89 per cent the\r\nyear before. We must not be blinded by the magnitude of the reported\r\nfigures. Although $9,476,397 were carried to surplus in the year ending\r\nJune 30, 1907, and $5,568,092 were paid out in dividends, these two\r\nitems together comprise only about 13 per cent of gross income, and a\r\nbad year might readily see a decrease sufficient to sweep this margin\r\naway. Unlike the Union Pacific and the Northern Pacific, moreover, the\r\nRock Island has not made consistently heavy improvement expenditures\r\nfrom income. Less than $40,000 was deducted by either the Frisco or\r\nthe Rock Island & Pacific Railway in 1905 or in 1907; less than half a\r\nmillion in 1904; a little over two millions in 1903 and in 1906. And\r\nthis in spite of the fact that the mileage of the Rock Island system\r\nis greater than that of any other road which this study has taken up.\r\nThe fate of the company’s refunding mortgage of 1904 probably testified\r\nas much to the distrust of the Moore group of financiers and of the\r\nsoundness of the property which they control as it did to the general\r\nfinancial uneasiness of the time. This proposition for a refunding\r\nmortgage was first framed in July, 1903. It then comprised an issue\r\nof $250,000,000 4 per cent bonds, to be used for the refunding of\r\noutstanding obligations, future enlargements and construction, purchase\r\nof bonds and stocks of other companies, and for the reimbursing of the\r\ncompany for advances already made. Subscriptions were sought in New\r\nYork in vain. Whereas the project was to have come up at a meeting of\r\nthe stockholders on October 8, the managers obtained an adjournment\r\nof this meeting until January without action, and before that month\r\narrived announced an indefinite postponement of operations. On March\r\n21 the stockholders voted on and approved a modified version of the\r\noriginal scheme, whereby $163,000,000 instead of $250,000,000 were\r\nauthorized, of which $15,000,000 were to be issued at once, and\r\n$82,025,000 were to be reserved for retiring certain outstanding\r\nobligations. It proved no easier to secure subscriptions to this than\r\nto the previous plan, and in April $5,000,000 4½ per cent notes were\r\nissued instead and taken by the First National Bank of New York, which\r\nwas already closely identified with the company. Not until November,\r\n1904, after fourteen and one-half months of persistent effort, was a\r\nfirm of bankers found to take the refunding issue. $25,108,000 were\r\nthen sold to Speyer & Co. Mr. Speyer became a director of the Rock\r\nIsland and entered the finance committee, while the proceeds of the\r\nsale went to reimburse the treasury for capital expended, and to\r\nprovide for the payment of obligations maturing in 1905. Since this\r\ntime other blocks of the bonds have been sold.\r\n\r\nIt is thus evident that the Rock Island has not regained the position\r\nwhich it held prior to the operations of Mr. Moore and of his friends.\r\nThe recent developments have done two things: they have piled upon\r\nthe company a mass of excessive capitalization; and they have\r\ntransformed it from a moderate sized railroad with a clearly defined\r\nflow of traffic into a great system sprawled over the Central West\r\nand handling at least three different currents of business. Neither\r\none of these changes alone can account for the present condition of\r\nthe road. Together they have made it what it is. It is only fair to\r\nsay that large sums from capital account are being spent upon the\r\nproperty and that the managers announce an intention of bringing it\r\nup to the highest standard of physical condition. Over $4,000,000\r\nwere appropriated for additions and improvements in 1907, and nearly\r\n$3,500,000 in 1906, besides still greater sums for construction and\r\nequipment. Heavier rails have been laid down, bridges have been\r\nstrengthened, equipment increased and improved. Meanwhile maintenance\r\ncharges have not been unduly low, though not so high as on some other\r\nWestern roads. It is true, nevertheless, that the Rock Island has lost\r\nits former stability and must await a period of lessened earnings with\r\nserious apprehension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n  Definition of railroad reorganization—Causes of the financial\r\n    difficulties of railroads—Unrestricted capitalization and\r\n    unrestricted competition—Problem of cash requirements—Problem of\r\n    fixed charges—Distribution of losses—Capitalization before and\r\n    after—Value of securities before and after—Provision for future\r\n    capital requirements—Voting trusts—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nA general survey of railroad reorganizations may now be attempted.\r\nEighteen different ones and no less than forty-two reorganization plans\r\nhave been examined in detail. In their seemingly infinite variety\r\nmay not some guiding principles be found which will assist both in\r\ninterpreting the past and in directing the future?[680]\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that a readjustment of a railroad’s affairs is more\r\ndifficult than the readjustment of those of an individual. A railroad\r\nis a complex financial, as well as a complex operating machine.\r\nEspecially when it has been built up by the union of numerous small\r\nproperties, each of which has been allowed to retain a certain\r\nindividuality of its own, are the relations between the different\r\nparts intricate and involved. The obligations which have been incurred\r\nin the course of its career, and the kinds of paper which represent\r\nthese obligations, disclose a variety which the debts of an individual\r\nseldom or never present. This complexity in railroad capitalization\r\ninevitably leads to clashes in interest between different classes of\r\nsecurityholders. Divergencies in interest seem to appear even while a\r\nroad is solvent. If classes of securities exist upon which payment of\r\ninterest is optional, it is to the advantage of the junior issues to\r\nprevent payment of interest or dividends upon others until earnings\r\nare such that payment may be made upon all. If common stockholders\r\ncan reinvest in the property sums which normally would be paid in\r\ndividends on the preferred stock, they advance the day upon which\r\nthey can secure dividends for themselves at the expense of their\r\nseniors. The same situation may also arise as between the preferred\r\nstock and the income bonds. Or, again, it may be to the advantage of\r\nspeculative stockholders to pay dividends to themselves by means of the\r\naccumulation of a floating debt, and to sell out at top quotations,\r\nleaving the floating debt to take precedence even of mortgage\r\nbonds.[681] Both this and the preceding operation are facilitated\r\nby the control which the least valuable portion of the capital, the\r\ncommon stock, usually has over the policy of the entire company. But\r\nit is when a reorganization becomes necessary that these conflicts\r\nin interest become most apparent, and it is as a compromise between\r\ncontending forces that a reorganization plan must take its shape.\r\n\r\nThe term “reorganization” is used in this study to denote the exchange\r\nof new securities for the principal of outstanding, unmatured, general\r\nmortgage bonds, or for at least 50 per cent of the unmatured junior\r\nmortgages of any company, or for the whole of the capital stock. These\r\nexchanges have been the essential features of the operations which\r\nhave been described. This exchange of securities must take place upon\r\na considerable scale. Small readjustments may involve valuations of\r\nspecific bits of property, but they do not require that comprehensive\r\nsurvey of the relations of all parts of the system to each other\r\nwhich distinguishes the general reorganization. In fact, the small\r\nadjustments are at once more simple and more difficult than the larger\r\nkind. More simple because they involve less change; more difficult\r\nbecause the same pressure cannot often be brought to bear. It is useful\r\nto mark a dividing-line between the small and the large. No such\r\nline can be defended as exact; but the one chosen seems to include a\r\ntolerably homogeneous group, and will lend a convenient definiteness to\r\nthe discussion.\r\n\r\nAs thus defined, a reorganization may be, and generally is, accompanied\r\nby other operations essential to its success. If a large floating debt\r\nhas been accumulated, provision for the cancellation of this debt must\r\nbe made;[682] if unprofitable leases have been entered into, these\r\nmust be abolished;[683] or if the system has been unduly hampered by\r\ninability to issue new capital, appropriate relief must be afforded.\r\nBut none of these are determining features. They are means to an end,\r\nas is the exchange of new securities for old, and they may have their\r\neffect just as the economical management of the Union Pacific under\r\nCharles Francis Adams had its effect in the years prior to 1890; but\r\nthey are not essential parts of that group of operations which have\r\nbeen characterized as reorganizations.\r\n\r\nThe exchange of new securities for old on a large scale usually takes\r\nplace when a railroad is unable to meet maturing obligations. Of 18\r\nreorganizations and 42 plans, 15 reorganizations and 39 plans have had\r\nto do with the extrication of companies from financial embarrassment.\r\nBut though impending insolvency is the usual occasion it is not the\r\nonly one. Reorganization sometimes occurs when prosperity is too great\r\nas well as when it is too little. Or a management may desire to get\r\nrid of hampering restrictions, or it may desire to manipulate the\r\nconditions of control. This last named cause—the desire to manipulate\r\nconditions of control—has been fortunately an infrequent cause of\r\nreorganization. An example is, however, afforded by the Rock Island\r\nreorganization of 1902. It will be remembered that the Chicago, Rock\r\nIsland & Pacific Railway had long been a prosperous road in the Middle\r\nWest, and that its control had required the ownership of between 40\r\nand 50 per cent of $75,000,000 of common stock, quoted at over 160\r\nin the early part of 1902. By the issue of new bonds, new preferred\r\nand new common stock to a total of $270 for every $100 of old common\r\nstock, and by giving to the preferred stockholders the right to elect\r\na majority of the directors, the owners of the property were able to\r\npart with a large portion of their holdings and yet retain absolute\r\ncontrol. A somewhat similar case was that of the Chicago & Alton. This\r\nroad had been a conservatively capitalized enterprise, doing a large\r\nbusiness between Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City. It had paid 7\r\nper cent or better on its two classes of stock for eighteen years\r\nwithout a break, and had accumulated in that time an uncapitalized\r\nconstruction expenditure of $12,444,178. In 1899 a syndicate of Eastern\r\ncapitalists bought control, and the following year reorganized the\r\nproperty by forming a holding company, which issued $22,000,000 in 3½\r\nper cent bonds, $19,489,000 in preferred and $19,542,800 in common\r\nstock to exchange for the $22,230,600 old common and preferred shares\r\noutstanding. At current prices on January 3, 1899, a majority of\r\nboth the old issues would have cost $19,030,048; on January 4, 1901,\r\nhowever, a majority of both of the new issues represented an investment\r\nof $10,729,437; and this investment it would have been possible to\r\nreduce to $2,241,377 by the sale of the new bonds received, without in\r\nany way endangering control.[684]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that both the Rock Island and the Chicago & Alton\r\nreorganizations were influenced by the very great prosperity of the\r\ncompanies concerned. It was desired to reap a profit by the sale\r\nof new securities as well as to lessen the investment required for\r\ncontrol; although it may be remarked that the advantage of retaining\r\ncontrol depended on the future prosperity of the roads. Reorganizations\r\nconcerned with manipulation of control are therefore closely allied\r\nwith reorganizations due to too great prosperity. These latter may,\r\nhowever, take place independently, and are likely to occur whenever\r\nprofits are extraordinarily large, and a simple stock dividend is\r\ndeemed inadvisable. An example was the reorganization of the Chicago,\r\nRock Island & Pacific in 1880, when the formation of a new company and\r\nthe exchange of new stock for old was deemed wise, in view of the large\r\nearnings which were to be distributed.\r\n\r\nThe desire to eliminate hampering restrictions is seldom the sole\r\ncause for a reorganization, but frequently it is a contributing one.\r\nWhen, for instance, the managers of the Union Pacific wished to\r\nextend their system in the years following 1880, they were forced\r\nto establish a separate organization for each branch line. By the\r\nterms of the charter nothing could be consolidated with the main stem\r\nexcept the Kansas Pacific and the Denver Pacific, the consolidation\r\nwith which was provided for in the original acts.[685] This obviously\r\nprevented considerable economies, and could be remedied only by a\r\nnew incorporation. The Northern Pacific was hampered in yet another\r\nway because the consent of three-fourths of the preferred stock was\r\nrequired by the terms of the reorganization of 1875 to the imposition\r\nof new mortgages;[686] and similarly the Atchison, after 1889, found\r\nit extremely difficult to issue new bonds because of the position of\r\nthe outstanding income bonds. In this last case the restriction was the\r\nsole cause of the reorganization which followed. It should be remarked\r\nthat the cancellation of such provisions sometimes works considerable\r\ninjustice. Restrictions on future increases in capital, for instance,\r\nmay have facilitated the issue of bonds in the past, and in this case\r\nhave formed part of the consideration given for subscriptions. The\r\nreadjustment is defended on the ground of the need of the corporation,\r\nor is so accomplished as not to lessen the value of the creditors’\r\nholdings.[687]\r\n\r\nThe typical railroad reorganization, as has been said, occurs when a\r\nroad ceases to be able to pay interest on its outstanding obligations.\r\nWhether because of excessive capitalization or because of unexpectedly\r\nlow earnings, or owing to an accumulation of floating debt which ties\r\nup all current resources, the reorganizing railroad finds itself\r\nincapable of meeting payments falling due. For this, experience shows\r\nthat two deep-seated causes have generally been responsible. First,\r\nthere is the almost entire freedom in matters of capitalization which\r\nrailroads have enjoyed. Far from the recommendation of Secretary Taft\r\nthat no railroad company engaged in interstate commerce be permitted\r\nto issue stock or bonds and put them on sale in the market except\r\nafter a certificate by the Interstate Commerce Commission that the\r\nsecurities are issued with the approval of the Commission for a\r\nlegitimate railroad purpose,[688] American railroads have in the past\r\nbeen practically unrestricted. It was open to the Erie to increase\r\nits capitalization per mile from $81,068 in 1864 to $117,760 in 1872,\r\nwith no corresponding addition to its property; it was open to the\r\nUnion Pacific to create a capitalization of $104,561 per mile by 1870,\r\nof which about one-quarter was in the form of government bonds; and\r\nit was possible for the Atchison to issue $129,162,350 in new bonds\r\nand stocks between 1884 and 1889 while its net earnings seriously\r\ndecreased. Had there been a supervision of new issues, or had even a\r\ncertain percentage of stocks to bonds in those instances been required,\r\nfailures would have been less frequent and reorganizations less common.\r\nNew construction would probably have been less rapid, but not so much\r\nso as is often asserted. A smaller number of new enterprises might have\r\nyielded larger profits; the chances for land speculation might have\r\ntempted many, and liberal regulations might have allowed a generous\r\nprofit while at the same time eliminating all inflation due to fraud.\r\nUnfortunately railroad-hungry communities seldom stopped to count\r\nthe cost. West, South, North, and East, privileges were offered to\r\nrailroads, donations of land and money were made, and exemptions from\r\ntaxation were conferred.\r\n\r\nThe second fundamental cause of railroad distress has been competition.\r\nIf unrestricted capitalization has increased the load which the\r\nrailroads have had to bear, unrestricted competition has impaired their\r\nability to support any load at all. The forms which this competition\r\nhas taken have been mainly two: first, the cutting of rates, either\r\nopenly or by secret concessions; second, reckless extensions of line,\r\ngenerally followed by rate-cutting. The cutting of railroad rates\r\nis now a subject familiar to all. Illustrations may be found in the\r\nhistory of any great railroad system. President Hadley has made\r\nclassical the theory that roads will take business until rates fall\r\nbelow the specific cost of hauling a given shipment; that is, below\r\nthe additional cost which the articles in question impose. Even this\r\nlimitation is often non-existent. Railroads which serve different\r\ncities will take freight when a war is in progress whether or not the\r\nrate repays the specific cost of hauling. If their rival imitates\r\nthem they hope to wear it out by their superior ability to stand the\r\nloss. If it does not, the city which they serve will temporarily eject\r\nall others from common market, and may obtain so firm a footing that\r\na permanent increase in business will result. All of the railroads\r\nwhich have been studied, in fact, have suffered more or less from\r\nrate-cutting. Repeated attempts at pooling and agreements to maintain\r\nrates have improved conditions only during the short periods in which\r\nthe agreements have been of effect. In the South there have been\r\nscarcely more successful attempts to secure harmony by community\r\nof stock control. Competition by means of extensions has been also\r\nvigorously practised. The reader will recall the growth of the Atchison\r\nfrom 1884 to 1889. It was after the dissolution of the Southern Railway\r\nSecurity Company that the East Tennessee entered upon its policy of\r\npurchase and of new construction. The entrance of the Reading into New\r\nEngland was the direct cause of its failure in 1893; and that of the\r\nBaltimore & Ohio into New York largely contributed to its difficulties\r\nin 1887. Sometimes such extension is into territory where there is no\r\nbusiness to justify it. Sometimes the business is there, but has to be\r\ndivided among too many rivals. Sometimes the new lines are so poorly\r\nbuilt as to be unduly expensive to work, and not infrequently they\r\nare so good that the resources of the expanding road are strained in\r\nacquiring them. In any one of these four cases new extension causes a\r\ndrain upon the parent road which may readily bring about its failure.\r\n\r\nOther conditions may lead to railroad failure. Simon Sterne alleges the\r\nfollowing causes to be often responsible:[689]\r\n\r\n1. The control of railroads by stock which represents little or no\r\noriginal cash investment.\r\n\r\n2. The development of the territory served by individual railroads at\r\na slower rate than is anticipated, and the influence of competition in\r\nreducing profits when the territory has developed.\r\n\r\n3. The undertaking of railway construction when there is considerable\r\nactivity in the money market, and when capital commands a high rate of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n4. The circumstance that railways, lacking reserve capital, can never\r\navail themselves of a cheap market for labor or supplies, but must\r\nalways buy when everything is inflated, because then only can they\r\nfloat their loans and borrow capital.\r\n\r\n5. The necessity of complete reconstruction within a brief period of\r\nmost railroads built through new territory, and the increase in funded\r\nand in floating debt involved.\r\n\r\n7. The growth of railroads beyond the ability to handle them.\r\n\r\n8. The steadily increasing expenditures required by law to accommodate\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\n9. The abuse of their position by directors and trustees.\r\n\r\n10. The irresponsibility of railway accounts.\r\n\r\nAnd it may be added that the control of American railways by foreign\r\ninvestors who apportion charges between operating and capital accounts\r\nin a way unsuited to American conditions has been upon occasion a\r\ncause of disaster. Unlimited freedom in matters of capitalization and\r\nunrestricted competition have nevertheless been the fundamental causes\r\nof bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe that the majority of the principal\r\nrailroads which failed in the nineties had taxed their resources nearly\r\nto the point of exhaustion before the panic of 1893 finally drove them\r\nto the wall. For every $100 received in 1892 the Richmond & Danville\r\nand East Tennessee systems were paying out $68.79 for operating\r\nexpenses and $31.15 for interest on bonds, rentals, etc., leaving only\r\n6 cents for dividends, necessary improvements, and the like. For every\r\n$100 received the Erie paid out the same year $66.46 for operating\r\nexpenses and $31.85 for interest and other fixed charges, leaving only\r\n$1.68 as a surplus to ensure solvency in case of a decline in earnings.\r\nIn 1893 the Atchison, the Northern Pacific, the Reading, and the Union\r\nPacific had no surplus at all, but rather a deficit. The following\r\ntable shows similar figures for all of our reorganized roads:\r\n\r\n                          _Percentage to Gross Income_\r\n\r\n                       1893                           1892\r\n          _Operating  _Fixed  _Surplus_  _Operating  _Fixed  _Surplus_\r\n           Expenses_  Charges_            Expenses_  Charges_\r\n\r\n  B. & O.    66.89     24.27    8.83       67.68     24.55     7.76\r\n  Erie       64.91     32.12    2.96       66.46     31.85     1.68\r\n  N.

These roads\r\nhad a more extensive margin which could be cut off before interest on\r\ntheir bonds should be endangered. Furthermore, this margin was secured,\r\nnot by low operating expenses, but by low fixed charges, including\r\ninterest on bonds. Operating expenses averaged higher than for the\r\npreceding group, fixed charges averaged much lower. In the first group\r\nbut one road had charges in 1893 which were less than 25 per cent of\r\ngross income; in the second group but two roads had charges which were\r\ngreater. The condition of the roads of the second group referred to was\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n             _Percentage to Gross Income_\r\n\r\n                                  1893\r\n                     _Operating  _Fixed\r\n                      Expenses_  Charges_  _Surplus_\r\n\r\n  C., B. & Q.          64.46      23.12      12.41\r\n  C., M. & St. P.      65.95      20.78      13.26\r\n  C., R. I. & P.       71.72      13.31      14.96\r\n  Great No.            50.44      34.54      15.01\r\n  Ill.

These are the creditors,\r\nwho find interest and perhaps principal of their bonds in default;\r\nthe stockholders; and the bankers and financiers who advance ready\r\nmoney and subscribe to necessary guarantees. Of these the creditors\r\nand the stockholders are widely scattered, and are quite unable\r\nto protect themselves by individual action. Their first impulse\r\nis, therefore, either to elect committees to represent them, or to\r\nauthorize self-appointed committees of well-known men to look after\r\ntheir interests. Stockholders in a reorganization have little voice.\r\nThey are the owners, and all that the corporation has is subject first\r\nto the bondholders from whom it has borrowed money. Occasionally\r\nthey seem to make their influence felt. In 1880 the Reading actually\r\nattempted to pay off its floating debt by bonds with a lien inferior to\r\nthe common stock; and in 1892 the Olcott plan for the reorganization of\r\nthe Richmond Terminal Company strongly favored the junior securities.\r\nBut as a rule stockholders must accept, and rightly, about what the\r\ncreditors desire.\r\n\r\nThe creditors, then, are the most important factors, and they, like\r\nthe stockholders, act through committees. There may be a committee for\r\nevery class of bonds, or one or more classes may join together. The\r\nUnion Pacific, in 1893, had committees for the consolidated first\r\nmortgage, the collateral trust 5s, the Oregon Railway & Navigation\r\nconsols, the Dutch bondholders, and certain branch lines; and in 1894\r\nfor the collateral trust 4½s and the Kansas Pacific consols. As the\r\nfinancial situation grew worse the interest on senior mortgages became\r\nimperilled, and even the Union Pacific first mortgage bondholders\r\ndeemed it wise to elect a committee; while a second committee arose\r\nfor the Kansas Pacific consols, and a new committee for the Denver\r\nExtension mortgage. By April, 1895, at least fifteen committees were\r\nin active operation, of which fourteen represented not more than\r\ntwo classes of bonds each. The Reading reorganization of 1884 to\r\n1886 was largely shaped by two committees representing the general\r\nmortgage bondholders; seven reorganization trustees representing\r\nthe foreign creditors, the general, income, junior securities, and\r\nstockholders; and an opposition committee known as the Lockwood\r\nCommittee. Within four months after the failure of the Erie in 1875\r\nthe English bondholders and stockholders each had elected a committee,\r\nand had urged all securityholders to join; a meeting of bondholders\r\nhad elected Mr. John Hooper chairman of a committee in New York;\r\nand another meeting had elected Mr. N. B. Lord chairman of another\r\ncommittee in that city.[691] The more general a committee the greater\r\nthe influence which it seems able to exert on reorganization, and\r\nthe greater the likelihood that the plan which it approves may be\r\naccepted. The fact that a scheme has to meet the criticism of opposing\r\ninterests during its formation renders it less likely to contain\r\nany injustice which conditions make it possible to avoid; and the\r\nendorsement of their representatives makes all classes of bondholders\r\nmore ready to accord it temperate consideration. Among the numerous\r\nUnion Pacific committees it was the joint committee, representing\r\nthe foreign holders, the Denver & Rio Grande, the Oregon Railway &\r\nNavigation, and other interests that took the leading part. In the\r\ncase of the Reading from 1884 to 1886 the seven reorganization trustees\r\noutweighed any other representatives of the creditors; in that of\r\nthe Northern Pacific the Adams Committee succeeded in becoming a\r\ngeneral reorganization committee, and took the leading part; and the\r\nAtchison reorganization was accomplished only by the union into a joint\r\nexecutive reorganization committee of three of the previously existing\r\nbodies.[692]\r\n\r\nThe situation which bankers and financiers occupy in relation to a\r\nbankrupt road is almost equally important. Their aid is essential to a\r\nreorganization while that of the officers and receivers of the company\r\nis not. And they are not subject to the pressure of imminent financial\r\nloss which forces creditors and stockholders to accept plans of which\r\nthey do not altogether approve. It is true that these bankers may have\r\nmoney invested in the securities of the road. It may even happen that\r\nthey have been formerly in control. In this case a certain pressure\r\ndoes exist. But as bankers their function is to do one or both of two\r\nthings; namely, to advance cash to keep the railroad system together\r\npending reorganization, and to underwrite assessments or the sale of\r\nsecurities. Either one of these involves them in new risks, and in\r\nundertaking either they will be only indirectly affected by investments\r\nwhich they may previously have made. Their influence on reorganization\r\nis strong because they are necessary, and because they are free to\r\nparticipate or not to participate according to their opinion of the\r\nprecise reorganization plan proposed. For much the same reason their\r\ninfluence is a wholesome one. We shall see that the primary conflict\r\nwhich takes place in any reorganization is between the interests\r\nof the corporation which needs a lessening of its burdens, and the\r\ninterests of the securityholders which is opposed to any reduction in\r\ntheir claims.[693] The degree to which the former interest prevails\r\ndetermines the strength of the reorganized company. In this conflict\r\nthe bankers naturally take the side of the company. As bankers, who\r\nadvance cash, and who usually receive their pay in securities, they\r\nwish to make the corporation prosperous, and to raise the quotations\r\nof its securities to a high figure. An important factor also is that\r\nas reputable banking firms they wish the future career of corporations\r\nwhich they have handled to reflect credit upon themselves.\r\n\r\nAn example of the influence of bankers and financiers appears in\r\nthe case of the Union Pacific. A committee comprising General Louis\r\nFitzgerald, Jacob Schiff, T. J. Coolidge, Oliver Ames, and two railway\r\npresidents took the road out of receivers’ hands, cut charges per\r\nmile by over one-half, and paid the Government’s claim in full. The\r\nReading reorganization of 1886 to 1887 was the work of a syndicate\r\nwhich took hold after interests closely connected with the properties\r\nhad failed to produce a satisfactory plan. The result was the best plan\r\never applied to the Reading Railroad. The Richmond Terminal Company\r\nwas reorganized by a single banking firm. In this case the operation\r\ncut charges less than could have been desired, though the other\r\nparts of the plan were well-advised. The intervention of a syndicate\r\nhas fortunately been usual of late years. And it is doubtful if the\r\ncompensation accorded has been exorbitant, even for the direct services\r\nrendered. In 1886 the Reading agreed to pay a syndicate 5 per cent\r\nupon $15,000,000 of subscribed capital, plus 6 per cent on all money\r\nadvanced. The Richmond Terminal paid Drexel, Morgan & Co. $100,000 in\r\ncash to cover their office expenses and $750,000 in common stock at $15\r\nper share[694] for their work of coöperation and supervision. The Union\r\nPacific paid the syndicate which financed its reorganization $5,000,000\r\nin preferred stock quoted at 59, or 19 per cent at current prices on a\r\nsubscribed capital of $15,000,000. All three syndicates, however, ran\r\nthe risk of depreciation in the value of the stock given them, and all\r\nthree rendered great service in providing large sums of cash at a time\r\nwhen capital was not readily to be obtained.\r\n\r\nPayments to bankers or trust companies receiving deposits of bonds\r\nand stocks and undertaking the clerical work of a reorganization,\r\nshould be sharply distinguished from those made to underwriting\r\nsyndicates above described. Depositaries assume no risk, and are paid\r\na definite sum for definite services performed. In 1895 the Erie set\r\nthe compensation of Messrs. J. P. Morgan & Co. and J. S. Morgan &\r\nCo., for their services as depositaries and in carrying out the plan\r\nof reorganization, at $500,000 in addition to all expenses incurred;\r\nand the same year the Union Pacific allowed $1,000,000 in preferred\r\nstock to the bankers who managed its underwriting syndicate, as\r\nagainst $5,000,000 to the syndicate itself. It should be said that\r\nthe compensation to depositaries is in part payment for the use of the\r\nname of the firms employed as well as in part payment for clerical work\r\nperformed. Bondholders are more ready to deposit their securities with\r\na well-known house than with an obscure one; and are to some extent\r\ninfluenced by the implied approval of the reorganization plan which\r\nacceptance of deposits by such houses involves.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the ordinary reorganization, then, creditors,\r\nstockholders, syndicate, and corporation find themselves face to\r\nface. The interests of the syndicate and of the corporation most\r\nnearly coincide except in so far as the syndicate is an owner of\r\nstocks or bonds. The syndicate desires a radical reorganization,—\r\nthe corporation requires it. But as between stock- and bondholders\r\nand the corporation; between the stockholders and the bondholders;\r\nor between the junior and the senior bondholders; there is well-nigh\r\ncomplete antagonism. The corporation, to repeat, needs a reduction in\r\nthe fixed charges which it has to pay. The securityholders wish to lose\r\nas little as possible. The stockholders hope to force sacrifices from\r\nthe bondholders, and the bondholders to levy a heavy assessment upon\r\nthe stock. The junior bondholders call upon their seniors to bear their\r\npart; and the seniors reply that they are well secured and that the\r\njuniors and the stock must take care of themselves.\r\n\r\nThe first question which arises is that of the cash requirements.\r\nHow much cash must be raised to pay off the floating debt, and how\r\nmuch working cash capital will the new corporation require? It is\r\nalmost always true that a large floating debt has accumulated prior\r\nto reorganization. The Northern Pacific in 1893 had a gross debt of\r\nno less than $15,000,000; the Reading in 1895 one of $13,800,000;\r\nthe Baltimore & Ohio in 1896 one of $13,000,000; the Atchison in\r\n1893 one of $16,000,000. In part this means simply the accumulation\r\nof unpaid bills. In part, however, it represents promissory notes or\r\nother short time paper which the corporation has issued, generally\r\nto pay current indebtedness, but occasionally for financing somewhat\r\nextensive operations. Thus Mr. McLeod carried his purchases of New\r\nEngland railroad stock by means of advances from brokers, and the\r\nGovernment Directors of the Union Pacific reported that $15,000,000\r\nout of $21,400,000 of floating debt of that road in 1891 were the\r\nresult of expenditure and advances in the construction of branch or\r\ntributary lines. The cost of carrying such indebtedness is naturally\r\nhigh. Mr. McLeod is reported to have paid an average of 9 per cent\r\nfor his loans. The reorganization committee of the Atchison stated\r\nin 1895 that during the five years preceding, the road had paid\r\nover $1,100,000 in discounts and commissions to secure the renewal\r\nof $9,000,000 of guarantee fund notes. And floating indebtedness is\r\nby far the most dangerous as well as the easiest sort of obligation\r\nto incur. It represents a possible demand for large sums of cash on\r\nshort notice which even a solvent company may find it impossible to\r\nmeet;—a demand, moreover, which is likely to be made at a moment\r\nof stringency in the money market. For this reason, and on account\r\nof the high interest demanded, corporations endeavor to fund their\r\nfloating debts when these reach unwieldy proportions. In 1891 the\r\nUnion Pacific authorized three-year 6 per cent notes to the amount of\r\n$24,000,000 to be used in taking up its floating debt. In 1893 the\r\nNorthern Pacific authorized $15,000,000 collateral five-year 6 per\r\ncent notes for the same purpose. In each case it was hoped to refund\r\nthese short time issues with bonds of longer term when the date of\r\ntheir maturity should arrive. After a company has been in receivers’\r\nhands, issues of receivers’ certificates are pretty sure to swell\r\nthe current liabilities. These, again, may be issued to pay current\r\nbills, or to maintain or to improve the railroad when other resources\r\nprove insufficient. For whatever reason incurred, it is plain that the\r\nproblem of the floating debt is a serious one for the creditors and\r\nowners of a bankrupt road to meet. If the provision which they make is\r\ninsufficient their company will not regain a safe financial footing.\r\nAnd if, in addition to cancelling the debt outstanding, they do not\r\nprovide a margin for working capital, the company will be forced to\r\nincur new floating debt and their work will have to be done over again.\r\n\r\nIn general there are two ways by which cash for floating debt and\r\nworking capital can be raised:\r\n\r\n(1) By assessment on securityholders. (2) By the sale of securities.\r\n\r\nSales of securities may comprise the sale of securities of the\r\nbankrupt, or of other corporations held in that company’s treasury,\r\nor they may be sales of part of new bond or stock issues reserved for\r\nthat purpose. In 1898 the Baltimore & Ohio sold among other things\r\n$3,800,000 of Western Union Telegraph stock held in its treasury since\r\n1887; while in 1889 the Atchison issued and sold $12,500,000 general\r\nmortgage 4s and $1,250,000 income 5s. When outside securities are sold\r\nthe value of which is in no way dependent upon the prosperity of the\r\nroad which sells them; and which are such, moreover, as the selling\r\nroad can readily spare, this method of raising capital is open to few\r\nobjections. Its chief disadvantage is that the sale is apt to be made\r\nat a time when the level of general prosperity is not high, and the\r\nprice obtained is therefore apt to be low. But the question is quite\r\ndifferent when the securities are those of the embarrassed or bankrupt\r\nroad itself. In this case the credit of the company and the price of\r\nits securities are sure to be at a low ebb. The initial sacrifice\r\nentailed is necessarily great; while if the securities sold are bonds,\r\nas they are almost sure to be, the company increases its annual\r\ninterest charge without receiving an equivalent value in return. If, on\r\nthe other hand, the railroad endeavors to prevent a rise in charges by\r\nthe use of income bonds or stock, the gain is usually neutralized by\r\nthe extremely low price obtained.[695] In general we may say that sale\r\nof a railroad’s securities in time of general depression is impossible\r\nexcept at a ruinous sacrifice; that sales should not be resorted to at\r\nall except when the road’s difficulties are acute rather than chronic,\r\nas in the case of the Reading in 1896; and that when securities are to\r\nbe sold the best of the available bond issues should be used and not\r\nthe worst.\r\n\r\nThe case of an assessment is very different. Securities may be sold\r\nto outsiders or to present securityholders. In the one event no\r\npressure at all can be brought to bear; in the other only that of the\r\nindirect loss which the difficulties of the reorganizing company would\r\ninvolve.[696] An assessment, on the other hand, is levied solely on\r\nsecurityholders and is compulsory. Stockholders or bondholders who\r\nrefuse to pay are ordinarily debarred from all participation in the\r\nreorganization, and lose all chance to recoup their losses from their\r\nshare in subsequent prosperity. In return for the assessment some\r\nsecurity is usually given, so that from one point of view an assessment\r\nand a sale resemble each other. But the element of compulsion appears\r\nin this: namely, that in the case of a sale the new securities are\r\ntaken at the buyers’ valuation; but in the case of an assessment the\r\ncompany determines what it shall give for the cash paid in. Hence the\r\nusual compensation for an assessment is an equal nominal amount of\r\npreferred stock;—while that for the purchase money in a sale is a\r\ngreater nominal amount in bonds. Either an assessment or a sale of\r\nsecurities may be fortified by a syndicate guarantee. In the one case\r\nthe syndicate agrees to substitute itself for all non-assenting or\r\ndefaulting stock- or junior bondholders; in the other it engages to\r\ntake and dispose of the new securities offered, or such part of them as\r\nthe company is unable to sell. The advantages of syndicate assistance\r\nwe have already discussed.\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that both assessments and sales of securities have\r\nbeen freely employed in the reorganizations which have been considered,\r\nand that syndicate guarantees have been of ordinary occurrence. Out\r\nof eighteen reorganizations, fourteen were forced to pay attention\r\nto the raising of cash; the four which did not consisting of the\r\nconsolidation of the Union Pacific with the Kansas Pacific and of the\r\nChicago, Rock Island & Pacific with its branch lines in 1880, the\r\nincome conversion reorganization of the Atchison in 1892, and the Rock\r\nIsland reorganization of 1902,—each a reorganization of a more or\r\nless peculiar nature. Of the fourteen remaining, four provided cash by\r\nassessment, three by the issue of securities, and five by a combination\r\nof both methods. Adding to this the Northern Pacific reorganization\r\nof 1896 and that of the Erie in 1859, which combined an assessment\r\nwith funding provisions, we have eleven reorganizations which relied\r\non assessments in whole or in part. This preponderance is, however,\r\ndue to the extensive use of assessments from 1893 to 1898; since the\r\nearlier reorganizations show assessments in only about one-half of\r\nthe cases. This does not mean that the value of an assessment was not\r\nunderstood before 1893. For the reorganization of the Northern Pacific\r\nin 1895 was otherwise so radical that an assessment was less necessary;\r\nand that of the Atchison in 1889 took place at a time when business\r\nconditions were not in general depressed. The effect of widespread\r\ndepression on the means employed for raising cash is, however,\r\nperfectly clear.[697]\r\n\r\nOf the reorganizations of 1893 to 1898, to repeat, there was none which\r\nwe have considered which did not make use of assessments. The following\r\ntable shows the amount and distribution thereof:\r\n\r\n                             _Assessments, 1893–8_\r\n\r\n              _Common      _1st         _2d\r\n               Stock_    Preferred_   Preferred_  _Junior Securities_\r\n\r\n  Atchison       $10                    $20       4 per cent on 2d\r\n                                                    mortgage and income\r\n  B. & O.         20        $2\r\n  Erie            12         8\r\n  N.

Pac.         15\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that the assessments varied from $7.20 on the East\r\nTennessee to $20 on Reading common, with less sums on the preferred\r\nstock and the junior securities.[698] The real sacrifice demanded of\r\nthe stockholders is ascertained by deducting from the above the value\r\nof securities given for assessments whenever such were allowed. Taking\r\nfor the purpose the market quotations of these securities six months\r\nafter actual reorganization, that is, after the sale of the road, or\r\nthe putting into effect of the plan proposed, it appears that the\r\ncommon stock of the Atchison received $1.90; that of the Baltimore &\r\nOhio $15.20; that of the Richmond Terminal $5.02; that of the East\r\nTennessee $3.55; and that of the Union Pacific $8.10. The Erie, the\r\nNorthern Pacific, and the Reading gave nothing for assessments in\r\nthe nineties.[699] Preferred stock, whenever assessed, received the\r\nsame relative amount and kind of securities for assessment as did the\r\ncommon stock, and the same is true of the junior securities. Since,\r\nhowever, these new securities had but a prospective value at the time\r\nof the issue of the various reorganization plans, it is advisable to\r\nmake no attempt to determine precisely the net assessment, and to call\r\nattention to their allowance merely as a fact on which the stockholders\r\ncould rely as they could count on a future rise in the value of their\r\nshares. With this qualification the relative height of assessments and\r\nstock quotations one month after the publication of each reorganization\r\nplan, and six months after the completion of each reorganization may be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n                            _Six Reorganizations, 1893–8_\r\n\r\n                           _Common Stock_             _Preferred Stock_\r\n\r\n                                   _Price                       _Price\r\n                         _Price   6 months            _Price   6 months\r\n                         1 month   after              1 month    after\r\n              _Assess-    after   reorgan-  _Assess-   after   reorgan-\r\n               ments_     plan_   ization    ments_    plan_   ization_\r\n\r\n  Atchison      $10       $ 5¾       $13⅛\r\n  B. & O.        20        12⅜        56¾     $20             $114\r\n  Erie           12         8½        14⅛       8      $22      36⅛\r\n  N.

The difference ranged\r\nfrom $3.50 for the Erie to $17⅔ for the Reading; in other words the\r\nassessments wiped out the whole value remaining to common stockholders,\r\nand exacted an additional contribution as the price of participation\r\nin any future prosperity. In the case of the preferred stock, where\r\nvalues were greater and assessments less heavy, the results were not\r\nthe same; but even here the proportional demand was large, and amounted\r\nto 100 per cent of current quotations in the case of the Northern\r\nPacific. Before 1893 assessments were fewer in number and not so great\r\nin amount. It is to the subsequent rise in stock quotations to which\r\nwe must turn for an explanation of the willingness of stockholders to\r\ncontribute such heavy sums. The assessments, we find, did not come\r\nout of the stockholders’ pockets in the end; for their payment, in\r\nconnection with other features of reorganization, so enhanced the value\r\nof shares that only six months after reorganization the price of stocks\r\nin all cases was nearly equal to the assessment plus the previous\r\nmarket quotation. In some instances, such as the Baltimore & Ohio,\r\nthe sum amounted to much more than this total.[701] Refusal to pay\r\nwould have wiped out the stockholder’s interest and have kept him from\r\nbenefiting from the rise. It is needless to add that quotations to-day\r\nare many times the amount of the assessments. The increase in value has\r\noccurred alike for common and preferred stock, even in times of severe\r\ndepression. On the whole, it has abundantly justified the payments\r\nwhich stockholders were asked to make.\r\n\r\nThe use of assessments alone represents the most radical and the\r\nsoundest method of raising cash. It disposes of the accumulated quick\r\nliabilities once and for all; and involves no subsequent increase\r\nin interest charges. It was the method of the Atchison and the Union\r\nPacific after 1893, of the Reading from 1883–6, and of the Erie from\r\n1875–7. It was furthermore the method of the Western, New York &\r\nPennsylvania in 1893,[702] of the Norfolk & Western in 1896,[703] and\r\nof other railroads which might be named. Probably its most drastic\r\napplication was in the case of the Houston & Texas Central in 1887,\r\nwhere an assessment of 73 per cent was found necessary to discharge the\r\nfloating debt and to provide cash payments for interest and bonus to\r\nfirst mortgage bondholders, and to pay the charges, expenses, and other\r\nliabilities made or incurred by the Trust Company.[704]\r\n\r\nThe sale of securities also has been relied upon for the production\r\nof cash. The most striking example of the use of securities alone is\r\nafforded by the Reading reorganization of 1883, which at the same\r\ntime illustrates the possible unsoundness of the method. The floating\r\ndebt of the Reading companies amounted in June, 1880, to $12,155,248,\r\nthe bulk having been incurred in attempts to maintain solvency. To\r\ncover this Mr. Gowen proposed an issue of $34,300,000 deferred income\r\nbonds,[705] to be sold at 30 per cent of their par value, and to be\r\nentitled to dividends after 6 per cent had been paid on the common\r\nstock. These securities were practically worthless, and had to be set\r\naside in favor, first, of new general mortgage bonds, and then of old\r\nunissued general mortgage 7 per cent bonds which the company happened\r\nto have in its treasury. So ineffective was even this expedient that\r\nin October, 1884, the floating debt amounted to a sum nearly one-third\r\ngreater than that reported in 1880. Another example was the Erie scheme\r\nof 1886, which was not, however, a reorganization, according to our\r\ndefinition. The floating debt of the Erie in September, 1884, amounted\r\nto $5,455,338, of which $1,007,922 consisted of unpaid coupons. On the\r\nsuggestion of English securityholders these coupons were funded; and\r\nthe balance was raised by a new terminal mortgage issued and disposed\r\nof by a subsidiary terminal corporation known as the Long Dock Company.\r\nThe result was an increase in fixed charges, which contributed to the\r\nfinal failure in 1893. The history of the Southern Railway affords a\r\nthird example. At the end of 1888 the Richmond & West Point Terminal\r\nRailway & Warehouse Company found itself with a floating debt of\r\n$5,000,000, and proceeded to authorize an issue of $24,300,000 5 per\r\ncent 25-year collateral trust bonds, of which $5,000,000 were to be\r\nsold to cancel this indebtedness. In subsequent years the current\r\nliabilities again increased, and for this and other reasons a general\r\nreorganization became necessary, in which both an assessment and a sale\r\nof securities were required. On the whole the result of experience\r\nbears out the statement as to the unsoundness of reliance on the\r\nissue of securities for cash even when the sale of the securities is\r\nguaranteed.\r\n\r\nYet another method of raising cash has been the combination of\r\nassessments with the sale of bonds or stock or both. In 1898 the\r\nBaltimore & Ohio disposed of $3,800,000 Western Union Telegraph stock.\r\nIt also provided a total of $37,900,000 prior lien and first mortgage\r\nbonds and preferred stock, which was in part given for assessments,\r\nand in part turned over to a syndicate in return for cash. The Erie,\r\nin 1895, besides its assessment sold $15,000,000 in prior lien bonds;\r\nwhile the Reading sold $4,000,000 in new general mortgage bonds and\r\n$8,000,000 in new first preferred stock. In each case the success of\r\nthe sale was ensured by a syndicate agreement. In 1886, to go outside\r\nof the reorganizations which have been particularly described, the\r\nTexas & Pacific provided funds with which to cancel a part of its\r\nfloating debt by an assessment of $10 and an issue of $6,500,000 common\r\nstock. Three years later, the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas assessed its\r\nsecond mortgage bondholders 5 per cent and its stock 10 per cent and\r\nsold securities to the par value of $4,490,880 to cover $3,400,000\r\nof cash requirements.[706] In 1894 the New York & New England issued\r\n$4,355,000 in securities and levied $20 and $25 respectively upon its\r\ncommon and preferred shares.[707] In 1896 the St. Louis & San Francisco\r\nplanned to raise $821,410 by assessment and $5,500,000 by sale of\r\nsecurities. Such examples might be multiplied indefinitely.[708]\r\n\r\nThe problem of cash requirements must be met and solved before the\r\nparties interested can consider the fixed charges. It is the reduction\r\nin charges, nevertheless, which is usually of the more fundamental\r\nimportance. A floating debt accumulated through inability to pay\r\ncurrent expenses is the direct result of excessive charges, and a\r\nsettlement which did not lower these, as well as pay off the debt,\r\ncould give but temporary relief. Only when failure has been due to\r\nspecial causes can a decrease in the annual burden be even a matter for\r\ndebate.

Even before\r\n1893, however, the fact that reductions must be made was apparent.\r\nThree reorganizations increased absolute charges instead of decreasing\r\nthem. Of these the Atchison reorganization of 1892 was not due to\r\nlack of prosperity, and the Erie reorganization was a failure. The\r\nReading reorganization of 1880 increased absolute charges, increased\r\nmileage more than correspondingly, but was also a failure. And it is\r\nsignificant that only those roads which generously reduced charges\r\nregained even a temporary prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of losses which a reduction in fixed charges requires\r\ncan best be made by a comprehensive redistribution of securities. All\r\nthe bonds and stocks which are to suffer must be called in; and varying\r\namounts of new securities must be given in their place. Among the\r\nimportant considerations to those who fix the rates for exchanges are\r\nthese:\r\n\r\n(1) Maximum charges under the new régime should approximate minimum net\r\nearnings under the old.\r\n\r\n(2) As large a proportion of the charges as possible should consist of\r\nthe one item of interest on bonds.\r\n\r\n(3) Losses should fall most heavily on the junior securityholders.\r\n\r\n(4) The nominal value of outstanding securities should be reduced as\r\nlittle as possible.\r\n\r\n(5) Bondholders whose claims have been cut down should be afforded some\r\nchance to participate in future increased earnings of the property.\r\n\r\nThese rules may be considered in turn. The point to which the best\r\npractice should reduce fixed charges is readily understood. Nothing\r\nless than solvency under the least favorable conditions is the\r\ngoal toward which a reorganization plan should strive. It appears,\r\naccordingly, that the minimum earnings of the Atchison property from\r\n1891–4 had been $5,204,880; while the fixed charges proposed for it\r\nwere $4,528,547. The lowest net earnings which the Union Pacific had\r\never recorded had been $4,315,077. The interest on its new bonded\r\nindebtedness was placed at $4,000,000. The net earnings for the\r\nNorthern Pacific in 1895 were $6,052,660, which was the least that the\r\nroad had earned for eight years. The new fixed charges were estimated\r\nat $6,015,846. The minimum net earnings of the Baltimore & Ohio from\r\n1887 to 1898 had been $6,610,774. The fixed charges of the plan of 1898\r\nwere set at $6,252,351.\r\n\r\nIn order to simplify the charges, as well as for other reasons, it\r\nis desirable to have the item of interest bear a large proportion to\r\nthe whole. The fixed charges of six of our seven reorganizations from\r\n1893–8 amounted together to $54,562,165. Of this sum, interest on bonds\r\ncomprised $35,239,146 or some 64 per cent. The charges of the same\r\nrailroads after reorganization amounted to $36,533,040, of which sum\r\ninterest on bonds comprised $30,926,638 or 84 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of losses should bear most heavily on the junior\r\nsecurities. The simplest readjustment would seem at first sight\r\nto demand a proportionate concession from all creditors. But this\r\nwould be both unjust and impossible. In no sense do all bond- and\r\nstockholders stand upon an equal footing. In the first place, the\r\ncost at which senior bondholders have acquired their claims has much\r\nexceeded the cost at which junior bondholders and stockholders have\r\nacquired securities of equal nominal amount. Apparently equal claims\r\nrepresent very unequal investment. In the second place this increased\r\ncost has been due to certain legal provisions touching security which\r\nbecome prominent during reorganization. All mortgage bonds possess\r\nby law a lien upon the property pledged to secure them. Upon default\r\nin repayment of principal, and usually also upon default in payment\r\nof regular interest, their owners have the right to sell the pledged\r\nproperty at auction and to recoup themselves from the proceeds. After\r\nthe underlying bonds have been satisfied the selling price is applied\r\nas far as it will go to the settlement in full of mortgages in the\r\norder of their issue; while the stock, representing the owners of the\r\nproperty, takes what is left. As a rule a railroad will not sell for\r\nanything like the sum required to pay off all its mortgages, and the\r\njunior issues are threatened with extinction. Usually, however, it is\r\npossible for the junior to guarantee interest on the senior bonds, or\r\nto buy the railroad at foreclosure sale under some senior mortgage,\r\nthus preserving to themselves the benefit of the earning power of the\r\ncorporation. When this is done earnings are distributed according to\r\nthe relative priority of the various junior issues on penalty of still\r\nfurther foreclosure and readjustment. The principle of reorganization\r\nwhich is followed prescribes because of this the payment in full of all\r\nclaims which can be satisfied by the purchase price of the bankrupt\r\nrailroad at foreclosure sale, and the distribution of losses among the\r\nremainder according to the relative priority of their liens.\r\n\r\nThe consent of securityholders to a reduction in their claim to an\r\nannual return is more easily obtained if the nominal value of their\r\nholdings be little or not at all reduced. There is a magic in the par\r\nvalue stamped upon a certificate which affords a certain consolation\r\nto those from whom sacrifices in interest are demanded. An unimpaired\r\nprincipal, moreover, constitutes a real advantage when the date of\r\nmaturity arrives. But if the low earning power of the corporation\r\ncompels it to ask sacrifices from the holders of its securities, it is\r\nonly fair that these sacrifices should cease when the earning power\r\nimproves. In other words, it is but just that old bondholders be given\r\nsecurities upon which payment of interest is optional, so that they may\r\nshare in future prosperity, and obtain the same return which they once\r\nenjoyed whenever the road earns enough to pay it.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing rules dictate the amount of reduction to be made in\r\ncharges, and also the kind and amount of new securities which are\r\nusually offered in the exchanges. Interest and rentals must be cut down\r\nwithout decreasing the nominal value of the securities outstanding. To\r\nreduce interest without reducing nominal value, either the interest\r\nrate on outstanding securities must be lowered, or mortgage bonds must\r\nbe replaced by income bonds or by stock. To reduce rentals annual\r\npayments may be arbitrarily cut down, or rental contracts may be funded\r\ninto mortgage bonds. These different methods may be taken up in some\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying tables (see opposite page) show for fourteen\r\nreorganizations the number and amounts of outstanding issues before and\r\nafter reorganization at the various rates of interest designated.\r\n\r\nFew collections of figures in railway finance deserve more careful\r\nattention than those given in these tables. Whereas the greatest number\r\nof the issues before the seven reorganizations prior to 1893 bore 6 per\r\ncent, and the greatest amount outstanding was similarly at that rate;\r\nthe overwhelming preponderance in amount after the reorganizations of\r\n1893–8 bore 4 per cent, and a total of 14.7 per cent of all the bonds\r\noutstanding bore a lower rate of interest than had appeared at all at\r\nthe earlier date.\r\n\r\n                                 BOND ISSUES\r\n\r\n                       _Seven Reorganizations, 1893–8_\r\n\r\n               _Before_                         _After_\r\n  _Per-                        _Per-                           _Per-\r\n  Cent_  _Number_   _Amount_   Cent_    _Number_    _Amount_   Cent_\r\n\r\n   7        33    $56,741,222    6.1       13    $43,942,500     4.9\r\n   6        85    300,925,695   32.7       30     82,586,000     9.3\r\n   5        51    267,623,426   29.0       23     90,853,035    10.3\r\n   4½       11     34,490,800    3.7        5     13,400,000     1.5\r\n   4         9    260,055,689   28.2       16    520,709,117    59.0\r\n   3½                                       2     76,733,350     8.7\r\n   3                                        1     53,350,000     6.0\r\n           ---   ------------   ----       --   ------------    ----\r\n           189   $919,836,832   99.7       90   $881,574,002    99.7\r\n  Not specified     5,141,238                      1,000,529\r\n                 ------------                   ------------\r\n                 $924,978,070                   $882,574,531\r\n\r\n                      _Seven Reorganizations before 1893_\r\n\r\n   7        40   $153,251,000   23.7       21    $81,327,544    10.3\r\n   6        59    173,641,790   26.8       55    150,999,589    19.1\r\n   5        22    174,060,032   26.9       16    180,341,768    22.8\r\n   4½        2      4,611,000     .7        1         79,000      .01\r\n   4         5    140,041,700   21.6        5    375,881,614    47.6\r\n           ---   ------------   ----       --   ------------    ----\r\n           128   $645,605,522   99.7       98   $788,629,515    99.81\r\n  Not specified     5,712,749                      8,940,939\r\n                 ------------                   ------------\r\n                 $651,318,271                   $797,570,454\r\n\r\nGraphically indicated the change was as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Period prior to 1893]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Period of 1893–8.]\r\n\r\nComparing the total interest with the total bond issue, we find the\r\naverage rate to have decreased from 5.5 per cent to 4.9 per cent by\r\nthe reorganizations prior to 1893, and from 5.1 per cent to 4.3 per\r\ncent by the reorganizations of 1893–8. Of some significance is a\r\ncomparison of the rates prior to the reorganizations before 1893 with\r\nthose subsequent to the reorganizations of 1893–8. The total interest\r\npayable on the issues at the later date was $38,291,319. If the same\r\nproportions of bonds had been issued at the same rates of interest as\r\nbefore the reorganizations prior to 1893, this interest would have\r\namounted to $48,552,688. The total interest payable on the issues\r\nbefore the reorganizations prior to 1893 was $35,658,192. If the same\r\nproportions of bonds had been then outstanding at the same rates as\r\nafter the reorganizations of 1893–8 the interest charge would have been\r\n$27,941,807. Thus in the first case there would have been a saving of\r\n$10,261,369 annually, and in the second case one of $8,279,775. This\r\ncomputation is inexact because it fails to take account of the normal\r\nreduction of interest rates due to improved credit and to increased\r\nprosperity from causes other than reorganization; but it is included\r\nhere because, in the first place, a large part of the reduction was due\r\nto actual reorganization; and in the second place, because much of the\r\nimproved credit is attributable indirectly to reductions of charges and\r\nother reorganization features.\r\n\r\nIt should be noticed that the new bond issues not only bore lower rates\r\nof interest, but were of greater volume and of longer term than the\r\nissues which they replaced. The greater volume is reflected in the\r\nconsiderable reduction in the number of issues at the same time that\r\nthe total amount of bonds outstanding decreased slightly or increased.\r\nThus the reorganizations before 1893 increased the amount of bond\r\nissues from $645,605,522 to $788,629,515, and decreased their number\r\nfrom 128 to 98; while the reorganizations of 1893–8 decreased the\r\namount of bonds from $919,836,832 to $881,574,002, and decreased the\r\nnumber of issues from 189 to 90, or in far greater proportion.[714]\r\nThe matter may be viewed in another way. Just before the beginning of\r\nthe later reorganizations the predominant rate of interest for the\r\nroads concerned was 6 per cent. The number of issues at 6 per cent\r\noutstanding was 85 and the average amount per issue was $3,540,302. The\r\npredominant rate just after those reorganizations was 4 per cent. The\r\nnumber of issues at 4 per cent outstanding was 16, and the average\r\namount per issue was $32,544,319. In other words, the process was to\r\nreplace numerous small issues which bore high rates of interest, by a\r\nfew comprehensive issues at lower rates; thus simplifying the financial\r\nsituation, as well as lightening the burdens which the roads had to\r\nbear.\r\n\r\nThe lengthening of the terms for which the various mortgages were\r\nto run is equally apparent. Before its reorganization in 1897 the\r\nUnion Pacific had no mortgage issued for more than 40 years. The\r\nfirst mortgage of 1897 ran for 50 years. The Reading in 1895 had four\r\nmortgages, all issued during the reorganization of 1888, with terms of\r\n70 years. All its other mortgages were for shorter periods. In 1897 it\r\nput forth a grand divisional mortgage with a term of 100 years. The\r\nErie in 1894 had two mortgages of 91 years each and one of 84 years,\r\nissued during the financial scandals of 1869, but no other of over\r\n$1,000,000 which ran for more than 43 years. Both its prior lien and\r\nits general mortgage bonds now outstanding are to mature 101 years from\r\ndate of issue. The Atchison in 1889 could boast of only one mortgage\r\nwith a term of 51 years. Its reorganization at that time gave it two\r\nof 100 years. The Northern Pacific issued one 100-year mortgage in the\r\ncourse of its troubles in 1889, and two mortgages for 101 and 150 years\r\nrespectively in its reorganization of 1896. The reason for long terms\r\nhas been the wish to make new mortgages attractive. Reorganization\r\nmortgages, as has just been said, tend to be large mortgages, at a\r\nlessened rate of interest. They are also blanket mortgages with an\r\ninferior lien. Some inducement besides the compulsion of necessity\r\nis useful in securing the assent of old bondholders to the proposed\r\nexchanges of these bonds for outstanding securities. The long-term bond\r\nprotects the holder against the probable steady fall in the rate of\r\ninterest on capital. It promises him advantage in the future in return\r\nfor surrender in the present.\r\n\r\nThe reduction in charges by the substitution, for mortgage bonds\r\nwith fixed interest, of securities upon which payment of interest\r\nis optional, has been as important as the reduction in the rates of\r\ninterest just described. Such securities may be either income bonds\r\nor stock. The income bond has a lien upon railroad property similar\r\nin kind to the lien of an ordinary mortgage. Upon default in the\r\npayment of its principal it can exercise foreclosure rights. But it\r\nhas no claim on earnings except in a right to receive dividends out of\r\nnet earnings before any dividend shall be paid upon the stock. Stock\r\ncertificates control the company by their right to vote,[715] but are\r\nentitled to its profits only after expenses of every kind have been\r\nmet. When divided into preferred and common shares the former receive\r\npreference in dividends and sometimes in voting power. Among the\r\nreorganizations described in the text three made use of income bonds\r\nbefore 1893 and one after 1893. The amounts of the issues and the\r\npercentages of incomes to total capitalization before and after the\r\nreorganizations were as follows:\r\n\r\n                             _Income Bonds_\r\n\r\n                                                  _Per cent_\r\n                     _Before_       _After_    _Before_  _After_\r\n\r\n  Atchison, ’95                   $51,728,000              31.8\r\n  Atchison, ’89                    80,000,000              35.4\r\n  Reading, ’83     $22,347,227     56,389,466     21.7     39.3\r\n  Reading, ’80      11,678,500     18,737,709     15.0     19.3\r\n\r\nThe East Tennessee reorganization of 1886 did away with income bonds,\r\nas did that of the Atchison in 1892. It will be noted that these bonds\r\nwere more used before 1893, owing probably to the fact that the name\r\nof bond was considered to increase the salability of a security on the\r\nmarket. Securityholders hesitated to accept stock, but received bonds\r\nwithout too great a protest. The extent to which railroads catered to\r\nthis preference is seen in the case of the Reading deferred income\r\nbonds, on which payment of interest was deferred to a 6 per cent\r\ndividend upon the common stock. From certain points of view, however,\r\nthe income bond is inferior to preferred stock. For instance, preferred\r\nstock almost always has voting power, while income bonds usually have\r\nnone. And although the income bondholder is sometimes protected from\r\nthe insertion of new claims upon earnings between his bond and the\r\nunderlying property, provisions in preferred stock certificates may\r\nafford an equal guarantee. In consequence, the use of income bonds has\r\ndeclined as a more accurate knowledge of their limitations has become\r\nwidespread, and the Atchison adjustment 4s represent the sole use of\r\nthis security in our reorganizations from 1893–8.\r\n\r\nThe exchange of preferred stock, with or without new bonds, for old\r\nbonds which have borne a fixed interest rate represents the best\r\ncurrent practice. Six of the seven principal railways reorganized from\r\n1893–8 retired old bonds with fixed interest by new bonds and preferred\r\nstock or by preferred stock alone. Take for illustration the case of\r\nthe Erie, which exchanged new general lien bonds and preferred stock\r\nfor old second consolidated bonds; of the Northern Pacific, which\r\nexchanged new prior or general lien bonds and preferred stock for its\r\nsecond and third mortgages; of the Union Pacific, which gave 4 per cent\r\nbonds and preferred stock for its old first mortgage 6s; exchanges\r\nwhich are but typical of a widely extended use. Even the Reading, which\r\nalone refused so to lighten the claims upon its earnings, employed\r\npreferred stock in retirement of old first, second, and third income\r\nbonds.\r\n\r\nThese issues were all protected from future introduction of new bonds\r\nbetween them and their property. The preferred stock certificates of\r\nthe Atchison in 1897 contain the following words: “No mortgage, other\r\nthan its general and its adjustment mortgage, executed in December,\r\n1895, shall be executed by the company, nor shall the amount of the\r\npreferred stock be increased unless the execution of such mortgage and\r\nsuch increase of preferred stock shall have received the consent of\r\nthe holders of a majority of the whole amount of the preferred stock\r\nwhich shall at the time be outstanding, given at a meeting of the\r\nstockholders called for that purpose, and the consent of the holders\r\nof a majority of such part of the common stock as shall be represented\r\nat that meeting.” Similar restrictions were imposed by the Southern\r\nin 1893, by the Erie in 1895, by the Northern Pacific in 1896, by the\r\nReading in 1896, and by the Baltimore & Ohio in 1898; or in other words\r\nby all the large corporations except the Union Pacific, whose failures\r\nin the nineties we have described.\r\n\r\nAs for the years before 1893, in them the use of preferred stock\r\nwas known, if not so widely resorted to. The East Tennessee in 1886\r\noffered new consols and preferred stock for old consols, divisional\r\nand debenture bonds. In 1881 securityholders of the Reading proposed,\r\nand in 1886 nearly secured, the adoption of plans which comprised\r\nextensive issues of preferred stock in exchange or in partial exchange\r\nfor old mortgages. The influence of English capital, however, and the\r\nliking for the name of bond to which we have referred seems to have\r\nprevented large employment of the device. Where either preferred stock\r\nor income bonds were used protection was afforded. When, in 1875, all\r\nthe outstanding bonds of the Northern Pacific were replaced by stock,\r\nprovision was made for an issue of first mortgage bonds to an average\r\nof $25,000 per mile of road completed; but no other bonds were to be\r\nissued except on a vote of at least three-fourths of the preferred\r\nstock at a meeting specially held in reference thereto on thirty days’\r\nnotice. In the Reading reorganization of 1886 a clause provided that\r\nin calculating the net earnings from which dividends on income bonds\r\nshould be paid there should be deducted from gross profits operating\r\nexpenses, taxes and existing rentals, guarantees and interest charges,\r\nbut not fixed charges of the same sort subsequently created. And in\r\nthe case of the Atchison in 1889 the provision that no bonds could\r\nbe inserted between the incomes and the general mortgage 4s was so\r\nabsolute as to prove an almost complete bar to new issues.\r\n\r\nIt is this use of preferred stock and income bonds which makes it\r\npossible to realize the last and highly important rule which the\r\nengineers of exchanges have in mind. Only by the combined use of\r\nsecurities upon which payment of interest is optional with securities\r\nupon which payment is obligatory can the claims which their\r\ncorporations are forced to meet be reduced, while at the same time\r\nformer bondholders are given the chance to share in future prosperity.\r\nSuch a result is deliberately sought. “The general theory of adjustment\r\nof disturbed bonds,” said the Richmond Terminal reorganization plan of\r\nMay, 1893, “has been to substitute for them the new 5 per cent bonds\r\nto such an extent as is warranted by the earnings and situation of the\r\nproperties covered by the present mortgages, and the new preferred\r\nstock for the remainder of the principal.” This purpose receives,\r\nmoreover, a natural development. Justice does not demand that old\r\nbondholders be given the unlimited chance at future surpluses which\r\nold stockholders should enjoy. Their former holdings could expect\r\nbut a fixed amount, and the maximum to be paid on their new bonds\r\nand preferred stock is therefore rightly restricted. But fair play\r\ndictates that they be given opportunity to receive the _same_ income\r\nas before. If they must surrender 6 per cent bonds in exchange for 4\r\nper cent bonds it is equitable to allow to them as well 50 per cent\r\nof their original holdings in new 4 per cent preferred stock. The\r\ncorporation thus announces its intention of saving them unharmed if it\r\ncan possibly do so, while it insists that its solvency be not dependent\r\non the success of its attempt. This idea has been realized in a number\r\nof cases with approximate exactness. The old third mortgage 6 per cent\r\nbonds of the Northern Pacific in 1896 received 118½ per cent in new 3\r\nper cents, 50 per cent in 4 per cent preferred stock, and 3 per cent in\r\ncash,—which together could yield nearly the same as the old mortgage.\r\nThe holders of Chicago Division 5s of the Baltimore & Ohio in 1898\r\nsurrendered an annual income of $50 for a chance to receive $50.30;\r\nthe Union Pacific first mortgage 6s in 1898 obtained precisely 100 per\r\ncent in new 4 per cent bonds and 50 per cent in new 4 per cent stock.\r\nIt would be too much to expect that such exactness should generally\r\nobtain. The variations in security between issues, the well-founded\r\ndesire to distinguish and not at the same time to swell unduly the\r\namount of new stock put forth lead to fluctuations both above and\r\nbelow the point of equivalence of return. The important fact to\r\nremember is in short this: that the use of bonds with a fixed rate of\r\ninterest, together with bonds or stock upon which payment of interest\r\nis optional, provides that compromise between the interests of the old\r\nbondholders and the interests of the corporation which alone can afford\r\njustice to both sides and can allow the reorganization to proceed.\r\n\r\nThe matter of rentals may now be considered. “The extent of the\r\nreduction in rentals from reorganization,” says one authority,[716] “is\r\nseen where the reduction of this item of fixed charges for the entire\r\ncountry is considered. The net reduction in lease rentals from 1892 to\r\n1898 was $24,527,000, and of this sum $17,768,000 appears in the South\r\nand West where the failures where most numerous and extensive. The\r\nreductions of rentals are most conspicuous in the Northwest and Pacific\r\ncoast railroads. It is true that a part of this decrease in rentals is\r\nto be ascribed to the steady movement in the direction of consolidation\r\nwhich is constantly converting lease into purchase; but coming so\r\nclose together, the difference between the figures of 1892 and those of\r\n1898 is sufficiently marked to warrant the conclusion that most of the\r\nreduction is due to the numerous reorganizations which intervened.”\r\n\r\nThis conclusion is at first sight borne out by the following tables,\r\nwhich show the decreases or increases in absolute rentals and interest\r\nfor thirteen reorganizations, of which six fall within the period\r\ncovered by the quotation:\r\n\r\n  KEY: _D_: _Decrease_\r\n       _I_: _Increase_\r\n                                      FIXED CHARGES\r\n\r\n                         _Six Reorganizations, 1893–8_\r\n\r\n                  _Interest_     _Rentals, etc._    _Total Charges_\r\n                  _D_    _I_       _D_    _I_          _D_    _I_\r\n\r\n  Atchison       40.6                    13.7         31.1\r\n  B. & O.               19.7      77.2                11.7\r\n  Erie                  33.3      62.7                 5.9\r\n  N.

Whereas absolute interest\r\ncharges were reduced by none of the later reorganizations by over 40\r\nper cent, four of the railroads cut rentals by over 60 per cent, and\r\ntwo others might have shown a similar result if a satisfactory division\r\nbetween interest and rentals could have been made. Unfortunately, both\r\nthese statistics and Meade’s statement are open to criticism for the\r\nreason which Meade recognized but to which he did not give sufficient\r\nweight. The relative amounts of interest and of rental paid by a\r\nrailroad at any time represent the method by which its system is held\r\ntogether. If a parent company raises money by the sale of bonds, and\r\npurchases its branches outright, or buys a majority of their shares,\r\nits interest charges will be large and its rentals small; if it leases\r\nthese same lines its interest payments will be small and its rentals\r\nlarge. A steady movement in the direction of consolidation doubtless\r\nexisted before 1893, but this movement was certainly accelerated by,\r\nand made a prominent feature of many of the reorganizations of the\r\nfollowing five years. Thus the Northern Pacific in 1893 reported a\r\ntotal length of line of 5431.92 miles; of which leased lines and\r\nlines operated under contract constituted 1912.92. In 1898, after\r\nreorganization and surrender of the Wisconsin Central, it reported\r\n4524.45 miles owned and operated, of which 2430.42 consisted of main\r\nline, and 2030.82 of branch lines owned. The Erie in 1893 reported\r\n551.12 miles leased and 598.51 operated for 32 per cent out of a total\r\nof 1970.32.[718] Four years later it either owned outright or held a\r\nmajority of the stock of 1806.92 miles out of a total of 2162.81. The\r\nBaltimore & Ohio operated 26.5 per cent of its mileage in 1897 under\r\nlease or contract, but had reduced this by 1899 to .5 per cent. The\r\nSouthern Railway proportion was 38.1 per cent in 1892 and 28.4 per cent\r\nin 1895. A reduction in rentals through reorganization has occurred,\r\nbut a reduction due nevertheless largely to consolidation of systems,\r\nrather than to revision of rental contracts.\r\n\r\nIt was partly because of the difficulty of exact statement on the\r\nsubject that a discussion of rentals was postponed till the matter of\r\ninterest should have been considered. It now appears that the reduction\r\nin interest payments which was so prominent took place in spite of a\r\nreduction in rentals. If, for instance, the annual interest charges\r\nfell $10,261,369 in the course of all reorganizations, and if in later\r\nyears the interest figures represented charges which at earlier date\r\nappeared as rentals, then the real reduction in interest was greater\r\nthan the figures show. It is true that consolidation is not responsible\r\nfor all of that decline in rentals which has occurred. It is as open to\r\na reorganizing railroad to continue old leases at easier terms as it is\r\nto absorb the leased roads into its system; and much of this has been\r\ndone. The East Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia, for instance, leased the\r\nMemphis & Charleston in 1877 for a yearly payment of $297,750; while\r\nthe Southern Railway Security Company a few years before had agreed\r\nto pay $318,763.50 annually for the same property. And it is a fact\r\nthat both consolidation and direct agreement have been the occasion of\r\nconsiderable reductions in the payments for the control of subsidiary\r\nlines. There is no reason why leased lines which have not earned their\r\nrentals should not suffer as much as portions of the main system which\r\nhave not earned interest on their bonds. On the whole, then, rentals\r\nhave decreased, both by means of direct negotiation and through an\r\nabsorption of leased roads into the main system accomplished by\r\nexchange of new securities for old. The significance of precise figures\r\nmust not be exaggerated. The losses which have occurred have been\r\ndistributed according to the same principles which have already been\r\ndetailed.\r\n\r\nIt is now clear that creditors, stockholders, and syndicate in\r\npractically all successful reorganizations agree that cash must be\r\nraised, fixed charges reduced, and the losses distributed according\r\nto the seniority of existing claims; and that of all methods the\r\ncomprehensive exchange of new securities for old is best suited\r\nto accomplish at least the last two of these necessities. To give\r\na comprehensive view of the operations the capitalization after\r\nreorganization of the roads which have been studied may be compared\r\nwith the capitalization before. It will then be possible to see at\r\na glance the consequences of the great variety of exchanges. The\r\nfollowing table gives the percentages which the stock and bonds of\r\nthese companies bear before and after reorganization to the total\r\ncapitalization before.\r\n\r\n  KEY: _B_: _Bonds_\r\n       _P_: _Preferred Stock_\r\n       _C_: _Common Stock_\r\n       _T_: _Total_\r\n                                    CAPITALIZATION\r\n\r\n                            _Seven Reorganizations, 1893–8_\r\n\r\n                            _Before_                     _After_\r\n                  _B_   _P_         _C_  _T_     _B_   _P_    _C_   _T_\r\n\r\n  Atchison       69.2              30.7  100    48.9  39.6   30.7  119.2\r\n  B. & O.        72.9   4.5        22.5  100   121.3  35.4   31.6  188.3\r\n  Erie           58.4   4.1        37.4  100    59.0  22.1   48.1  129.2\r\n  N.

This reflects\r\nthe exchange of new securities on which a lower rate of interest is\r\npayable with securities on which all payments are optional, for old\r\nsecurities which claim a high annual return. It is the result of the\r\nattempt to reduce the demands upon reorganized corporations without\r\nmaterially reducing the sums which old securityholders may in times of\r\nprosperity receive. It reflects also, however, the sale of securities\r\nfor ready cash, or the exchange of these for assessments, as well as\r\nthe investment of minor sums in the improvement of the roads. A closer\r\nexamination of the table shows that the increase comes chiefly in\r\nbonds before 1893 and in stock after that date. The average increase\r\nin bonds of the seven reorganizations before 1893 was 11.4 per cent\r\nand of common stock .9 per cent; whereas bonds decreased between the\r\nreorganizations of 1893–8 from 65.8 per cent to 59.1 per cent of the\r\nprevious capitalization, although common stock increased 9.2 per cent\r\nand there was introduced a great volume of preferred stock which is\r\nscarcely found at all before. The less radical nature of the early\r\nreorganizations and the use of income bonds instead of preferred\r\nstock as a security with optional interest are here apparent. In\r\nbrief, the statement of capitalization before and after reorganization\r\nsummarizes and confirms the conclusions which we have reached. A few\r\nfundamental principles have underlain the complicated details of the\r\nexchanges of new securities for old. These principles appear when the\r\nreorganizations are examined one by one, and they show not less clearly\r\nwhen all the reorganizations are taken in two general groups.\r\n\r\nAnother question now naturally arises. If an increased capitalization\r\nhas been obtained without an increase in charges, owing to the lowering\r\nof the rates of bond interest and to the liberal use of stocks or\r\nincome bonds, what has been the effect on the market value of the\r\nsecurities concerned? Is the aggregate value of the new securities less\r\nor greater than the aggregate value of the securities which they have\r\nreplaced? It has been seen that taken as a whole less annual payments\r\ncan be claimed from the railroads as of right. Has this fact decreased\r\naggregate quotations, or has the larger volume of securities and the\r\nchance for dividends over and above the minimum interest, raised such\r\nquotations higher than they were before? The following tables compare\r\nthe quotations of securities disturbed by the various reorganizations\r\none year before the failure of their railroads, with the quotations one\r\nyear after reorganization of the new securities issued to exchange\r\nfor them. A third column is inserted to show the effects of years of\r\nprosperity upon quotations subsequent to reorganization.\r\n\r\n                         _Seven Reorganizations, 1893–8_\r\n\r\n              _Lowest quotation    _Lowest quotation\r\n                 of month one         of month one\r\n                  year before          year after      _Lowest quotation\r\n                    failure_        reorganization_     December, 1906_\r\n\r\n  Atchison       $184,857,934        $129,364,451         $342,941,683\r\n  B. & O.          26,955,000          34,092,518           45,634,437\r\n  Erie             67,190,748          38,895,077           82,230,457\r\n  N.

Whereas the disturbed securities\r\nof the seven roads in question, multiplied by their quotations\r\none year before reorganization, give a product of $654,394,232,\r\nthe new bonds and stock given for the disturbed securities,\r\nmultiplied by their quotations one year after reorganization, give\r\na product of $548,027,663.[721] This is not true for three of the\r\nfour reorganizations before 1893, and it is not true for the\r\nreorganizations of the Baltimore & Ohio and of the Union Pacific in the\r\nlater period. Individual causes account for most of the difference.\r\nThe Reading reorganization of 1886–8 took place so soon after the\r\nprevious failure that our method makes it necessary to take the\r\nquotations of securities “before reorganization” only five days after\r\nthe railroad has left receivers’ hands. These figures are therefore\r\nunduly depressed. The Atchison reorganization of 1892 was voluntary,\r\nand was not caused by financial difficulties. The reorganizations of\r\nthe Union Pacific and of the Reading in 1897 and 1898 respectively\r\noccurred later than most of the other reorganizations and benefited\r\nfrom the sharp increase in stock and bond quotations which began in\r\n1897. For the seven reorganizations of 1893–8, to repeat, the aggregate\r\nmarket value of old securities before reorganization was greater than\r\nthe market value after reorganization of the new securities given\r\nin exchange for them. The smallest changes took place in the senior\r\nsecurities. In the case of the Northern Pacific the aggregate value\r\nof the three prior mortgages disturbed increased from $85,498,685 one\r\nyear before failure to $86,158,702 one year after foreclosure; while\r\nthe consolidated or blanket mortgage of the company decreased from\r\n$36,032,360 to $29,235,111. In the case of the Reading the value of the\r\ngeneral mortgage 4s increased from $37,160,977 to $37,383,503, while\r\nthe first, second, and third income bonds decreased from $32,353,497 to\r\n$22,784,700. The reason was not generally a smaller increase in volume,\r\nbut the fact that new bonds of fairly stable value were given for the\r\nbetter sorts of old securities, while old junior mortgages were apt to\r\nreceive new income bonds or preferred stock, of which the value varied\r\nwithin wide limits.\r\n\r\nThe wide difference in the nature of the securities of the different\r\nroads forbids any attempt at precise classification. The following\r\ndivisions may, however, be made: Three of the reorganizations from\r\n1893–8 retired branch-line bonds for which quotations are obtainable,\r\nwith a resultant increase in value for the issues of $3,256,127, or\r\n14.2 per cent. Five of the reorganizations dealt with what may be\r\nclassed as general mortgage bonds, and the value of the new securities\r\ngiven was to the value of the old as $182,160,406 to $196,186,382,\r\nor a decrease of 7.1 per cent. Three of the reorganizations retired\r\njunior bonds other than income. The value of the old securities\r\nwas $47,874,648 and that of the new $22,272,174, or a decrease of\r\n53.6 per cent. Four of the reorganizations retired income bonds. The\r\nvalue of the old securities was $40,913,662, the value of the new\r\nwas $28,177,721, and the decrease was 31.1 per cent. Three of the\r\nreorganizations retired old preferred stock, and reduced the aggregate\r\nmarket value from $36,509,662 to $13,825,138, or 62.1 per cent.\r\nFinally, the common stock decreased 21.3 per cent from an aggregate\r\nvalue of $125,160,409 to one of $98,316,060. Stated in tabular form the\r\nresult is as follows:\r\n\r\n                       _Value one      _Value one         _Per Cent\r\n                       year before     year after          increase\r\n                        failure_     reorganization_     or decrease_\r\n\r\n  Branch-line bonds    $22,840,928    $26,097,055          I. 14.2\r\n  General mortgages    196,186,382    182,160,406          D.  7.1\r\n  Junior mortgages      47,874,648     22,272,174          D. 53.6\r\n  Income mortgages      40,913,662     28,177,721          D. 31.1\r\n  Preferred stock       36,509,662     13,825,138          D. 62.1\r\n  Common stock         125,160,409     98,316,060          D. 21.3\r\n\r\nThis makes more definite the conclusion which has been outlined in\r\ngeneral terms before. The burden of the reorganizations from 1893–8\r\nfell on the junior securities and stockholders. The holders of prior\r\nlien bonds actually had more value than before one year only after\r\nreorganization had taken place; the general mortgage bondholders had\r\nnearly recouped their losses; while the former position of the other\r\ncreditors and of the stockholders was far from being regained.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that the decreases in market quotations were due to\r\na general decline in prices of securities and not to reorganizations\r\nof the roads in question. This objection, however, cannot hold. It is\r\ntrue that a general decline began in the United States in February,\r\n1893, and continued through 1894, reaching its lowest point in August,\r\n1893, and, after that, in March, 1895; and that this decline was due to\r\ngeneral conditions of panic and depression. In 1895, however, a revival\r\ntook place, and, proceeding with uncertain steps through 1896, became\r\nobvious and important in 1897 and 1898. The average date of failure\r\nfrom 1893–8 of the seven roads described in the text was October 1,\r\n1893, and the average date of reorganization was September 1, 1896.\r\nSince the market price figures quoted are taken one year before failure\r\nand one year after reorganization, conditions in October, 1892, should\r\nbe compared with those in September, 1897. The following diagram traces\r\nthe movements of twenty-six important railroad common stocks between\r\nthose dates. Quotations for none of the seven railroads in question are\r\nincluded.[722]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the prices of the above stocks were not materially\r\nlower on September 1, 1897, than on October 1, 1892. The exact average\r\nwas 73¾ for the earlier month, and 71⅛ for the later. The comparison\r\nmay fairly, however, be carried further than this, and considerable\r\npains have been taken to arrive at general figures which are\r\nconclusive. Such, it is believed, are the following. The market value\r\nof thirty-nine different bond issues of seventeen companies, taken\r\nat random from among those frequently bought and sold upon the New\r\nYork and Philadelphia exchanges, was in October, 1892, $388,628,968.\r\nThis differed little from the market value of the same securities in\r\nSeptember, 1892, which was $388,198,432, or that in November, 1892,\r\nwhich was $390,170,323. The market value of these issues in 1897 was\r\n$371,125,135 in August, $373,875,293 in September, and $372,962,239 in\r\nOctober. Represented in tabular form the situation appears as follows:\r\n\r\n                      _Market Value of Securities_\r\n\r\n           1892                       1897              _Decrease_\r\n\r\n September  $388,198,432     August    $371,125,135    4.4 per cent\r\n October     388,628,968     September  373,875,293    3.7 per cent\r\n November    390,170,323     October    372,962,239    4.4 per cent\r\n\r\nIn other words, the quotations for this large mass of representative\r\nsecurities were within 4½ per cent in 1897 of what they were in 1892.\r\nIf to these are now added the same proportions of stock that existed\r\nfor the disturbed securities of the seven reorganizations from 1893–8\r\nthere appears the following result:\r\n\r\n                      _Market Value of Securities_\r\n\r\n           1892                       1897              _Decrease_\r\n\r\n September  $641,105,160     August    $620,794,202    3.1 per cent\r\n October     644,276,634     September  631,061,329    2.0 per cent\r\n November    644,131,632     October    629,005,577    2.3 per cent[723]\r\n\r\nThis is, as nearly as possible, a computation comparable with figures\r\nalready cited. It is made up the same way, has too broad a basis to\r\ngive a non-typical result, and is not dependent upon the selection\r\nof a single month for its conclusion that security prices had nearly\r\nregained their former level by the last half of 1897. A decrease\r\nin value of 16.2 per cent for the securities of seven reorganized\r\nrailroads has been determined. Less than one-fifth of this can be\r\nattributed to general causes. The significance of the decrease\r\ntherefore remains.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, two other points of interest may be mentioned. First,\r\nthe provision which sound reorganization plans should make for the\r\nfuture development of their properties, and second, the creation\r\nof voting trusts to prevent sudden changes in control. It has been\r\nseen that restrictions on new mortgages have accompanied the issue\r\nof income bonds and of preferred stock, in order to afford to these\r\nlatter a desirable protection. If old bondholders demand these\r\nclauses, a certain amount of new issues is required by the interests\r\nof the corporation. A railroad is never finished. New extensions and\r\nimprovements which shall increase earnings are generally called for\r\nto a degree which current earnings are insufficient to meet. Some\r\nprovision for regular increments of new capital, without the need of\r\nstockholders’ approval in each case, is highly advisable, and implies\r\nno lack of conservatism. In fact, some such provision is often forced\r\nupon a railroad. Take the case of the successive reorganizations of\r\nthe Atchison properties. In 1889 no new bonds were to be allowed to\r\nbe inserted between the income and the mortgage issues, but it was\r\nleft optional with the management to deduct all improvements before\r\nestimating the earnings applicable to dividends on the former bonds.\r\nThis proved quite inadequate, and the reorganization of 1892 provided\r\ndefinitely a fund of $20,000,000 second mortgage bonds, which were to\r\nbe issued to a limit of $5,000,000 each year, for specific improvements\r\non the Atchison, exclusive of the Colorado Midland and the St. Louis\r\n& San Francisco. The right was reserved to the company, when all\r\nthe above should have been used up, to issue more bonds of the same\r\nsort for the same purpose, and on the same mileage up to a limit of\r\n$50,000,000. Finally, in 1895, there were reserved $30,000,000 general\r\nfirst mortgage bonds, to be issued each year to a limit of $3,000,000,\r\nand $20,000,000 adjustment bonds, to be issued each year to a limit\r\nof $2,000,000, after the general mortgage fund should have been\r\nexhausted. In each of the reorganizations in the nineties considered\r\nin this study, in which restrictions on new bond issues were imposed,\r\nthere was concomitant provision for regular increments of mortgage\r\nbonds to be used for improvements, betterments, and new construction.\r\nThus the Baltimore & Ohio in 1898 reserved $5,000,000 prior liens\r\nand $27,000,000 general mortgage bonds, of which the latter were to\r\nbe issued at the rate of not exceeding $1,500,000 for the first four\r\nyears after the organization of the new company, and not exceeding\r\n$1,000,000 a year thereafter; and the former were to be put forth at\r\nthe rate of not exceeding $1,000,000 a year after January 1, 1892, for\r\nenlargements, betterments, and extensions. The Erie in 1895 provided\r\n$5,337,208 in cash to be spent at once, and $17,000,000 in general lien\r\nbonds to be issued during the years following the reorganization. The\r\nNorthern Pacific in 1896 set aside $25,000,000 prior lien bonds, of\r\nwhich not more than $1,500,000 were to be issued in any one year, and\r\n$4,000,000 general lien bonds, presumably to be used as needed. The\r\nReading in 1895 reserved $20,000,000 general mortgage bonds for new\r\nconstruction, additions, and betterments, of which not over $1,500,000\r\nwere to be used in any one year. And, finally, the Richmond Terminal\r\nreserved $20,000,000 in 5 per cent bonds to be used at the rate of\r\n$2,000,000 per year, and has recently authorized a $200,000,000 4 per\r\ncent mortgage which will raise the yearly limit of expenditure to\r\n$5,000,000.[724]\r\n\r\nBefore the nineties, as after, provision for new capital accompanied\r\nrestriction on the future issue of bonds. In 1886 the Reading provided\r\na lump sum of $9,792,000 general mortgage bonds for future use in\r\nthe improvement of the railroad; and in 1875 the Northern Pacific\r\ncontemplated the issue of first mortgage bonds to an average of $25,000\r\nper mile of new road actually completed. Where, as with the Atchison in\r\n1889, some such provision did not accompany the general restrictions\r\nplaced upon new bond issues, or where, as with the Northern Pacific in\r\n1875, the provision proved inadequate, fresh measures of relief were\r\ncompelled. The Atchison reorganization of 1892 has been mentioned; in\r\n1889 a financial operation of the Northern Pacific, which according to\r\nour definition was not properly a reorganization, provided $20,000,000\r\n5 per cent consolidated mortgage bonds for additional branches at a\r\nrate not to exceed $30,000 per mile, and a like sum for betterments,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nEven where no restrictions on future bond issues are imposed, it is\r\nhighly advisable that some provision for future capital requirements\r\nbe made, and that the management have at its disposal a fund of bonds\r\nissuable without the approval of stockholders in each case. It is\r\nprobable, therefore, that some such provision would have been a feature\r\nof some, at least, of the reorganizations even had the restrictions\r\ndescribed not made the clauses an imperative necessity; but if we may\r\njudge from the rather restricted basis on which we are here at work,\r\nthe provisions would have been far less liberal than we have found to\r\nbe the case. In 1895 the Union Pacific set aside $13,000,000 4 per\r\ncent bonds and $7,000,000 preferred stock to dispose of equipment\r\nobligations, and for reorganization and corporate uses. Of these,\r\ncorporate uses were stated to be those which would be proper to the\r\ncorporation thereafter, such as the issue of securities in extension\r\nof the property. This, of course, was quite inadequate. Similarly the\r\nRock Island in 1902 and the Erie in 1875–7 provided for a certain issue\r\nof stock or bonds to be applied to future capital requirements. It is\r\nundoubtedly true that both the Erie and the Reading railroads were\r\nhampered by the lack of adequate provision of this nature; though as\r\nthe main difficulty of each corporation was the continued existence\r\nof heavier charges than it could bear, an automatic increase of\r\nindebtedness would not have proved a solution of their troubles.\r\n\r\nThe essence of a voting trust is the deposit of stock in the hands\r\nof trustees (most frequently five in number). These trustees issue\r\ncertificates in return. All dividends declared on the stock are paid\r\nover to holders of certificates, but all the voting power is exercised\r\nby the trustees so long as the trust endures. Of the reorganizations\r\nwhich we have described, ten reorganizations with foreclosure included\r\nfive voting trusts and one proxy committee; eight reorganizations\r\nwithout foreclosure included two voting trusts; ten reorganizations\r\nbefore 1893 included two voting trusts (though a third was proposed\r\nfor the Atchison in 1889); seven reorganizations in 1893–8 included\r\nfive voting trusts and one proxy committee. The use of voting trusts\r\nhas therefore become more general, denoting a realization of the\r\ndangers of fluctuating and speculative control at critical periods in a\r\nrailroad’s history. This desire to secure conditions of stable control\r\nhas been the dominant one in the cases under consideration. “In order\r\nto establish such control of the reorganized company for a series of\r\nyears,” said the reorganization plan of the Baltimore & Ohio in 1898,\r\n“both classes of stock of the new company shall be vested in ... five\r\nvoting trustees.” “The importance of vesting in the present creditor\r\nclass the management of the properties until their productiveness\r\nis considerably increased ... is manifest,” said the syndicate\r\nreorganization plan of the Reading in 1886. It is of supreme importance\r\nthat a reorganized company be well started on its way by men who have\r\nan interest in making the reorganization plan permanently successful,\r\nand that conservative direction be assured until danger of bankruptcy\r\nbe past. For this reason we should expect the use of voting trusts to\r\nincrease in direct relation to the seriousness of the difficulties\r\nexperienced, and to the vividness with which the need for stability is\r\nfelt. If we may generalize, and say that a railroad which cannot be\r\nreorganized without a foreclosure sale is usually in more desperate\r\nstraits than one which can be saved by voluntary concessions, we have\r\nan explanation of the coincidence of foreclosures and voting trusts.\r\nThe teachings of experience, which have shown both the usefulness of\r\nvoting trusts as tools, and the necessity of a solution such as they\r\noffer, further explain the increased prominence of the trust in later\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIt is not true that voting trusts are always used for the purposes\r\nindicated. In 1892 certain stockholders of the Baltimore & Ohio agreed\r\nto deposit their certificates in a trust for one year and five months.\r\nThe stock deposited amounted to $8,975,000 out of a total outstanding\r\nof $25,000,000, and a limit of $11,000,000 was set to the amount to be\r\nso placed, the object of the arrangement apparently being to increase\r\nthe influence of the stockholders concerned by concentration of their\r\nholdings.[725] Again, in 1895, to take an outside example, the stock\r\nof the Oregon Railway & Navigation Company was placed in trust with\r\nthe Central Trust Company in order better to protect the preferred\r\nstock. It was provided that during the continuance of the trust the\r\nCentral Trust Company should vote all the stock: first, against any\r\nincrease in the preferred stock unless the holders of all the voting\r\ntrust certificates of both classes should give their unanimous consent\r\nat general meetings; second, against all propositions relating to the\r\nmortgaging, selling, or leasing of the railroad and telegraph lines\r\nof the company, or to the consolidation thereof, unless a majority\r\nof each class of certificates should consent; third, on all other\r\nquestions as directed by the holders of a majority of the aggregate\r\nof all voting trust certificates of both classes represented at\r\ngeneral meetings.[726] Further provisions gave to the preferred stock\r\ncontrol of a majority of the board of directors. These instances are\r\nof interest; but the principal purpose of the voting trusts in the\r\nreorganizations which we have considered has been nevertheless the\r\nsecuring of stability of control for a definite period after the\r\nrehabilitation of the bankrupt companies.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the voting trust varies from company to company. The\r\nmost usual provision is for five years. Frequently the voting trustees\r\nmay terminate the trust earlier at their discretion, as in the case\r\nof the Baltimore & Ohio trust of 1898, the Richmond Terminal trust of\r\n1894, or the Northern Pacific trust of 1896. Frequently, also, certain\r\nconditions must be fulfilled before termination. In the case of the\r\nErie in 1895 no stock certificates were to be due or deliverable\r\nbefore December 1, 1900, nor until the expiration of such further\r\nperiod, if any, as should elapse before the Erie Railroad Company\r\nin one year should have paid 4 per cent cash dividend on the first\r\npreferred stock.[727] In the case of the Reading in 1896 4 per cent\r\ncash dividends on the first preferred stock were required for two\r\nconsecutive years, and this delayed dissolution three years beyond the\r\ntime originally contemplated.[728] The Richmond Terminal trust had\r\nprovisions similar to those of the Erie.\r\n\r\nThe number of trustees also varies. The scheme proposed for the\r\nAtchison in 1889 contemplated a trust of seven; the Baltimore & Ohio\r\nin 1898 and the Richmond Terminal in 1894 provided for five; and the\r\nErie in 1896 for three; but this point is not material. When the\r\nreorganization plan requires the consent of stockholders to an increase\r\nin the issue of securities the consent of holders of trust certificates\r\nis apt to be required on similar occasions during the existence of the\r\ntrust. Thus the Northern Pacific agreement of 1896 forbade the trustees\r\nto increase the preferred stock or to issue any new mortgage, except\r\nwith the consent of the holders of a majority of the whole amount of\r\npreferred stock trust certificates, and of the holders of a majority of\r\nthe common stock trust certificates represented at the meeting.\r\n\r\nThis ends the present treatment of the subject of railroad\r\nreorganization. The results of the discussion may be briefly summed up\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n_First._ Reorganization is most frequently an attempt to extricate an\r\nembarrassed company from its difficulties.\r\n\r\n_Second._ These difficulties can generally be traced either to an\r\nunrestricted freedom of capitalization, or to destructive competition.\r\n\r\n_Third._ The shape in which trouble appears is likely to be that of a\r\nlarge floating debt or of excessive fixed charges; either or both of\r\nwhich may have brought the corporation to a critical condition some\r\ntime before the actual collapse.\r\n\r\n_Fourth._ The best practice favors the retirement of floating debt\r\nby assessments on securityholders, though sales of securities are\r\nsometimes resorted to, or a combination of sales and assessments is\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n_Fifth._ Fixed charges are composed chiefly of interest and rentals.\r\nInterest payments are reduced by the retirement of outstanding bonds by\r\nnew bonds which bear a lower rate of interest, or by income bonds or\r\nstock, or by a combination of securities with a fixed rate of interest\r\nwith securities upon which payment of interest is optional. Rentals may\r\nbe reduced by direct negotiation, or the leased roads may be absorbed\r\ninto the main system, and their securityholders receive new stocks and\r\nbonds as above.\r\n\r\n_Sixth._ The new bonds are of fewer kinds and have longer terms to run\r\nthan the bonds which they displace.\r\n\r\n_Seventh._ This reduction in fixed charges imposes a loss on the\r\ngreater part of securityholders, both in respect to the annual interest\r\nwhich they can claim, and in respect to the selling price of their\r\nholdings. A similar loss is suffered by those securityholders who pay\r\nthe required assessments.\r\n\r\n_Eighth._ The loss falls on securityholders according to the seniority\r\nof their holdings,—those bonds escaping which can expect to satisfy\r\ntheir claims from the selling price of the railroad at foreclosure sale.\r\n\r\n_Ninth._ The most important development in reorganization practice\r\nhas been the increasing use of new securities bearing a fixed rate\r\nof interest with new securities bearing a conditional rate of\r\ninterest; a use which may make the losses of junior securityholders\r\ntemporary instead of permanent, and yet safeguard the interests of\r\nthe corporation. In this connection preferred stock has gained in\r\npopularity over income bonds.\r\n\r\n_Tenth._ This development, and the issue of new securities for floating\r\ndebt and for other purposes, have caused the capitalization after\r\nreorganization in all but one of the cases which we have examined to\r\nexceed the capitalization before.\r\n\r\n_Eleventh._ In order to perfect a reorganization additional provisions\r\nare often inserted, which protect junior securityholders against the\r\nreckless issue of new bonds, supply the corporation with ability\r\nto make necessary betterments from capital account, protect the\r\ncorporation from sudden changes in control, and similarly supplement\r\nthe main clauses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation about railroad reorganization must be gathered from a wide\r\nvariety of sources. The most important are five in number. First,\r\nthere are the annual reports of the railroads themselves. Second,\r\nthere are the files of financial and railroad papers. Third, there are\r\ncontemporaneous pamphlets. Fourth, there are memoirs and biographies\r\ncontaining first-hand material. And fifth, there are government\r\ndocuments, which comprise (1) regular reports by and testimony before\r\nbodies like the state and national railway commissions; (2) reports\r\nby and testimony taken before occasional committees; (3) legislative\r\nrecords; (4) state and federal court proceedings.\r\n\r\nOf the five sources mentioned, the files of contemporary papers are the\r\nmost useful. The _Commercial and Financial Chronicle_, the _Railroad\r\nGazette_, the _Railway Age_, the _Railway and Engineering Review_,\r\nthe _Railway Times_ of London, the New York _Tribune_, the New York\r\n_Journal of Commerce_, the _Wall Street Journal_, and many others are\r\ngenerally accurate and trustworthy, though it should be noted as a\r\nlimitation that they seldom have inside information, and that their\r\ncomment is not always independent. These papers are supplemented by\r\npamphlets and circulars. Many reorganization plans are published in\r\npamphlet form. Opposition to them is not infrequently thrown into the\r\nsame shape. Reports of experts are printed in pamphlets. In general,\r\nthe live literature of reorganization must be put out on short notice,\r\nand so is issued in this informal way. The official statistics of\r\nrailroads are to be found in the reports of the railroad companies\r\nthemselves, made to stockholders or to supervisory government bodies.\r\nThese statistics, like the news items in the financial and railroad\r\npapers, must be used with care. They are sometimes incomplete, and\r\nthey are sometimes purposely misleading. Nevertheless, they are\r\nuseful, and serious inaccuracies in any of them are usually exposed\r\nwithin a few years after their original publication. The material\r\nto be found in legislative records is not abundant. Railroads\r\nalmost invariably, however, appear before the courts in the course\r\nof their reorganizations, and in the decisions of these tribunals\r\nsome facts of interest may be found. The records of the receivership\r\nof the Union Pacific have been published in fourteen volumes. The\r\ndecision of the United States Supreme Court in Pearsall _vs._ Great\r\nNorthern[729] blocked the first of the reorganization plans proposed\r\nfor the Northern Pacific in 1895. An earlier decision[730] enabled\r\nthe Union Pacific to postpone the payment of interest upon the public\r\ndebt until the principal should have fallen due. The Erie has been\r\nat times almost continuously before the courts, and the same is true\r\nof the Reading during its reorganizations, of the Northern Pacific,\r\nand of other roads. The student is most fortunate when he can uncover\r\ntestimony before government committees, of men who have taken part\r\nin reorganization proceedings, or who are personally acquainted with\r\ndevelopments which have led up to railroad failures. Mr. Blanchard,\r\nbefore the Hepburn Committee,[731] and Mr. Fink, before the Hepburn\r\nand the Cullom Committees,[732] helped their hearers to understand the\r\npolicy which finally resulted in the failure of the Baltimore & Ohio.\r\nThe report of the Poland Committee disclosed the scandal of the Crédit\r\nMobilier.[733] The testimony of Gould, Adams, Ames, Holmes, and others\r\nbefore the United States Pacific Railroad Commission of 1887–88[734]\r\nmade clear the iniquity of the Union Pacific reorganization of 1880.\r\nThe statements of Mr. Pierce before the Senate Committee on Pacific\r\nRailroads in 1896[735] explained the attitude of the Union Pacific\r\ntowards the repayment of that company’s debt to the Government. The\r\ntestimony of Messrs. McLeod, Rice, Harris, and others before the\r\nIndustrial Commission of 1900 threw much light upon the Reading\r\nbankruptcy of 1893. The arguments of counsel in the matter of export\r\ndifferentials, reprinted in the fifth volume of the Elkins Committee\r\nreport,[736] gave valuable information on the subject of trunk-line\r\ncompetition. Many of the witnesses before these committees are frank\r\nin criticism of the railroads with which they have been connected.\r\nOthers are forced to admissions by the keen questioning to which they\r\nare exposed. The only similar material to be found elsewhere lies in\r\nmemoirs, such as those of Henry Villard,[737] or in biographies like\r\nOberholtzer’s Life of Jay Cooke[738] and Pearson’s An American Railroad\r\nBuilder[739] which make use of private papers of men prominent in\r\nrailroad finance. Perhaps White’s Book of Daniel Drew,[740] Depew’s\r\nRetrospect of Twenty-Five Years,[741] and the Life of Isaac Ingalls\r\nStevens by his son,[742] should be included in this class.\r\n\r\nThis enumeration, while in no way exhaustive, indicates the principal\r\nsources from which material may be obtained. Secondary works do not\r\nexist which treat solely of railroad reorganization. There is an\r\narticle by E. S. Meade in the _Annals_ of the American Academy,[743]\r\narticles by Simon Sterne in the _Forum_,[744] and an article by\r\nA. Lansburgh in _Die Bank_,[745] but no books of which the author\r\nis aware. Mention may be made of an intelligent discussion of an\r\nindustrial reorganization by A. S. Dewing in the _Quarterly Journal of\r\nEconomics_.[746] _Poor’s Manual_ for 1900 contains the most convenient\r\nset of general statistics. On railroad receiverships, besides legal\r\nworks, there is a monograph by H. H. Swain,[747] which has a brief\r\nbibliography, and articles in the _Forum_, _North American Review_, and\r\nother periodicals.\r\n\r\nOn the history of the great American railroad systems the literature\r\nis also quite inadequate. The Union Pacific has been written up\r\nfrequently, because of its relations with the United States\r\nGovernment. Works by Davis,[748] von der Leyen,[749] Bromley,[750]\r\nDillon,[751] Crawford,[752] Hazard,[753] and White[754] treat various\r\nphases of the company’s development up to its final reorganization, an\r\narticle by Meyer[755] describes the settlements between the Pacific\r\nrailroads and the Government, and another article by Mitchell in the\r\n_Quarterly Journal of Economics_[756] deals with Union Pacific finance\r\nsince that time. There may also be mentioned an account by Bailey,[757]\r\nwhich covers the whole of the road’s history, but in a superficial\r\nway, and a vicious attack by Robinson upon all the government-aided\r\nlines.[758] The student of the Erie has at his disposal the elaborate\r\nnarrative by E. H. Mott,[759] the chapters by Charles Francis Adams,\r\nJr.,[760] and the sketch by Crouch.[761] Milton Reizenstein has\r\ndealt with the progress of the Baltimore and Ohio up to 1853,[762]\r\nand for this road there is material to be found in Smith’s Book of\r\nthe Great Railway Celebrations of 1857,[763] and in a compilation\r\nof the Laws, Ordinances, and Documents Relating to the Baltimore and\r\nOhio Railroad, published in 1840.[764] For the Northern Pacific the\r\nhistory by Smalley covers in popular style the period from 1864 to\r\n1883,[765] the careful History of the Northern Securities Case, by\r\nB. H. Meyer, treats of an interesting later development,[766] chapters\r\nin von der Leyen’s book contain acute and independent discussions\r\nof Northern Pacific as well as of Union Pacific finance,[767] and\r\nthere is a fifteen-page pamphlet by Chapman entitled The Northern\r\nPacific Railroad.[768] Schlagintweit in 1884 described his travels\r\non the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific.[769] Wilson has written two\r\nvolumes upon the Pennsylvania Railroad,[770] while Worthington[771]\r\nand Bishop[772] have described the internal improvements undertaken\r\nby the state of Pennsylvania. Ackerman is the author of a Historical\r\nSketch of the Illinois Central Railroad,[773] and Hollander[774]\r\nand Ferguson[775] of works on the Cincinnati Southern. Potts[776]\r\nand Briscoe[777] have written on railroads in Texas. The Chicago &\r\nNorthwestern has published a volume called Yesterday and To-day,[778]\r\nwhich contains some information. Hinsdale has worked up the History\r\nof the Long Island Railroad.[779] Bishop has sketched the history\r\nof the St. Paul & Sioux City Railroad.[780] Bliss is the author\r\nof a Historical Memoir of the Western Railroad.[781] Cary in 1893\r\ndescribed the Organization and History of the Chicago, Milwaukee\r\n& St. Paul Railroad Company.[782] Phillips discusses in excellent\r\nfashion the early history of a number of Southern carriers.[783] The\r\nautobiography of George Francis Train[784] and Smyth’s biography of\r\nHenry Bradley Plant[785] are serviceable. Works like those of Van\r\nOss,[786] Snyder,[787] Carter,[788] and Spearman,[789] and brief\r\ndescriptions which have appeared in the columns of the _Railway\r\nWorld_ and in _Moody’s Magazine_, treat of a number of railroads, but\r\nmake no attempt at a scholarly examination of any one. Some general\r\nworks like Ringwalt’s Development of Transportation Systems,[790]\r\nAdams’ Railroads: Their Origin and Problems,[791] Hadley’s Railroad\r\nTransportation,[792] Kupka’s Die Verkehrsmittel in den Vereinigten\r\nStaaten von Nordamerika,[793] Singer’s Die Amerikanischen Bahnen,[794]\r\nMyers’ History of the Great American Fortunes,[795] Bancroft’s History\r\nof the Pacific States,[796] and Chronicles of the Builders,[797]\r\nDavidson and Stuvé’s Complete History of Illinois,[798] Hollander’s\r\nFinancial History of Baltimore,[799] Sanborn’s Congressional Grants\r\nof Land in Aid of Railways,[800] Haney’s Congressional History of\r\nRailways,[801] and Million’s State Aid to Railways in Missouri,[802]\r\ncontain incidental information about individual railroads.\r\n\r\nThese books are of service. Their number is, however, small and their\r\nscope limited. It is surprising that a field so rich as that of the\r\nhistory of American railroad systems should have attracted so little\r\nattention from competent students. It is not too much to say that the\r\nhistory of the Erie by Mott is the only comprehensive work of the kind\r\nwhich our literature possesses, and that is already thirteen years\r\nold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Milton Reizenstein, The Economic History of the Baltimore & Ohio\r\nRailroad, Johns Hopkins University Studies, July-August, 1897.\r\n\r\n[2] Reizenstein estimates the original cost of the first 379 miles to\r\nhave been $37,612 per mile, and, adding the cost of reconstruction and\r\nextension to 1853, he gets a figure of $41,237 per mile.

See\r\nalso Chron. 20:547, 1875.\r\n\r\n[6] The Baltimore & Ohio had no line to New York. The Pennsylvania had\r\nhad one since 1873, and over it Mr. Garrett was forced to send all\r\nhis New York business. Disputes arose over the proper pro-rating of\r\ncharges. President Garrett alleged that the terminal charge of four\r\ncents per 100 pounds which the Pennsylvania Company imposed on freight\r\ncoming to or going from New York was exorbitant, and that he was paying\r\nfor 100 miles of transportation when the real distance was only 90.\r\nPresident Scott replied that the rates for terminal services in New\r\nYork were not sufficient to cover the cost of doing the business, and\r\nthat the Pennsylvania’s New York and Philadelphia line was open to the\r\nBaltimore & Ohio on the same terms as to all others. R. R. Gaz. 7:71–2,\r\n1875.\r\n\r\n[7] R. R. Gaz. 6:8, 1874. The outcome was an agreement whereby the\r\nBaltimore & Ohio restored rates and fares, and the Pennsylvania\r\nagreed to haul two of the former’s trains daily each way between West\r\nPhiladelphia and Jersey City, to sell through tickets West over the\r\nBaltimore & Ohio, and to give that road all necessary facilities for\r\nthe handling of through freight.\r\n\r\n[8] Sugar, coffee, salt, etc.\r\n\r\n[9] The traffic between Cumberland and Baltimore was mostly coal.\r\nIn an interview the last of May or first of June, 1875, President\r\nGarrett said that as soon as the right was conceded to his road to\r\nenter New York over the Pennsylvania Railroad as he had been doing\r\nfor thirty years, and to make such rates from Baltimore and Chicago\r\nas he chose, he was ready for peace and not sooner.... The Saratoga\r\ncombination, which had been gotten up to ruin the Baltimore & Ohio\r\nRailroad, had only served to establish the road and give it a standing\r\nin the West.... It had been and was now his firm object to maintain\r\nthe freight rate on fourth class, the principal freight shipped from\r\nthe West, at 35 cents per 100. This was a reasonable rate and gave his\r\ncompany a fair profit. The other lines had to submit to this rate or\r\nthere could be no peace. R. R. Gaz. 7:237, 1875.\r\n\r\n[10] R. R. Gaz. 7:261, 1875; Ibid. 7:270, 1875; Ibid. 7:289, 1875;\r\nChron. 20:593, 1875. The compact was to last for ten years, the\r\ncompanies to agree upon and to maintain moderate rates between all\r\ncompeting points. Each board of directors was to appoint a special\r\ncommittee to which was to be referred all differences which might\r\narise. The Pennsylvania opened its lines to the Baltimore & Ohio\r\nbetween Philadelphia and New York on the same terms that it gave other\r\nconnecting roads at Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n[11] See Interstate Commerce Commission, Railways in the United States\r\nin 1902, part 2, entitled, “A Forty-year Review of Changes in Freight\r\nTariff,” p. 79.\r\n\r\n[12] For an account of the differentials at different times see\r\nthe argument of counsel and the opinion of the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission, “In the Matter of Differential Rates to and from North\r\nAtlantic Ports,” April 27, 1905, in Elkins Committee Report, vol. 5,\r\nAppendix E.

Speaking from the standpoint of an impartial observer, Mr. Fink\r\ndeclared that $1,840,494 had been lost between December 19, 1878, and\r\nMay 1, 1879, through the failure of the Michigan Central, Lake Shore,\r\nPennsylvania, and Baltimore & Ohio and their connections to observe\r\ntheir published tariffs. Chron. 28:578, 1879.\r\n\r\n[15] By agreement of March 11, 1881, the chairman of the Joint\r\nExecutive Committee, Mr. Fink, was given authority to proclaim a\r\ngeneral reduction in published rates when it should be shown that any\r\npool line had been accepting traffic at less than the regular rate.\r\nThis authority he exercised in April. Rates were restored almost\r\nimmediately by special action of the Joint Executive Committee, only to\r\nbe reduced again in June for similar reasons.\r\n\r\n[16] The actual outbreak of the war was due to the conviction of the\r\nNew York Central that traffic was being diverted to other roads by\r\nsecret departures from the published tariff.

A\r\npassenger rate war between the Pennsylvania and the Baltimore & Ohio\r\ntook place early in 1886, and resulted in the indirect cutting by the\r\nformer of the pool rate which it had agreed to maintain. Chron. 42:73,\r\n1886.\r\n\r\n[34] From $34,713,696 in 1884 to $56,868,201 in 1887.\r\n\r\n[35] Such as connecting lines, iron bridges over the Ohio River,\r\nelevators, wharves, terminal facilities, etc.\r\n\r\n[36] The lowest average price of the common stock before announcement\r\nof the measures taken for relief was 160, from which point the\r\nquotations rapidly dropped to 125, and on January 5, 1889, to 85.\r\n\r\n[37] Chron. 45:304, 1887; Ibid. 45:824, 1887.\r\n\r\n[38] About $5,000,000 of the floating debt in March, 1888, consisted of\r\nadvances by the syndicate, for which they held 50,000 shares of Western\r\nUnion Telegraph Company stock, and 15,000 shares of United States\r\nExpress Company stock, which at current prices about covered their\r\nloan. Statement of President Spencer, Chron. 46:344, 1888.\r\n\r\n[39] Ry. Age, 12:640, 1887.\r\n\r\n[40] “If it [the stock] is sold,” said a statement in the New York\r\n_Tribune_, purporting to represent the views of Senator Gorman, a large\r\nstockholder, “it will place the control of the road practically in\r\nthe hands of the syndicate.... It is clearly preferable to keep the\r\ncontrol of the stock here [Baltimore], as the road is a city and state\r\ninstitution of the first importance to our business interests.” Ry.\r\nAge, 13:44, 1888. Another objection was that an issue of additional\r\npreferred stock would postpone indefinitely dividends upon the common.\r\n\r\n[41] Mr. Spencer had succeeded Robert Garrett in December, 1887.\r\n\r\n[42] Chron. 46:319, 1888. In connection with this proposition President\r\nSpencer made the following statement: Of the $11,148,007 floating\r\ndebt, December, 1887, $7,769,314 consisted of loans and bills payable.\r\nThis is now reduced to $6,446,173. There will probably be added to\r\nthis $1,400,000 for equipment, already either under contract or to be\r\nconstructed in the company’s shops. In addition there should be, in\r\nthe near future, not less than $2,000,000 additional put into this\r\nproperty for the purpose of improvement. The total requirements are\r\nthus $10,000,000. Of this $5,000,000 will be disposed of by assets\r\nin the hands of the syndicate as collateral, or in the hands of the\r\ncompany. Of the remaining $5,000,000, $1,500,000 is floating debt. This\r\nwill be more than provided for by the $2,500,000 of consolidated bonds\r\nremaining in the hands of the company for its future use after the sale\r\nof the $5,000,000 to the syndicate. The remaining $3,500,000 needed for\r\nequipment and improvements it is the desire of the company to provide\r\nfor by that portion of the $2,500,000 not required for the floating\r\ndebt, and by the $2,500,000 in the sinking-fund loan of 1890.

The amiability of the syndicate was\r\nprofitable to it. On May 21 the subscription books of the $7,500,000\r\nmortgage were opened in London and New York, and the whole issue was\r\nsubscribed in London before the inhabitants of the American city, in\r\nspite of their proverbial alertness, were out of bed. In September,\r\n1888, the Baltimore & Ohio was reported as “having all the funds needed\r\nfor the present.” R. R. Gaz. 20:343, 1888.\r\n\r\n[47] Ry.

The coincidence was so\r\nsuggestive that it was thought necessary to “credibly inform” certain\r\nbankers that the investigating committee was expected to continue its\r\ninvestigation and to make a full report. In December the committee\r\nwas instructed by a directors’ resolution not to report till its full\r\nstatement was ready, and further notice does not appear.\r\n\r\n[50] Ry. Age, 16:882, 1891. At the same time the directors decided to\r\nsell $5,096,600 additional common stock to meet expenditures which\r\nwould be necessary in connection with the World’s Fair at Chicago.\r\n\r\n[51] Chron. 47:575, 1888. It is impossible to give an adequate account\r\nof these wars without straying too far from our subject. Some of the\r\nmethods by which rebates were granted are revealed in the case of Jacob\r\nShamberg _v._ Del., Lack. & W. R. R. Co. _et al._, 4 I. C. C. Rep.\r\n630. The differential question took on a new phase in 1888 through the\r\ndemand of weaker roads for protection against stronger. This had long\r\nbeen a demand of the Grand Trunk, and had been conceded to it in the\r\nlast part of 1887. In January, 1888, the Pennsylvania and the New York\r\nCentral agreed to allow besides a differential rate to the Erie, the\r\nLackawanna, the West Shore, and the Baltimore & Ohio, which should vary\r\nfrom five cents per hundred pounds from Chicago to New York on first\r\nclass to one cent on fifth and sixth classes. R. R. Gaz. 20:26, 1888;\r\nChron. 46:57, 1888. This did not prevent active warfare throughout the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n[52] Known as the Presidents’ and Bankers’ Agreement.\r\n\r\n[53] There was, however, a shortage in the wheat crop in 1888.\r\n\r\n[54] The comparative peace of 1889 was due as much to the abundance\r\nof traffic offering as to the efficacy of the agreement concluded in\r\nFebruary of that year. According to the Chronicle the apportionment\r\nof traffic then contemplated proved difficult to carry out, and\r\nconsiderable discontent arose. Chron. 50:892, 1890.\r\n\r\n[55] In 1890 difficulties occurred through the competition of the\r\nCanadian Pacific, and more particularly through the attempt of the Lake\r\nShore to reduce the differential formerly granted to the Grand Trunk.\r\nChron. 50:850, 1890. The matter was left to arbitration, Chron. 51:625,\r\nwith the result that the lines north of Lake Ontario were allowed to\r\ncharge two and one-half cents less per hundred pounds on dressed beef\r\nto the seaboard than the lines further south. R. R. Gaz. 23:64, 1891.\r\nThis had the effect of putting the Canadian Pacific on an equality with\r\nthe Grand Trunk. Late in 1892 still another agreement between the trunk\r\nlines was found necessary to maintain rates. Chron. 55:857, 1892.\r\n\r\n[56] Ry.

The most important had been those of the Pittsburgh\r\n& Western in 1891, Chron. 52:238, 1891, the Akron & Chicago Junction,\r\nChron. 53:756, 1891, and the West Virginia & Pittsburgh, Chron.\r\n54:725, 1892. In 1893 the Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern and the Ohio\r\n& Mississippi Railway companies consolidated, and the Baltimore &\r\nOhio guaranteed the principal and interest of the first consolidated\r\nmortgage gold bonds of the consolidated company for $25,000,000. Chron.\r\n56:332, 1893.\r\n\r\n[60] Chron. 59:696, 1894. In October, 1893, the Baltimore & Ohio was\r\nborrowing in London on one year 5 per cent promissory notes, and 2\r\nper cent commission, paying, therefore, an equivalent of 7 per cent\r\ninterest. Ry. Times, 64:499, 1893.\r\n\r\n[61] Chron. 60:42, 1895.\r\n\r\n[62] In 1895 the directors speak of the unremunerative rates\r\nprevailing. Chron. 60:711, 1895. At the end of the year Mr. Alexander\r\nShaw, chairman of the board of directors, felt called upon to say,\r\n“The two subjects which are giving the new board of directors the most\r\nto think about are the floating debt and the future management of the\r\nproperty. We have to fund the former, and as to the latter there is\r\na difference of opinion among the directors.... I deny specifically\r\nthat the January interest on the bonds of the company will be passed;\r\nthat a receivership, either friendly or otherwise, is contemplated;\r\nthat the Baltimore & Ohio and the Southern Railway systems are to be\r\nconsolidated; and the statements that there has been an irregularity in\r\nthe manner of keeping the books of the company.” Chron. 61:1153, 1895.\r\n\r\n[63] Ry.

The status of the Baltimore & Ohio stock was\r\nsomewhat peculiar, in that when first issued to the state of Maryland\r\nit had been accompanied by a guarantee, or conditional guarantee, of\r\ndividend payments; and Johns Hopkins University, to which the stock\r\nhad been transferred, maintained that this contract, added to the\r\ncontinuous payment of dividends for over fifty years, gave them rights\r\neven against the bondholders.\r\n\r\n[71] Chron. 66:1235, 1898.\r\n\r\n[72] The prior lien bonds were “to be secured by a mortgage upon the\r\nmain line and branches, Parkersburg Branch and Pittsburg Division when\r\nacquired by the new company, covering about 1017 miles of first track,\r\nand about 964 miles of second, third, and fourth track and sidings, and\r\nalso all the equipment now owned by the company of the value of upward\r\nof $20,000,000, or hereafter acquired in any manner by the use of the\r\n$34,000,000 reserved first mortgage bonds, as hereinafter stated.”\r\n\r\n[73] The first mortgage 4s were to be a first lien “upon the\r\nPhiladelphia, Chicago, and Akron divisions and branches and the\r\nFairmount, Morgantown & Pittsburg Railroad, covering about 570 miles\r\nof first track, and about 332 miles of second, third, and fourth track\r\nand sidings, and also on the properties now included in the present\r\nBaltimore & Ohio Terminal mortgages of 1894, when said lines and\r\nproperties are acquired by the new company; also on the Baltimore Belt\r\nRailroad, if and when the same shall be acquired by the new company.\r\nThey will also be a lien subject to the prior lien mortgage upon the\r\nlines, properties, and equipment covered by the latter.”\r\n\r\n[74] Annual Yield of Old and New Securities:\r\n\r\n                                                        _Annual return\r\n                           _Previous   _Annual return     from new\r\n                             annual       from new        bonds and\r\n          _Loan_             return_     bonds given_    stock given_\r\n\r\n  B. & O.

At\r\nthis price the yield would have been $3,420,000; so evidently very\r\nlittle other stock was sold.\r\n\r\n[77] In fact they were never quite so low as this.\r\n\r\n[78] Chron. 69:128, 1899.\r\n\r\n[79] Chron. 67:27, 1898.\r\n\r\n[80] Ry.

The interest of the Baltimore & Ohio in the Reading dated\r\nfrom 1902, and was influenced in turn by the ability of the Reading\r\nto control the Central of New Jersey, over which the Baltimore & Ohio\r\nreached New York. The latter’s holdings of Reading stock were shared\r\nwith the Vanderbilts. Both the Baltimore & Ohio and the Lake Shore sold\r\na block of their Reading stock in 1904.\r\n\r\n[86] See statement by the Pennsylvania management in Chron. 83:563,\r\n1906.\r\n\r\n[87] It is not necessary to do more than to mention the recent contest\r\nbetween the Baltimore & Ohio and the Hill-Morgan people over the\r\nChicago Terminal Transfer Railway. By arrangement with this company\r\nthe Baltimore & Ohio had enjoyed terminal facilities at Chicago on\r\nfavorable terms. When the Terminal Railway went bankrupt the Baltimore\r\n& Ohio paid off the first mortgage bonds in order to prevent the loss\r\nof its privileges. Litigation followed, to end finally in an agreement\r\nbetween the Hill and Baltimore & Ohio interests for joint ownership\r\nof the Chicago Terminal by the Burlington and the latter, and for the\r\nuse of its facilities in accordance with an equitable division of its\r\ntrackage. The Pere Marquette and the Chicago Great Western, which had\r\nshared in the use of the property to that time, were left to shift for\r\nthemselves. Ry. World, August 23, 1907.\r\n\r\n[88] E. H.

Of this rate 6 per cent covered the interest and 1 per cent,\r\nby continuous reinvestment at 6 per cent, was expected to yield the\r\nprincipal sum in the 34 years agreed upon. Annual Report, 1867. Like\r\nmost new companies, the Richmond & Danville found difficulty at first\r\nin meeting its obligations, and was obliged to issue bonds to provide\r\nfor overdue interest to the state and to keep its floating debt within\r\nbounds.

This road stretched from Goldsboro in\r\nthe eastern part of North Carolina to Charlotte in the southwestern\r\npart, via Greensboro. It was principally owned by the state of North\r\nCarolina. By the terms of the lease the Richmond & Danville agreed to\r\npay $260,000 per annum for thirty years.\r\n\r\n[288] The whole road was opened for traffic in September, 1873. It\r\nwent into the hands of a receiver in 1874, and was sold in foreclosure\r\nin 1876; but the Pennsylvania Railroad relieved the Richmond &\r\nDanville from all collateral liabilities incurred on its account.

At a meeting in May, 1877, it was pointed\r\nout to them that the net earnings of the road had not been enough to\r\npay the interest on its bonds, and that a large amount was due to the\r\nstate of Tennessee which the company had no present means of paying.\r\nEither an assessment on the stock or a lease to the East Tennessee\r\nwas declared to be necessary. Accordingly, a lease was concluded. The\r\nEast Tennessee agreed so to discharge the principal of the company’s\r\nindebtedness to the state as to reduce the annual interest account from\r\n$360,000 to $310,000 as a maximum, and upon the fulfilment of this and\r\nof certain other minor conditions took over the operation of the road.\r\nTwo years later the lease was extended for twenty years at a definite\r\nrental amounting to 7 per cent on $4,225,000 or a yearly payment of\r\n$295,750.

The Georgia Southern cost $367,369.\r\nOutstanding debts were assumed. To provide for these and other outlays\r\n$10,000,000 new 5 per cent bonds were authorized. R. R. Gaz. 12:622,\r\n1880.\r\n\r\n[298] This line was completed in 1882. Chron. 35:430, 1882; R. R. Gaz.\r\n13:420, 1881.\r\n\r\n[299] Chron. 33:357, 1881.\r\n\r\n[300] R. R. Gaz. 13:420, 1881.\r\n\r\n[301] Prominent among them were Messrs. Clyde, of the Coast Line\r\nrailroads, Wilson and McGhee of the East Tennessee, Stewart, Plant,\r\nLogan, and others.\r\n\r\n[302] This had been the Atlanta & Richmond Air Line.\r\n\r\n[303] Chron. 37:128, 1883.\r\n\r\n[304] Chron. 39:733, 1884.\r\n\r\n[305] Chron. 40:29, 1885.\r\n\r\n[306] The committee overestimated the net earnings of the next few\r\nyears. Instead of $1,400,000 each year these proved to be $1,288,343 in\r\n1885 and $1,382,749 in 1886.\r\n\r\n[307] Chron. 40:60, 1885. There was some dispute as to the jurisdiction\r\nof the different courts in this connection. The Circuit Court appointed\r\nMr. Fink receiver for the whole line on January 7. The next day a state\r\ncourt appointed R. T. Dorsey and E. P. Alexander receivers for the\r\nlines in Georgia under another mortgage. This suit was removed to the\r\nFederal Court and Dorsey, who had meantime been appointed sole receiver\r\nin Georgia, was displaced. Subsequently the Georgia Supreme Court held\r\nthat the transfer was illegal, and Dorsey vainly endeavored to regain\r\nhis position. The dispute was ended by the withdrawal of the suit upon\r\nwhich the Georgia application was based.\r\n\r\n[308] Son-in-law of George Seney.\r\n\r\n[309] This committee was chosen by the consolidated bondholders. Its\r\nmembership consisted of Robert Fleming, a representative of the foreign\r\nholders; Charles McGhee, president of the Memphis & Charleston; G. W.\r\nSmith, of Kountze Bros.; Frederic D. Tappan, president of the Gallatin\r\nNational Bank; E. W. Corlies, vice-president of the Bank of America;\r\nand Frederick P. Olcott, president of the Central Trust Company, which\r\nwas trustee of the mortgages of the company. Chron. 42:155, 1886.\r\n\r\n[310] As might have been expected, this estimate was too optimistic.\r\nThe actual reduction was to $1,167,000. Even this constituted a cut of\r\nabout one-third.\r\n\r\n[311] Chron. 42:186–7, 1886. See also Poor’s Manual for 1886.\r\n\r\n[312] The reader will remember that that same year the general manager\r\nhad estimated the sum required for steel rails, iron bridges, and other\r\nimprovements at $1,000,000.\r\n\r\n[313] It is true that the severity of the treatment of the junior\r\nsecurities caused sharp protest. A number of the stockholders met in\r\nNew York February 23, and appointed a committee to prepare a plan\r\nof assessment and to oppose foreclosure. Under the auspices of this\r\ncommittee, Messrs. William H. Sistare and Harold Clemens filed a suit\r\nagainst the reorganization committee of the East Tennessee Company.\r\nThe capitalization of the company, said they, had been fraudulently\r\ninflated by the members of the Thompson-Seney-Brice syndicate. By false\r\nreports these financiers had unloaded upon the public securities which\r\nthey had previously distributed among themselves, and then had entered\r\nupon a scheme for wrecking the property. The suits made specific\r\ncharges of irregularity, and prayed for relief. Ry. Age, 11:192, 1886.\r\n\r\n[314] Chron. 42:364, 1886.\r\n\r\n[315] Ibid. 42:575, 1886.\r\n\r\n[316] Ibid. 42:663, 1886. In a circular to their constituents this\r\ncommittee said: “That after a full and satisfactory presentation of\r\nthe case by very able counsel it appeared that the committee had\r\nbeen misinformed as to the material facts upon which their case was\r\npredicated. It especially appeared to the Court that there was no\r\nground for the charge of fraud against the directors of the Company\r\nor the Central Trust Company. It further appeared that the litigation\r\nmust be a protracted one, without substantial benefit to either party.\r\nYour committee were not willing to assume the responsibility of such a\r\ncontest, in view of the expressed willingness of the majority to give\r\nto the minority the same terms which they had accepted for themselves.\r\nIt was deemed wise to harmonize all interests, and join hands to\r\npromote the future of the property.”\r\n\r\n[317] Annual Report, East Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia, 1887.\r\n\r\n[318] Chron. 37:344, 1883. The debentures were cumulative income bonds\r\nentitled to 6 per cent out of earnings after payment of interest,\r\nrentals, and operating expenses, including expenditures made for the\r\nrepair, renewal, and improvement of existing property and equipment\r\nnecessary for the proper conduct of the business of the railroad.\r\nCertain provisions of the mortgage protected them against the insertion\r\nof new mortgage bonds before them. Chron. 37:373, 1883.\r\n\r\n[319] Curiously enough the chief saving seems to have been in\r\nmaintenance of cars, an expenditure which one would expect to be least\r\naffected by the syndicate control.\r\n\r\n[320] Chron. 36:56, 1883.\r\n\r\n[321] R. R. Gaz. 18:138, 1886.\r\n\r\n[322] Chron. 42:575, 1886.\r\n\r\n[323] The Richmond & Danville guaranteed interest on some $12,500,000\r\nof Virginia Midland bonds.\r\n\r\n[324] Cf. Poor’s Manual for 1887.\r\n\r\n[325] The very high average price of $200 per share was reported to\r\nhave been paid. R. R. Gaz. 18:825, 1886; cf. R. R. Gaz. 19:162–3, 1887.\r\nThe Terminal Company issued $5,000,000 new preferred and $9,000,000\r\ncommon stock. Of this it sold the preferred and $7,500,000 of the\r\ncommon, giving to every holder of 100 of its shares the right to\r\nsubscribe to the extent of one-third of the par value of his stock, and\r\nto receive for his subscription 33⅓ shares of the new preferred and 50\r\nshares of common. Then to the $5,000,000 cash thus secured the Terminal\r\nCompany added the $1,500,000 common stock left from its $9,000,000\r\nissue, and turned the whole over to the Richmond & Danville in payment\r\nfor the securities which it had purchased. R. R. Gaz. 18:825, 1886.\r\n\r\n[326] The floating debt amounted to $3,161,325 when Mr. Sully assumed\r\nthe presidency, and $1,708,700 of it matured January 1. Chron. 44:401,\r\n1887. To provide for it, and for the Richmond & Danville shares,\r\n$5,500,000 6 per cent collateral trust bonds were issued, secured by\r\nEast Tennessee first preferred, Richmond & Danville stock, Columbia &\r\nGreenville stock, Virginia Midland stock, and Western North Carolina\r\nbonds; and also $16,000,000 common stock. The bonds were sold for cash\r\nand the returns applied to the East Tennessee purchase and to the\r\nfloating debt; $5,000,000 of the stock went for East Tennessee first\r\npreferred, and the rest for Richmond & Danville common, Washington,\r\nOhio & Western stock and income bonds, and for other purposes.

Why did the directors of the Terminal Company purchase sixty-five\r\nthousand shares of that stock at par, when fifty-five thousand and one\r\nshares would have been sufficient to have given the Terminal Company\r\na majority of that stock, the minority stock at that time selling at\r\nabout eighty?\r\n\r\n“2d. Why was the minority stock of the Danville Railroad Company\r\npurchased at the same time at a price which then amounted to about two\r\nhundred dollars per share, being a premium of one hundred per cent?\r\n\r\n“3d. Is it true that the majority of the committee appointed for the\r\npurpose of negotiating the purchase of the stock of the East Tennessee\r\nCompany consisted of directors of the Terminal Company largely\r\ninterested in the minority stock of the Danville Company?” Chron.\r\n46:579, 1888.\r\n\r\n[339] Chron. 46:449, 1888. The opposition pamphlet is reprinted in\r\nChron. 46:579, 1888.

Age, 14:78, 1889.\r\n\r\n[349] The failure of this initial suit encouraged the Richmond Terminal\r\nto take steps to make its position more secure. In February, 1889,\r\na collateral trust mortgage of $24,300,000 was announced, intended\r\nnot only to pay off the floating debt and several classes of bonds,\r\nbut also to purchase the balance of common stock of the Central of\r\nGeorgia and Richmond & Danville and of the first preferred stock of\r\nEast Tennessee outstanding. See Poor’s Manual for 1890; also Chron.\r\n48:764, 1889. Subsequently the company issued common shares of its own\r\ninstead of bonds in exchange for the East Tennessee first preferred,\r\nand succeeded in securing nearly $2,000,000 of the outstanding issue.\r\nChron. 49:374, 1889. The rate of exchange was 3¼ to 1. The Richmond\r\n& Danville shares were retired by new collateral bonds at 85, plus\r\n$26 per share in cash, and in connection with the operation more\r\nstock and $5,700,000 collateral bonds were sold on favorable terms to\r\nstockholders to provide for the floating debt.\r\n\r\n[350] For replies by Alexander and Inman, see New York _Herald_, August\r\n10, 1891, and Chron. 53:224, 1891.\r\n\r\n[351] At 97½.

The composition of this committee was\r\nseverely criticised, partly on the ground of the relations of Norton\r\nand Schiff to the Louisville & Nashville and to the Norfolk & Western\r\nrespectively, and partly on the ground that the other members were\r\ncreditors only and had no interest other than the repayment of their\r\nloans. It would seem, however, that the property was likely to have\r\nfared better in the hands of reputable New York bankers than in the\r\nhands in which it had formerly reposed.\r\n\r\n[354] Chron. 53:922, 1891.\r\n\r\n[355] Chron. 53:969, 1891. The members were: F. P. Olcott; Col. Oliver\r\nH. Payne; F. D. Tappan, president of the Gallatin National Bank;\r\nW. H. Perkins, president of the Bank of America; and Henry Budge, of\r\nHallgarten & Co. These gentlemen appointed Messrs. Olcott, Budge, and\r\nPerkins a sub-committee to prepare a plan. Ry. Rev. 32:14, 1892.\r\n\r\n[356] This excluded the Central of Georgia and the Alabama Great\r\nSouthern. The figure was based on existing bonded debt, floating debt,\r\nand rentals. It included car trust payments, but excluded taxes, which\r\nwere included in operating expenses, and excluded also the interest on\r\nsecurities owned by the system or the various corporations composing\r\nthe system.\r\n\r\n[357] The plan in full is reprinted in Chron. 54:487, 1892.\r\n\r\n[358] Consider for instance the treatment of the Richmond Terminal\r\npreferred stock. This was quoted in December, 1891, as low as 45. The\r\nplan accorded it 100 per cent in new bonds and 20 per cent in new\r\npreferred stock. _Per contra_, the Richmond & Danville consolidated\r\n5s were quoted the same months at 75 and received 100 per cent in new\r\nbonds and 40 per cent in new preferred. Was it any wonder that the\r\nholders of prior liens refused to come in?\r\n\r\n[359] Chron. 54:846, 1892.\r\n\r\n[360] These notes were to be secured by the same securities that were\r\nthen pledged to secure the floating debt and were to be exchanged for\r\n$170 in new preferred stock if the plan should prove successful.\r\n\r\n[361] Ry. Age, 17:414, 1892. It was not proposed to retain control\r\nof the Central of Georgia, but instead certificates of aliquot parts\r\nin the holdings of the Georgia stocks were to be issued to each\r\nstockholder, making him the actual owner of his proportionate share.\r\n\r\n[362] This committee was subsequently enlarged and became known as the\r\n“Independent Committee of Seventeen.”\r\n\r\n[363] Chron. 54:888, 1892.\r\n\r\n[364] Ibid. 55:23, 1892. On July 6, Chairman Strong, of the Advisory\r\nCommittee of Seventeen, appointed Messrs. George F. Stone, J. C. Maben,\r\nand W. E. Strong a sub-committee to further consider reorganization.\r\nChron. 55:59, 1892. Subsequently Mr. Strong appointed Messrs. Coppell,\r\nManson, and Plant a committee to look after the Terminal 5s, and\r\nMessrs. Bull, Goadby, and Cyrus J. Lawrence a committee to look\r\nafter the 6s. Mr. Strong, as chairman of the Advisory Committee,\r\nwas ex-officio member of each. The first of August Messrs. Thompson\r\nDean, Albert B. Boardman, and Charles P. Huntington were appointed a\r\ncommittee by the holders of between 50,000 and 60,000 shares of stock\r\nand other securities of the Richmond Terminal system, “for the purpose\r\nof removing the obstacles which now stand in the way of a fair and\r\nequitable reorganization of the Richmond & West Point Terminal Railway\r\n& Warehouse Company and its constituent corporations, and to this end\r\nto employ attorneys and to take all necessary steps to secure the\r\nappointment of permanent receivers, who will be in the interest of no\r\nclique or faction in said companies.” Chron. 55:216, 1892. See in this\r\nconnection Ry. Rev. 32:521, 1892.\r\n\r\n[365] R. R. Gaz. 24:33, 1892.

Clyde, etc.\r\n\r\n[370] Chron. 54:1010, 1892. Messrs. Huidekoper and Foster were also\r\nappointed receivers by courts in Virginia, North Carolina, and South\r\nCarolina.

The committee also stated that the\r\nTerminal Company had been made to purchase $1,800,000 Georgia state\r\nbonds at par and interest, which paid only 3½ per cent a year, although\r\nthe company was unable to borrow money at less than 6 per cent; that\r\nthe drafts of the directors to a large amount were paid by the company,\r\nand that no vouchers were on file to show how this money was expended.\r\n\r\n[372] Chron. 55:938, 1892.\r\n\r\n[373] Chron. 55:1078, 1892. For replies of defendants see Chron.\r\n56:414, 1893, and Ibid. 972, 1893.\r\n\r\n[374] This was the letter finally declining to undertake the\r\nreorganization in 1892 because of lack of assurances of support.\r\n\r\n[375] The correspondence appears in full in Chron. 56:207, 1893, and\r\nIbid. 56:622, 1893.\r\n\r\n[376] Ry. Rev. 33:95, 1893.\r\n\r\n[377] These needs had already been emphasized by the Olcott plan.\r\n\r\n[378] Lack of space forbids a full statement of the criticisms which\r\nthe Drexel plan had to make upon the physical condition and financial\r\npractice of the Richmond Terminal properties. The following is from\r\nthe plan, section 9: “As an example of the manner in which accounts\r\nhave been kept, it may be mentioned that in the operating expenses of\r\nthe entire Richmond & Danville system only $20,000 were charged for\r\nrenewal of rails in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1890, and not a\r\ndollar in the fiscal years ending June 30, 1891 and 1892, respectively.\r\nIn seven months under the receivership (July, 1892, to January, 1893,\r\ninclusive) about $600 were charged. Since that date, it is understood,\r\nabout $18,000 have been charged. With these exceptions all renewals of\r\nrails were charged to construction accounts. Renewals, properly to be\r\nincluded in operating expenses, would be at least $100,000 to $150,000\r\nper annum.” Other instances, almost as bad, could be stated.\r\n\r\n[379]\r\n\r\n  Total cash requirements, as estimated, were:\r\n      Floating debt, including equipment notes           $12,900,000\r\n      New construction and equipment during two years      8,000,000\r\n      Expenses of reorganization and contingencies         2,350,000\r\n                                                         -----------\r\n                                                         $23,250,000\r\n\r\n  To be provided from:\r\n      Assessments on Terminal stock                       $8,750,000\r\n      Assessments on East Tennessee stocks                 2,700,000\r\n      Sale of $33,333,000 new common stock                 5,000,000\r\n      Sale of $8,000,000 new bonds                         6,800,000\r\n                                                         -----------\r\n                                                         $23,250,000\r\n\r\n\r\n[380] The new company reserved the right at any time to redeem its\r\npreferred stock in cash at par.\r\n\r\n[381] Of which $104,303,894 for stock and the rest for bonds\r\noutstanding.\r\n\r\n[382] The reorganization plan estimated the capitalization under its\r\nprovisions at about $20,000 per mile of road owned and controlled;\r\nabout $10,000 preferred stock per mile owned and controlled; about\r\n$25,000 common stock per mile owned and controlled.\r\n\r\n[383] The plan is published in full in Chron. 56:874, 1893.\r\n\r\n[384] Ry. Rev. 33:388, 1893.\r\n\r\n[385] Modified reorganization plan. Chron. 58:385, 1894. Some\r\ninformation concerning traffic conditions in the South in 1894 is\r\nto be found in the Eighth Annual Report of the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission, pp. 20–24.\r\n\r\n[386] From $140,000,000 5 per cent bonds, $75,000,000 preferred and\r\n$160,000,000 common stock to $120,000,000 bonds, $60,000,000 preferred\r\nand $125,000,000 common stock. Since, however, some of the poorer\r\nproperties were cut off and the terms granted to others were made more\r\nliberal, the smaller absolute amount of new securities represented a\r\ngreater relative increase than before.\r\n\r\n[387] The actual charges in 1895 were $4,195,000.\r\n\r\n[388] “The increase in car trusts is due to the existence of about\r\n$1,200,000 of such obligations on the Richmond & Danville system,\r\n_which, up to the date of the plan of reorganization, had not\r\nbeen entered on the ledger of either the Railway Company or its\r\nReceivers, although, as it appears, they were well known_.” Modified\r\nreorganization plan.\r\n\r\n[389] R. R.

It was then sold to Oakleigh Thorne, president of the Trust\r\nCompany of America, and Marsden J. Perry. Later the same year these\r\ngentlemen resold this stock to E. H. Harriman and his associates.\r\n\r\n[396] The original estimate was $19,000,000. The amount available seems\r\nto have been finally $20,000,000.\r\n\r\n[397] The voting trust was extended in 1902, in respect to a majority\r\nof the stock, for a period of five years.

The directors defended their action as follows:\r\n\r\n“In forming a just opinion of this matter,” said they, “it is necessary\r\nto recall to the stockholders the statement made in the circular of\r\nJuly 30, 1887.... It was stated in the circular referred to that for\r\nthe six months ending July 1, 1887, the net earnings exceeded by more\r\nthan $1,200,000 the net earnings for the first six months of the year\r\n1886, that the earnings were still increasing, and what has always\r\nbeen true in the past may be expected this year also; namely, that the\r\nrevenue of the second six months of the year will be considerably in\r\nexcess of that of the first six months.... It will ... be seen that\r\n... the year 1887 formed a remarkable exception to what had hitherto\r\nbeen the regular course of Atchison’s earnings; the second half of that\r\nyear showing an increase over the first half of only $278,096 gross,\r\nand $204,144 net.... Drouths, failure of crops, excessive competition,\r\ncontinually decreasing rates, unwise legislation, strikes, and other\r\ncalamities have befallen us as they have other Western roads; but your\r\ndirectors could not know in advance that any of these unfavorable\r\nconditions would have to be met, much less that they would all have to\r\nbe met at one and the same time.” Annual Report, 1888.\r\n\r\nThis defence was altogether unsatisfactory. An increase in the dividend\r\nrate is too important to be justified by anything but earnings actually\r\nin hand. Moreover, the conditions which the directors held responsible\r\nfor the decline in Atchison earnings were either well known at the time\r\nwhen the dividend was declared, or could easily have been anticipated.\r\nIt was even alleged that the decrease in business which the annual\r\nreport for 1888 disclosed was due to lessened carriage of company\r\nmaterial to the West for construction of new track, and not to crop\r\nfailure or other decline in general business. See R. R. Gaz. 21:327,\r\n1889.\r\n\r\n[418] Chron. 47:472, 1888. The use of $3,000,000 of the notes was\r\nspecifically deferred.\r\n\r\n[419] Ry.

Second mortgage B bonds received 118 per cent. “After careful\r\nconsideration,” said the plan, “it was decided to be best for the\r\ninterest of those [the second mortgage] securities that they should now\r\nbe converted into 5 per cent preferred stock, possessing full voting\r\npowers and preferential rights as to principal as well as interest,\r\nrather than revert to their original form of ‘Income Bonds.’ It was not\r\nthought that a greater assessment than $10 could be raised from the\r\nstock, and the remainder had to come from the junior bonds.”\r\n\r\n[445] The plan of reorganization was published separately, but was\r\nreprinted in Chron. 60:658, 1895.\r\n\r\n[446] Ry.

Some $30,000,000 besides, it is supposed, were\r\nborrowed from the banks.\r\n\r\n[537] Testimony of Mr. Harriman before the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission. It is true that the Northern Securities stock held by the\r\nUnion Pacific system had been pledged as security for an equal amount\r\nof Oregon Short Line 4 per cent and Participating 4s, and that when\r\nthese bonds were refunded there was pledged for the new issue whatever\r\nthe Union Pacific interests should receive in exchange for their\r\nNorthern Securities holdings, and any other shares or bonds at not\r\nexceeding 80 per cent of their appraised value. But the purchase of the\r\nSouthern Pacific and of the Northern Pacific stocks had been previously\r\nfinanced by an issue of convertible collateral bonds for which other\r\ncollateral had been pledged. From 1904 on, the rising price of Union\r\nPacific stock made conversion desirable and rapidly released the\r\nsecurities back of the original issue. These released securities, with\r\n$18,000,000 Southern Pacific preferred stock paid to the Union Pacific\r\nin 1904 (with $2,460,960 cash), proved a sufficient pledge for the\r\nOregon Short Line refunding bonds, and the Great Northern and Northern\r\nPacific stock shares were therefore free for other purposes.\r\n\r\n[538] Annual Report, 1907.

Such\r\ncourt should be the court of primary jurisdiction. But in view of the\r\nfact that a portion of the line of road owned by the Northern Pacific\r\nCompany is within the State of Wisconsin, and that at the time of the\r\nfiling of the creditors’ bill the Northern Pacific Railroad Company\r\nwas operating a road through the Eastern District of Wisconsin,\r\nalthough such road was under lease to it for 99 years; and in view\r\nof the further fact that the railroad company assented to the action\r\nof the Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin in taking\r\njurisdiction, and as such jurisdiction has been recognized by the\r\nCircuit Court in every district ... for the space of about two years,\r\nwe are of the opinion that the Circuit Court for the Eastern District\r\nof Wisconsin has jurisdiction to proceed to a decree of foreclosure\r\nwhich will bind the mortgagor company and the mortgaged property, and\r\nought to be recognized by the Circuit Court of every district along the\r\nline as the court of primary jurisdiction.” Chron. 62:234, 1896.\r\n\r\n[628] Justice Field of the Supreme Court declined to exercise his\r\nauthority to remove Burleigh, intimating that the existing arrangement\r\nwas satisfactory.

But it is usually very well secured.\r\n\r\n[682] In the case of the Rock Island in 1902 there was no floating\r\ndebt to be considered, while in 1885 the Erie funded overdue coupons\r\nand issued a 6 per cent mortgage on its Jersey City terminals to cover\r\naccumulated liabilities, but did not disturb its outstanding mortgage\r\nbonds, and cannot, therefore, be said to have reorganized.\r\n\r\n[683] This was, in fact, a prominent feature of the reorganizations\r\nbetween 1893 and 1898. The Atchison surrendered the St. Louis & San\r\nFrancisco; the Erie absorbed the New York, Pennsylvania & Ohio into its\r\nsystem instead of continuing the lease thereof; the Northern Pacific\r\nsurrendered the lease of the Wisconsin Central and cancelled various\r\nunprofitable traffic contracts and traffic agreements; the Reading\r\ngave up the Lehigh Valley and its New England extensions; the Southern\r\nreduced its mileage by over one-half; and the Union Pacific shrunk from\r\n7674 miles in 1892 to 5399 in 1899.\r\n\r\n[684] See Interstate Commerce Commission: In the Matter of\r\nConsolidations and Combinations of Carriers, etc., 12 I. C. C. Rep. 319.\r\n\r\n[685] Testimony of C. F. Adams, United States Pacific Railway\r\nCommission Report, 1887, vol. 1, p. 45.\r\n\r\n[686] “It is only by the fullest knowledge of the affairs of the\r\ncompany that a correct judgment of the best manner of meeting its wants\r\ncan be formed, and there is no other practicable way to manage the\r\nbusiness of the company to its best advantage than for the stockholders\r\nto elect directors worthy of confidence, and to leave the management to\r\nthem.” Annual Report, 1887, Robert Harris, President.\r\n\r\n[687] In the case of the Atchison, old income bonds were retired by\r\nnew second mortgage bonds, with the result that the aggregate value of\r\ncreditors’ holdings was largely increased.\r\n\r\n[688] Speech at Columbus, Ohio, August 19, 1907.\r\n\r\n[689] Forum, September, 1890, and March, 1894.\r\n\r\n[690] The percentages for the Atchison are corrected according to the\r\nreport of Mr. Little. Owing to the lack of available detail it has\r\nbeen necessary to increase operating expenses by the total amount of\r\nthe errors which he discovered, and this figure is, therefore, unduly\r\ninflated.\r\n\r\n[691] In 1893, after the Northern Pacific failure, the consolidated\r\n5 per cent bondholders formed a committee; Mr. Brayton Ives invited\r\nbondholders to send in their names and addresses to him (1894); and\r\nlater in 1894 the falling off in the railroad’s earnings induced the\r\nformation of the Livingston and Van Nostrand committees, and the\r\nannouncement of the consolidated committee that it would accept the\r\ndeposit of second and third mortgage bonds. Finally, within four months\r\nafter the Atchison failure of 1893, four important reorganization\r\ncommittees were asking for deposits in the United States and one was\r\nsoliciting deposits in London.\r\n\r\n[692] The officers of bankrupt roads have no need of committees to\r\nmake their wishes known, but only so far as they are bondholders,\r\nor in so far as they can influence bondholders by argument do their\r\nopinions carry weight. President Ives of the Northern Pacific in\r\n1893 was able to use his position to fight his opponents through the\r\ncourts, and secured besides appointment on a stockholders’ protective\r\ncommittee, but exercised no great influence on the reorganization;\r\nPresident Jewett, of the Erie, gained the confidence of the visiting\r\ncommittee of English bondholders in 1875, and had some voice accorded\r\nhim; but generally speaking officers have to rest content if they\r\ncan successfully defend themselves against charges of inefficiency\r\nand mismanagement. They are, in fact, both the choice and the\r\nrepresentatives of the stockholders, and the stockholders having no\r\nauthority in the event of bankruptcy can delegate none. Officers of\r\nthe courts which are in control of bankrupt railroads enjoy sometimes\r\na different position from officers of the corporations themselves, in\r\nthat they do not represent or depend on stockholders, and may not be\r\nconnected with the circumstances which have caused the ruin of the\r\nroad. Thus the receivers of the Union Pacific in the nineties were\r\ncalled to testify before Congressional committees, and those of the\r\nErie chose a committee which prepared the first reorganization plan\r\nsuggested, but in both cases the functions of the court officers were\r\npurely advisory, and so they must always be.\r\n\r\n[693] In 1895 the final Atchison reorganization plan announced the\r\nfollowing arrangement: “A contract has been made with a syndicate to\r\nfurnish an amount of money equal to the assessments of non-assenting\r\nor defaulting stockholders, and such syndicate, by such payment, shall\r\ntake the place of the non-assenting or defaulting stockholders, and\r\nshall be entitled to receive the new common and preferred stock, which\r\nnon-assenting or defaulting stockholders would have been entitled to\r\nreceive if they had deposited their stock and paid their assessment in\r\nfull. Syndicates may also be formed to furnish the money needed, in\r\ncase of foreclosure, to pay the non-assenting bondholders their _pro\r\nrata_ share of the proceeds of sale, and to advance any cash which may\r\nbe required during the reorganization and for other purposes.” Chron.\r\n60:658–62, 1895. The reorganization plan of the Baltimore & Ohio in\r\n1898 contained the following: “A syndicate has been formed ... which\r\nagrees: 1st, To purchase $6,975,000 of the new preferred stock, and\r\n$30,250,000 of the new common stock, and to offer the same for sale to\r\ndepositing holders of old 1st and 2d preferred and common stock of the\r\nBaltimore & Ohio Railroad Company.... 2d, To purchase $9,000,000 3½\r\nper cent prior lien bonds; $12,450,000 1st mortgage 4 per cent bonds;\r\n$16,450,000 preferred stock. 3d, To protect the new company in the\r\nownership and possession of the properties covered by $49,974,098 ...\r\nof the existing mortgage bonds of the old company of different issues\r\nby agreeing to purchase from the new company the new securities not\r\ntaken, but to which the holders of such bonds would have been entitled\r\nif depositing under the plan, at a price equal to the principal of the\r\nrespective old securities, and also to make advances and perform other\r\nobligations essential for the purposes of the plan.” Poor’s Manual,\r\n1898, p. 1381. Similar provisions appear in the plans of the Erie, the\r\nNorthern Pacific, the Reading, the Southern, and the Union Pacific.\r\n\r\n[694] In 1894.\r\n\r\n[695] H. V. Poor (Manual, 1900) compiles the following statement for 57\r\nselected companies reorganized between 1886 and 1898:\r\n\r\n   _Securities provided for other corporate purposes of new companies_\r\n\r\n  Capital stock:                Bonded Indebt.\r\n      Preferred, $89,971,268        Int.-bearing, $538,277,638\r\n      Common,     96,555,753        Income,         48,902,701\r\n\r\n\r\n[696] Where stock- or bondholders are compelled to subscribe to an\r\nissue of new securities the operation becomes an assessment and not a\r\nsale.\r\n\r\n[697] Among the reorganizations of the eighties, for instance, the\r\nDenver & Rio Grande levied $8 per share in 1885 upon its $38,000,000\r\ncommon stock; the Pittsburgh & Western assessed its common stock 4 per\r\ncent in 1887; the New York, Chicago & St. Louis assessed its common\r\n$10, and its preferred an equal sum; and the Central Iowa levied 2½ per\r\ncent on its debt certificates, 5 per cent on its 1st preferred stock,\r\n10 per cent on its 2d preferred, and 15 per cent on its common. See\r\nChron. 40:480; Ibid. 44:212, 370, 653.\r\n\r\n[698] A syndicate guaranteed the assessment in each case between 1893\r\nand 1898. The Reading assessment is calculated on a par of $100.\r\n\r\n[699] The assessments before 1893 were as follows: The Erie levied\r\n2½ per cent on its common and preferred in 1859, and a minimum of $4\r\non its common and $2 on its preferred in 1877, with no allowance of\r\nnew securities in either case. The East Tennessee assessed its common\r\nstock 6 per cent and its income mortgage 5 per cent in 1886, and gave\r\nto the one a corresponding amount of 2d preferred, and to the other\r\nof 1st preferred stock. The Reading assessments in 1886 ranged from\r\n2½ per cent on the deferred incomes to 15 per cent on certain junior\r\nsecurities, with an assessment of $10 on both classes of stock.\r\nPreferred stock was given for all assessments up to the full amount of\r\nthe sums taken.\r\n\r\n[700] The quotations six months after reorganization are for the\r\ncombined securities given in exchange for the old preferred stock. In\r\nthe case of the Baltimore & Ohio _e. g._, this was 150 per cent in new\r\ncommon; for the Northern Pacific it was 50 per cent new common and 50\r\nper cent new preferred. Only $5,000,000 of Baltimore & Ohio preferred\r\nstock were outstanding before the reorganization of 1898, and no record\r\nof quotations can be found. Quotations are similarly unobtainable for\r\nthe Reading in 1886.\r\n\r\n[701] The very large increase in the Baltimore & Ohio quotations was\r\ndoubtless due to the lateness of the reorganization.\r\n\r\n[702] Chron. Investors’ Supplement, January, 1894.\r\n\r\n[703] Ibid. 62:641, 1896.\r\n\r\n[704] Chron. 45:792, 1887 (reorganization plan). See also Chron.\r\n49:269, 1889.\r\n\r\n[705] Pages 84–5, _supra_.\r\n\r\n[706] Chron. 50:141, 1890.\r\n\r\n[707] Ibid. 58:762, 1894.\r\n\r\n[708] Chron. 62:829, 1896. Poor states in his Manual for 1900 that of\r\n$96,094,960 of assessments levied on securities of fifty-seven selected\r\ncompanies, $86,972,703 were on stock and $9,122,257 on bonds.\r\n\r\n[709] The figure of $9,043,944 is the true figure for the Reading fixed\r\ncharges after reorganization, eliminating duplications. In computing\r\nthe percentage of charges to earnings in 1898, however, the unrefined\r\nfigure of $12,210,291 is used in connection with a similarly unrefined\r\nfigure of earnings.\r\n\r\n[710] The reorganizations omitted are those of the Union Pacific in\r\n1880, which did not alter fixed charges, and of the Erie in 1859\r\nand the Northern Pacific in 1875, for which precise figures are not\r\navailable. In this last charges were almost entirely removed; its\r\nexclusion, therefore, tends to lessen the percentage of reduction shown\r\nfor the reorganizations before 1893.\r\n\r\n[711] The six reorganizations before 1893 include that of the Atchison\r\nin 1892, which was not caused by inability to earn charges, and\r\nconsequently made no attempt to lower their figure. Excluding this\r\nreorganization, the reductions in charges before 1893 overbalanced\r\nthe increases. H. V. Poor calculates the absolute reduction in fixed\r\ncharges for sixty-eight railroads reorganized between 1885 and 1897 at\r\n$24,007,490. (Manual, 1900, p. cvi.)\r\n\r\n[712] The decrease in charges per mile for the Reading in 1880 was due,\r\nnot to any reduction in charges, but to an increase in mileage through\r\nthe lease of the Central Railroad of New Jersey. In this case the\r\nincrease in absolute charges better represents the real effect of the\r\nreorganization.\r\n\r\n[713] It is perhaps unnecessary to warn the reader that these tables\r\ncan be taken as generally indicative only. The percentage of charges\r\nto earnings varies not only with charges but with earnings; and an\r\nincrease or decrease in the latter may conceal a decidedly contrary\r\nmovement in the former. Since the reorganizations were accomplished at\r\ndifferent dates the error is not in all cases in the same direction,\r\nand in particular the percentage of charges to earnings for one road\r\ncannot be compared with the percentage for another. The figures\r\nof charges per mile of line are somewhat more reliable, but are\r\nnevertheless to be used with care. Different railroads report their\r\nmileage differently, and it has not been possible in all cases to use\r\nthe homogeneous figure of mileage operated. Further, the significance\r\nof high charges per mile varies with the character of the mileage.\r\nA reorganization which lops off many unprofitable branch lines may\r\nconceivably cause thereby an increase in the charges per mile of road\r\nremaining, and yet place the system in a much stronger position than\r\nbefore. This difficulty disappears if the figure of charges per mile be\r\nused in connection with the percentage of charges to earnings, and in\r\ngeneral the three columns given correct each other.\r\n\r\n[714] These figures do not include the comparatively small amount of\r\nbonds for which no interest rate was specified.\r\n\r\n[715] Income bonds sometimes, though rarely, possess the right to vote.\r\n\r\n[716] E. S. Meade, Annals Amer. Acad. Pol. and Soc. Sci. March, 1901.\r\n\r\n[717] The figure for the Reading in 1880 is affected by the lease\r\nof the Central of New Jersey, which took place simultaneously with\r\nthe reorganization. Excluding the increase in rentals, the remaining\r\nincrease in fixed charges amounted to only 9.5 per cent. The East\r\nTennessee reported no rentals in either 1885 or in 1887. The data for\r\nthe Southern Railway are not in such shape that rentals and interest\r\ncan be compared. Its reorganization reduced rentals, however, very\r\ngreatly.\r\n\r\n[718] The 32 per cent paid has been included under rentals.\r\n\r\n[719] Government Debt.\r\n\r\n[720] In considering the capitalization of the Erie before and after\r\nthe reorganization of 1895 the securities of the New York, Pennsylvania\r\n& Ohio have been excluded.\r\n\r\n[721] The difficulties which prevent wider extension of these tables\r\nconsist partly in the absence of quotations for certain classes of\r\nbonds, and partly in the lack of sufficiently detailed and precise\r\ninformation in some of the early reorganization plans. Thus there are\r\nno quotations recorded in 1874–5 for the 2d consols and convertible\r\nbonds of the Erie Railroad which were disturbed by the subsequent\r\nreorganization; and no detailed figures of the exchange of new\r\nbonds for old appear in the reports of the reorganization plans of\r\nthe Reading in 1881–3, and of the Northern Pacific in 1875. The\r\nreorganization of the Union Pacific and of the Chicago, Rock Island &\r\nPacific in 1880 did not disturb the bonds outstanding.\r\n\r\n[722] The twenty-six railroads are as follows: Canad.

In this eBook, all such references omit the space (123:456).\r\n\r\nDuplicate headings were removed by Transcriber.\r\n\r\nIn this version of this eBook, some tables were rearranged to make them\r\nnarrower.\r\n\r\nPage 11: \"J. S. Morgan\" was printed that way, and there was such a\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nPage 205: The reference to Footnote 430 was missing. Transcriber\r\narbitrarily added it at a likely place.\r\n\r\nPage 244: \"the interest were cancelled\" was printed that way.\r\n\r\nPage 341: Numbered list has no item #6.\r\n\r\nPage 379: The year-headings in the original book appeared above the\r\ndollar values, which seems to be a typographical error. In this eBook,\r\nthey have been centered above the Month-dollar values columns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Railroad Reorganization, by Stuart Daggett",
