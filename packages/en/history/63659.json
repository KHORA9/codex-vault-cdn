Because\r\nthe Air Force was a major player in those events, we have played a key\r\nrole in executing the General Accounting Office’s tasking to uncover\r\nall records regarding that incident.\r\n\r\nOur objective throughout this inquiry has been simple and consistent:\r\nto find all the facts and bring them to light. If documents were\r\nclassified, declassify them; where they were dispersed, bring them into\r\na single source for public review.\r\n\r\nIn July 1994, we completed the first step in that effort and later\r\npublished _The Roswell Report: Fact vs. Fiction in the New Mexico\r\nDesert_. This volume represents the necessary follow-on to that first\r\npublication and contains additional material and analysis. I think that\r\nwith this publication we have reached our goal of a complete and open\r\nexplanation of the events that occurred in the Southwest many years ago.\r\n\r\nBeyond that achievement, this inquiry has shed fascinating light into\r\nthe Air Force of that era and revitalized our appreciation for the\r\ndedication and accomplishments of the men and women of that time. As we\r\ncelebrate the Air Force’s 50th Anniversary, it is appropriate to once\r\nagain reflect on the sacrifices made by so many to make ours the finest\r\nair and space force in history.\r\n\r\n                                        SHEILA E. WIDNALL\r\n                                        Secretary of the Air Force\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Guide For Readers\r\n\r\n\r\nThis publication contains the complete report as submitted to the\r\nSecretary of the Air Force. The exceptions are the statements found\r\nin Appendix B. Due to Privacy Act restrictions and by request, the\r\naddresses of the individuals making these statements have been deleted.\r\n\r\nThis volume is divided into two sections, eight subsections, eleven\r\nsidebar discussions, and three appendices. Section One examines alleged\r\nevents at two locations in rural New Mexico. Section Two examines the\r\nalleged activities at the Roswell Army Airfield Hospital.\r\n\r\nAppendix A is a table listing the launch and landing locations of test\r\nequipment for U.S. Air Force scientific research projects HIGH DIVE and\r\nEXCELSIOR. Appendix B is a collection of signed sworn statements based\r\non in-person interviews conducted for this report by U.S. Air Force\r\nresearchers. The exception is the statement of Lt. Col. William C.\r\nKaufman, which was not sworn due to equipment failures at the time of\r\ninterview.\r\n\r\nAppendix C contains transcripts of interviews of alleged witnesses\r\npresented by UFO theorists. The interviews of Gerald Anderson, Alice\r\nKnight, and Vern Maltais were excerpted in their entirety from unedited\r\ninterviews used to prepare the video, _Recollections of Roswell, Part\r\nII_ (1993), and appear courtesy of the Fund for UFO Research. The\r\ninterview of Mr. W. Glenn Dennis was provided by the interviewer, Karl\r\nT. Pflock. The transcript of the interview of Mr. James Ragsdale was\r\nprovided by Kevin Randle, the coauthor of the _Truth About the UFO\r\nCrash at Roswell_ (Avon Books, 1994), in which direct quotes from this\r\ntranscript appear.\r\n\r\nA selected bibliography of technical reports and how to obtain them\r\nare found on page 221.

This attention has resulted in\r\ncountless newspaper and magazine articles, books, a television series,\r\na full-length motion picture, and even a film purported to be a U.S.\r\ngovernment “alien autopsy.”\r\n\r\nThe July 1994 Air Force report concluded that the predecessor to the\r\nU.S. Air Force, the U.S. Army Air Forces, did indeed recover material\r\nnear Roswell in July 1947. This 1,000-page report methodically explains\r\nthat what was recovered by the Army Air Forces was not the remnants of\r\nan extraterrestrial spacecraft and its alien crew, but debris from an\r\nArmy Air Forces balloon-borne research project code named MOGUL.[1]\r\nRecords located describing research carried out under the MOGUL\r\nproject, most of which were never classified (and publicly available)\r\nwere collected, provided to GAO, and published in one volume for ease\r\nof access for the general public.[*]\r\n\r\n[*] MOGUL records which ultimately lead to the identification of the\r\norigin of the 1947 claims of “flying saucer” debris, described balloon\r\nresearch that was never classified. Other MOGUL records, describing\r\nmilitary applications of balloon-borne acoustical sensors, were\r\ndeclassified, along with millions of pages of other unrelated executive\r\nbranch documents by Executive Order 11652, issued on March 6, 1972 by\r\nPresident Richard M. Nixon.\r\n\r\nAlthough MOGUL components clearly accounted for the claims of “flying\r\nsaucer” debris recovered in 1947, lingering questions remained\r\nconcerning anecdotal accounts that included descriptions of “alien”\r\nbodies. The issue of “bodies” was not discussed extensively in the 1994\r\nreport because there were not any bodies connected with events that\r\noccurred in 1947. The extensive Secretary of the Air Force-directed\r\nsearch of Army Air Forces and U.S. Air Force records from 1947 did not\r\nyield information that even suggested the 1947 “Roswell” events were\r\nanything other than the retrieval of the MOGUL equipment.[2]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 1. _The Roswell Report: Fact vs. Fiction\r\n  in the New Mexico Desert_ contains, in its entirety, the report\r\n  submitted to the Secretary of the Air Force in July 1994.

This in-depth examination\r\nrevealed that these accounts, in most instances, were of actual Air\r\nForce activities but were seriously flawed in several major areas, most\r\nnotably: the Air Force operations that inspired reports of “bodies” (in\r\naddition to being earthly in origin) did not occur in 1947. It appears\r\nthat UFO proponents have failed to establish the accurate dates for\r\nthese “alien” observations (in some instances by more than a decade)\r\nand then erroneously linked them to the actual Project MOGUL debris\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\nThis report discusses the results of this further research and\r\nidentifies the likely sources of the claims of “alien” bodies.\r\nContrary to allegations that the Air Force has engaged in a cover-up\r\nand possesses dark secrets involving the Roswell claims, some of\r\nthe accounts appear to be descriptions of unclassified and widely\r\npublicized Air Force scientific achievements. Other descriptions of\r\nbodies appear to be descriptions of actual incidents in which Air Force\r\nmembers were killed or injured in the line of duty.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions of the additional research are:\r\n\r\n  • Air Force activities which occurred over a period of many years\r\n  have been consolidated and are now represented to have occurred in\r\n  two or three days in July 1947.\r\n\r\n  • “Aliens” observed in the New Mexico desert were probably\r\n  anthropomorphic test dummies that were carried aloft by U.S. Air\r\n  Force high altitude balloons for scientific research.\r\n\r\n  • The “unusual” military activities in the New Mexico desert were\r\n  high altitude research balloon launch and recovery operations. The\r\n  reports of military units that always seemed to arrive shortly\r\n  after the crash of a flying saucer to retrieve the saucer and\r\n  “crew,” were actually accurate descriptions of Air Force personnel\r\n  engaged in anthropomorphic dummy recovery operations.\r\n\r\n  • Claims of bodies at the Roswell Army Air Field hospital were most\r\n  likely a combination of two separate incidents:\r\n\r\n    1) a 1956 KC-97 aircraft accident in which 11 Air Force members\r\n    lost their lives; and,\r\n\r\n    2) a 1959 manned balloon mishap in which two Air Force pilots were\r\n    injured.\r\n\r\nThis report is based on thoroughly documented research supported by\r\nofficial records, technical reports, film footage, photographs, and\r\ninterviews with individuals who were involved in these events.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 2.

The bodies turned what, for many years, was just another\r\nflying saucer story, into what many UFO proponents claim is the best\r\ncase for extraterrestrial visitation of Earth. The importance of bodies\r\nand the assumptions made as to their origin is illustrated in a passage\r\nfrom a popular Roswell book:\r\n\r\n  _Crashed saucers are one thing, and could well turn out to be\r\n  futuristic American or even foreign aircraft or missiles. But\r\n  alien bodies are another matter entirely, and hardly subject to\r\n  misinterpretation._[3]\r\n\r\nThe 1994 Air Force report determined that project MOGUL was responsible\r\nfor the 1947 events. MOGUL was an experimental attempt to acoustically\r\ndetect suspected Soviet nuclear weapon explosions and ballistic missile\r\nlaunches.[4] MOGUL utilized acoustical sensors, radar reflecting\r\ntargets and other devices attached to a train of weather balloons over\r\n600 feet long. Claims that the U.S. Army Air Forces recovered a “flying\r\ndisc” in 1947, were based primarily on the lack of identification of\r\nthe radar targets, an element of weather equipment used on the long\r\nMOGUL balloon train. The oddly constructed radar targets were found by\r\na New Mexico rancher during the height of the first U.S. flying saucer\r\nwave in 1947.[5] The rancher brought the remnants of the balloons and\r\nradar targets to the local sheriff after he allegedly learned of the\r\nbroadcasted reports of flying discs. However, following some initial\r\nconfusion at Roswell Army Air Field, the “flying disc” was soon\r\nidentified by Army Air Forces officials as a standard radar target.[6]\r\n\r\nFrom 1947 until the late 1970s, the Roswell Incident was essentially\r\na non-story. The reports that existed contain only descriptions of\r\nmundane materials that originated from the Project MOGUL balloon\r\ntrain—“tinfoil, paper, tape, rubber, and sticks.”[7] The first claim\r\nof “bodies” appeared in the late 1970s, with additional claims made\r\nduring the 1980s and 1990s. These claims were usually based on\r\nanecdotal accounts of second- and third-hand witnesses collected by UFO\r\nproponents as much as 40 years after the alleged incident. The same\r\nanecdotal accounts that referred to bodies also described massive field\r\noperations conducted by the U.S. military to recover crash debris from\r\na supposed extraterrestrial spaceship.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 3.

For example, one such solicitation appeared in\r\nthe _Socorro_ (N.M.) _Defensor Chieftain_ on November 4, 1992, on behalf\r\nof Don Berliner and Stanton T. Friedman, the authors of the book _Crash\r\nat Corona_. This request solicited persons to provide information about\r\nthe supposed crashes of alien spacecraft in the Socorro area.[8][*]\r\n\r\n  [*] Socorro, N.M. is situated at the northwest boundary of White\r\n  Sands Missile Range, the largest military test range in the United\r\n  States. Since the 1940s, White Sands and the surrounding areas of\r\n  New Mexico have been the site of a high volume of military test\r\n  and evaluation activity, including the launch and recovery of\r\n  anthropomorphic dummies carried aloft by high altitude balloons.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 4.

This account from the July 9, 1947 _Roswell\r\n  Daily Record_, described the materials “tinfoil, paper, rubber,\r\n  tape, and sticks” found on the ranch 75 miles northwest of Roswell,\r\n  in June 1947.\r\n\r\n  _Harassed Rancher who Located ‘Saucer’ Sorry He Told About It_\r\n\r\n  W. W. Brazel, 48, Lincoln county rancher living 30 miles south east\r\n  of Corona, today told his story of finding what the army at first\r\n  described as a flying disk, but the publicity which attended his\r\n  find caused him to add that if he ever found anything else short of\r\n  a bomb he sure wasn’t going to say anything about it.\r\n\r\n  Brazel was brought here late yesterday by W. E. Whitmore, of radio\r\n  station KGFL, had his picture taken and gave an interview to the\r\n  Record and Jason Kellahin, sent here from the Albuquerque bureau\r\n  of the Associated Press to cover the story. The picture he posed\r\n  for was sent out over AP telephoto wire sending machine specially\r\n  set up in the Record office by R. D. Adair, AP wire chief sent here\r\n  from Albuquerque for the sole purpose of getting out his picture\r\n  and that of sheriff George Wilcox, to whom Brazel originally gave\r\n  the information of his find.\r\n\r\n  Brazel related that on June 14 he and an 8-year old son, Vernon\r\n  were about 7 or 8 miles from the ranch house of the J. B. Foster\r\n  ranch, which he operates, when they came upon a large area of\r\n  bright wreckage made up on rubber strips, tinfoil, a rather tough\r\n  paper and sticks.\r\n\r\n  At the time Brazel was in a hurry to get his round made and he did\r\n  not pay much attention to it. But he did remark about what he had\r\n  seen and on July 4 he, his wife, Vernon and a daughter Betty, age\r\n  14, went back to the spot and gathered up quite a bit of the debris.\r\n\r\n  The next day he first heard about the flying disks, and he wondered\r\n  if what he had found might be the remnants of one of these.\r\n\r\n  Monday he came to town to sell some wool and while here he went to\r\n  see sheriff George Wilcox and “whispered kinda confidential like”\r\n  that he might have found a flying disk.\r\n\r\n  Wilcox got in touch with the Roswell Army Air Field and Maj. Jesse\r\n  A. Marcel and a man in plain clothes accompanied him home, where\r\n  they picked up the rest of the pieces of the “disk” and went to his\r\n  home to try to reconstruct it.\r\n\r\n  According to Brazel they simply could not reconstruct it at all.\r\n  They tried to make a kite, out of it, but could not do that and\r\n  could not find any way to put it back together so that it would fit.\r\n\r\n  Then Major Marcel brought it to Roswell and that was the last he\r\n  heard of it until the story broke that he had found a flying disk.\r\n\r\n  Brazel said that he did not see it fall from the sky and did not\r\n  see it before it was torn up, so he did not know the size or shape\r\n  it might have been, but he thought it might have been about as\r\n  large as a table top. The balloon which held it up, if that was how\r\n  it worked, must have been about 12 feet long, he felt, measuring\r\n  the distance by the size of the room in which he sat. The rubber\r\n  was smoky gray in color and scattered over an area about 200 yards\r\n  in diameter.\r\n\r\n  When the debris was gathered up the tinfoil, paper, tape, and\r\n  sticks made a bundle about three feet long and 7 or 8 inches thick,\r\n  while the rubber made a bundle about 18 or 20 inches long and about\r\n  8 inches thick. In all, he estimated, the entire lot would have\r\n  weighed maybe five pounds.\r\n\r\n  There was no sign of any metal in the area which might have been\r\n  used for an engine and no sign of any propellers of any kind,\r\n  although at least one paper fin had been glued onto some of the\r\n  tinfoil.\r\n\r\n  There were no words to be found anywhere on the instrument,\r\n  although there were letters on some of the parts. Considerable\r\n  scotch tape and some tape with flowers printed upon it had been\r\n  used in the construction.\r\n\r\n  No strings or wire were to be found but there were some eyelets in\r\n  the paper to indicate that some sort of attachment may have been\r\n  used.\r\n\r\n  Brazel said that he had previously found two weather observation\r\n  balloons on the ranch, but that what he found this time did not in\r\n  any way resemble either of these.\r\n\r\n  “I am sure what I found was not any weather observation balloon.”\r\n  he said. “But if I find anything else, besides a bomb they are\r\n  going to have a hard time getting me to say anything about it.”]\r\n\r\nIn response to the newspaper announcement, two scientists central to\r\nthe actual explanation of the “Roswell” events, Professor Charles\r\nB. Moore, a former U.S. Army Air Forces contract engineer, and\r\nBernard D. Gildenberg, retired Holloman AFB Balloon Branch Physical\r\nScience Administrator and Meteorologist, came forward with pertinent\r\ninformation.[9] According to Moore and Gildenberg, when they met with\r\nthe authors their explanations that some of the Air Force projects they\r\nparticipated in were most likely responsible for the incident, they\r\nwere summarily dismissed. The authors even went so far as to suggest\r\nthat these distinguished scientists were participants in a multifaceted\r\ngovernment cover-up to conceal the truth about the Roswell Incident.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 8.

When former Air Force scientists\r\n  responded to advise the authors that Air Force projects were most\r\n  probably responsible for the UFO accounts, they were summarily\r\n  dismissed by the authors who placed the announcement, and then were\r\n  accused of participating in a cover-up.\r\n\r\n  _Authors seek UFO witnesses_\r\n\r\n  Co-authors of a major book on the 1947 crash of at least one\r\n  alien spacecraft in the New Mexico desert will be at the Golden\r\n  Manor Motel in Socorro on Monday, Nov. 16 to seek out additional\r\n  witnesses to these events.\r\n\r\n  Nuclear physicist Stanton T.

It is the story of the\r\n  discovery, retrieval, shipping and cover-up of what the authors\r\n  call the most important scientific discovery of the past thousand\r\n  years.\r\n\r\n  It is based on dozens of interviews with first- and second-hand\r\n  civilian and ex-military witnesses to various parts of what is\r\n  referred to as a very complex series of events.\r\n\r\n  In order to strengthen their case for government knowledge of what\r\n  they call “the truth behind almost 50 years of UFO sightings,” the\r\n  authors are seeking out additional, reliable witnesses. It remains\r\n  their policy to honor requests to keep the names of witnesses\r\n  private.\r\n\r\n  For more information, contact Don Berliner, 1202 S. Washington St.,\r\n  Alexandria.

Gildenberg actively participated in thousands of\r\n  high altitude balloon operations, including the flights that\r\n  dropped anthropomorphic dummies at off-range locations throughout\r\n  New Mexico. Gildenberg, the “father” of Air Force scientific\r\n  ballooning, was instrumental in identifying the many actual Air\r\n  Force activities now known as the “Roswell Incident.”]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 10. (_Right_) Charles B. Moore, Professor\r\n  Emeritus of Atmospheric Physics at the New Mexico Institute of\r\n  Mining and Technology, was the project engineer for New York\r\n  University under contract to the U.S. Army Air Forces to develop\r\n  high altitude balloon technology for Project MOGUL. Moore launched\r\n  the balloon train on June 4, 1947, that when combined with other\r\n  events, are now known as the “Roswell Incident.”]\r\n\r\nSince many of the Roswell accounts and allegations were collected by\r\nirregular methods and are not specifically documented, the series\r\nof events as alleged by UFO theorists has become very complex and\r\nrequires clarification. Therefore, the following section will briefly\r\nexamine some of the more confusing elements of the Roswell stories,\r\nspecifically, the multiple crash sites and complex scenarios, in order\r\nto facilitate an objective analysis of actual events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  1.1\r\n          The “Crash Sites,” Scenarios, and Research Methods\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Crash Sites”\r\n\r\nFrom 1947 until the late 1970s, the Roswell Incident was confined\r\nto one alleged crash site. This site, located on the Foster Ranch\r\napproximately 75 miles northwest of the city of Roswell, was the actual\r\nlanding site of a Project MOGUL balloon train in June 1947.[10] The\r\nMOGUL landing site is referred to in popular Roswell literature as the\r\n“debris field.”\r\n\r\nIn the 1970s, the 1980s and throughout the 1990s, additional witnesses\r\ncame forward with claims and descriptions of two other alleged crash\r\nsites. One of these sites was supposedly north of Roswell, the other\r\nsite was alleged to have been approximately 175 miles northwest of\r\nRoswell in an area of New Mexico known as the San Agustin Plains.[11]\r\nWhat distinguished the two new crash sites from the original debris\r\nfield were accounts of alien bodies.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 11. Map of New Mexico depicting the “crash\r\n  sites” and “debris field.” ]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Scenarios\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: “_It must be emphasized that the claims of bodies only\r\n  became part of the Roswell Incident after 1978, when they were\r\n  erroneously linked to the July 1947 retrieval of Project MOGUL\r\n  components._”]\r\n\r\nUFO enthusiasts have attempted to explain the obvious contradiction\r\nof multiple impact sites involving only one alien craft through the\r\nintroduction of complicated scenarios. These scenarios have become\r\nincreasingly convoluted since the proponents of each crash site must\r\nmake allowances to have “their” flying saucer at the correct time\r\nand place—the actual MOGUL balloon train landing site in early July,\r\n1947—in order to “fit” with the rest of the story. The actual Project\r\nMOGUL landing site, 75 miles northwest of Roswell, lends credibility,\r\nand more importantly establishes a _time frame_, for the other accounts\r\nthat include reports of bodies. Flying saucer enthusiasts use the\r\ndocumented presence of U.S. Army Air Forces personnel at the MOGUL\r\nsite in July 1947, who were there to retrieve the MOGUL balloon train,\r\nto provide the nucleus of unrelated and much later accounts that\r\ninclude reports of “bodies.” It must be emphasized that the claims of\r\n“bodies” only became part of the Roswell Incident after 1978, when they\r\nwere erroneously linked to the July 1947 retrieval of Project MOGUL\r\ncomponents.\r\n\r\nIn general, “Roswell Incident” scenarios claim that a disabled alien\r\ncraft momentarily touched down at the site 75 miles northwest of\r\nRoswell, leaving behind parts of the spaceship (material that has been\r\nsubsequently identified as components of a MOGUL balloon train) to\r\ncreate the original “debris field.” The scenarios further contend that\r\nthe damaged craft again became airborne and flew to its final crash\r\nsite, at either the location north of Roswell or 175 miles northwest of\r\nRoswell on the San Agustin Plains.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the dispute over the location, an element common to\r\nmost scenarios was that, once recovered, the bodies were supposedly\r\ntransported to the hospital at Roswell Army Air Field for autopsy. Also\r\ncommon to these theories is that the bodies were later shipped from\r\nRoswell AAF to another facility, usually Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio (or\r\na host of other facilities—this is another area of further disagreement\r\namong UFO theorists) for further evaluation and ultimate deep-freeze\r\nstorage.\r\n\r\n\r\nResearch Methods\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to untangle this collection of complicated assertions and\r\ndetermine if there was any validity to the reports of bodies, Air Force\r\nresearchers faced the task of sorting through and examining anecdotal\r\ntestimony of hundreds of witnesses. However, a large number of the\r\naccounts were eliminated by applying previously established facts to\r\nthe testimonies. The July 1994 report to the Secretary of the Air Force\r\nclearly presented and documented these facts:\r\n\r\n  _a._ The U.S. Army Air Forces did not recover an extraterrestrial\r\n  vehicle and alien crew. This conclusion was based on extensive\r\n  research that included a thorough review of both classified\r\n  and unclassified materials at record depositories, archives,\r\n  libraries and research facilities throughout the nation. Of the\r\n  millions of pages of material reviewed, there was no mention of\r\n  any activities that even tangentially suggested such an event.\r\n  Additionally, former and retired Air Force members and civilian\r\n  contract scientists were located and released from any possible\r\n  nondisclosure agreements they may have entered into regarding\r\n  past classified activities. This release allowed them to freely\r\n  discuss with Air Force researchers, or any other persons,\r\n  information related to this issue. These releases were issued at\r\n  the express written direction of the Secretary of the Air Force.\r\n  Interviews with these persons yielded no information supporting\r\n  extraterrestrial claims or any other unusual activities.\r\n\r\n  _b._ The reports of bodies were not associated with Project MOGUL.\r\n  The MOGUL balloon train did not, was not designed to, nor could it\r\n  carry passengers. Neither did it carry hazardous materials that\r\n  would have caused injury, death, or mutilation to persons who may\r\n  have come in contact with any of its components.\r\n\r\n  _c._ Actual events, if any, that inspired reports of bodies did\r\n  not occur in 1947. Based on extensive examinations of U.S. Army\r\n  Air Forces activities in 1947, no evidence was found to support\r\n  allegations that the Army Air Forces was involved in any uncommon\r\n  operations other than the retrieval of the MOGUL balloon train\r\n  in the Roswell area in July 1947. Examination of research and\r\n  development projects, aircraft crashes, errant missiles and\r\n  possible nuclear accidents yielded no information to support a 1947\r\n  claim.\r\n\r\nIn light of these documented facts, the hundreds of anecdotal accounts\r\nwere reduced to a few. Eliminated were accounts that were likely\r\ndescriptions of materials known to be part of the Project MOGUL balloon\r\ntrain and accounts describing transportation of these materials.\r\n\r\nFrom the remaining testimony, Air Force researchers developed the\r\nfollowing set of working hypotheses to assist in identifying the actual\r\nevents, if any, matching those described by the witnesses.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Due to the number and great detail provided in some of the\r\n  accounts, it was likely that some event(s) actually did occur.\r\n\r\n  _b._ Due to the many similarities of the two crash site\r\n  descriptions and the considerable distance between them, it was\r\n  likely that more than one event with similar characteristics was\r\n  the basis for these accounts.\r\n\r\n  _c._ Since the account of bodies at the Roswell Army Air Field\r\n  hospital did not contain elements similar to reports of the two\r\n  crash sites, it was likely that this account was unrelated to\r\n  the crash site accounts. (The hospital account will be addressed\r\n  separately in Section Two of this report.)\r\n\r\nThe remaining testimony was examined with regard both to the facts and\r\nto working hypotheses to determine if there were common threads or\r\nlinks connecting any of the accounts. If similarities were found, the\r\nnext step was to determine if they were related to an actual event.\r\nFinally, if there were actual event(s), were they part of U.S. Air\r\nForce or U.S. Government activities?\r\n\r\n\r\nCommon Threads\r\n\r\nCareful examination of the testimony revealed that primary witnesses\r\nof the two “crashed saucer” locations contained descriptions common to\r\nboth. These areas of commonality contained both general and detailed\r\ncharacteristics. However, before continuing, the accounts were\r\ncarefully examined to determine if the testimony related by individual\r\nwitnesses were of their own experiences and not a recitation of\r\ninformation given by other persons. While many aspects of the remaining\r\naccounts were judged to be similar, other aspects were found to be\r\nsignificantly different. The accounts on which the analysis is based\r\nwere determined, in all likelihood, to have been independently obtained\r\nor observed by the witnesses.\r\n\r\n=General Similarities.= The testimony presented for both crash sites\r\ngenerally followed the same sequence of events. The witnesses were\r\nin a rural and isolated area of New Mexico. In the course of their\r\ntravels in this area, they came upon a crashed aerial vehicle. The\r\nwitnesses then proceeded to the area of the crash to investigate and at\r\nsome distance they observed strange looking “beings” that appeared to\r\nbe crewmembers of the vehicle. Soon thereafter, a convoy of military\r\nvehicles and soldiers arrived at the site. Military personnel allegedly\r\ninstructed the civilians to leave the area and forget what they had\r\nseen. As the witnesses left the area, the military personnel commenced\r\nwith a recovery operation of the crashed aerial vehicle and “crew.”\r\n\r\n=Detailed Similarities.= Along with general similarities in the\r\ntestimonies, there also existed a substantial amount of similar\r\ndetailed descriptions of the “aliens,” and the military vehicles and\r\nprocedures allegedly used to recover them.\r\n\r\nThe first obvious similarity was the descriptions of the aliens.\r\nMr. Gerald Anderson, an alleged witness of events at the site 175\r\nmiles northwest of Roswell, recalled, “I thought they were plastic\r\ndolls.”[12] Mr. James Ragsdale, an alleged witness of the site north of\r\nRoswell, stated, “They were using dummies in those damned things.”[13]\r\nAnother alleged witness to a “crash” north of Roswell, Frank J.\r\nKaufman, recalled that there was “talk” that perhaps an “experimental\r\nplane with dummies in it” was the source of the claims.[14]\r\n\r\nAdditional similarities were also noted. Mr. Vern Maltais, a secondhand\r\nwitness of the site 175 miles northwest of Roswell, described the\r\nhands of the “aliens” as, “They had four fingers.”[15] Anderson\r\ncharacterized the hands as, “They didn’t have a little finger.”[16]\r\nHe also described the heads of the aliens as “completely bald”[17]\r\nwhile Maltais described them as “hairless.”[18] The uniforms of the\r\naliens were independently described by Anderson as “one-piece suits\r\n... a shiny silverish-gray color”[19] and by Maltais as “one-piece\r\nand gray in color.”[20] The date of this event was also not precisely\r\nknown. Maltais recalled that it may have occurred “around 1950”[21] and\r\nanother secondhand witness, Alice Knight stated, “I don’t recall the\r\ndate.”[22]\r\n\r\nWitnesses of different sites also used the terms “wrecker”[23] and\r\n“six-by-six”[24] when they described the military vehicles present at\r\nthe different recovery sites. One witness described seeing a “medium\r\nsized Jeep/truck”[25] and another witness described seeing a “weapons\r\ncarrier”[26] (a weapons carrier is a mid-sized Jeep-type truck).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Research Profile\r\n\r\nWhen the general and specific similarities were combined, a profile\r\nemerged describing the event or activity that might have been observed.\r\nThe profile, which contains elements common to at least two, and in\r\nsome cases, all of the accounts, established a set of criteria used\r\nto determine what the witnesses may have observed. The profile is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  _a._ An activity that, if viewed from a distance, would appear\r\n  unusual.\r\n\r\n  _b._ An activity of which the exact date is not known.\r\n\r\n  _c._ An activity that took place in two rural areas of New Mexico.\r\n\r\n  _d._ An activity that involved a type of aerial vehicle with dolls\r\n  or dummies that had four fingers, were bald, and wore one-piece\r\n  gray suits.\r\n\r\n  _e._ An activity that required recovery by numerous military\r\n  personnel and an assortment of vehicles that included a wrecker, a\r\n  six-by-six, and a weapons carrier.\r\n\r\nBased on this profile, research was begun to identify events or\r\nactivities with these characteristics. Due to the location of the\r\nsites, attention was focused on Roswell AAF (renamed Walker AFB in\r\n1948), White Sands Missile Range and Holloman AFB, N.M. The aerial\r\nvehicles assigned or under development at these facilities were\r\naircraft, missiles, remotely-piloted drones, and high altitude\r\nballoons. The operational characteristics and areas where these\r\nvehicles flew were researched to determine if they played a role in the\r\nevents described by the witnesses.\r\n\r\n=Missiles and Drones.= Missiles and drones were determined not to have\r\nbeen responsible for the accounts.[*] The areas where the alleged\r\ncrashes took place were, in all likelihood, too far from the White\r\nSands Missile Range. Missiles were equipped with a self-destruct\r\nmechanism that was activated if it strayed off-course or out of the\r\nWhite Sands Missile Range. There was never a program that required\r\na dummy or doll to be placed inside a missile or a drone. However,\r\nmissiles were launched from White Sands carrying monkeys and other\r\nsmall animals aloft for scientific research.[27] These projects were\r\nwell documented, and none of these missiles landed near either of the\r\ntwo crash sites.\r\n\r\n  [*] From September 1961 until March 1965 12 Atlas F\r\n  intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) were deployed by the\r\n  579^{th} Strategic Missile Squadron in areas surrounding Walker\r\n  AFB, N.M. These missiles were determined not to have been involved\r\n  in the Roswell Incident.\r\n\r\n=Aircraft.= Aircraft seemed just as unlikely as missiles to have been\r\nresponsible for the extraterrestrial claims as outlined in the profile.\r\nAlthough additional research revealed the significant role dummies\r\nplayed in the test and evaluation of aircraft emergency escape systems,\r\nthese dummies were used on board aircraft and on the high-speed test\r\ntrack at Holloman AFB. However, aircraft test flights demanded strict\r\nadherence to established flight profiles over the instrumented portions\r\nof the White Sands Missile Range, many miles from the alleged crash\r\nsites. Dummies used on the high-speed track remained in the immediate\r\nvicinity of the track facilities at Holloman AFB. This geographical\r\nimpossibility ruled out dummies that were ejected from aircraft\r\nand those used on the high-speed track as a cause of alleged alien\r\nsightings. (Aircraft accidents will be discussed extensively in Section\r\nTwo of this report.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Figs. 12 & 13. Missiles (_left_) and drones\r\n  (_right_) under development at Holloman AFB, N.M. were determined\r\n  not to have been involved in the “Roswell Incident.” (_U.S. Air\r\n  Force photos_)]\r\n\r\n=High Altitude Research Balloons.= The only vehicles not yet evaluated\r\nas a possible source of the accounts were high altitude research\r\nballoons. Previous reviews of early research balloon flight records\r\nrevealed that trajectories of high altitude balloons were, at times,\r\nunpredictable and did not usually remain over Holloman AFB or White\r\nSands Missile Range.[28] Many of the scientific payloads required\r\nrecovery so the data collected during flight could be returned to the\r\nlaboratory for analysis.\r\n\r\nThese characteristics seemed to fit at least some of the research\r\nprofile. Atmospheric sampling apparatus or weather instruments, the\r\ntypical payload of many high altitude balloons, could hardly have been\r\nmistaken for space aliens. A careful examination of the instruments\r\ncarried aloft by the high altitude balloons revealed that one unique\r\nproject used a device that very likely could be mistaken for an\r\nalien—an anthropomorphic dummy.\r\n\r\nAn anthropomorphic dummy is a human substitute equipped with a variety\r\nof instrumentation to measure effects of environments and situations\r\ndeemed too hazardous for a human. These abstractly human dummies\r\nwere first used in New Mexico in May 1950, and have been used on a\r\ncontinuous basis since that time.[29]\r\n\r\nIn the 1950s, anthropomorphic dummies were not widely exposed outside\r\nof scientific research circles and easily could have been mistaken for\r\nsomething they were not. Today, anthropomorphic dummies, better known\r\nas crash test dummies, are easily identifiable and are even the “stars”\r\nof their own automotive safety advertising campaign. During the 1950s\r\nwhen the U.S. Air Force dropped the odd-looking test devices from high\r\naltitude balloons in its program to study high altitude human free-fall\r\ncharacteristics, public awareness and stardom were decades away. It\r\nseems likely that someone who unexpectedly observed these dummies at a\r\ndistance would believe they had seen something unusual. In retrospect,\r\nwhen interviewed over 40 years later, they could accurately report that\r\nthey had seen something _very unusual_.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of anthropomorphic dummies as a possible\r\nexplanation for the reports of bodies, another element of the research\r\nprofile appeared to be satisfied. Specific information that described\r\nthe locations, methods, and procedures used to employ the dummies was\r\nrequired before any definitive conclusions could be drawn. To gather\r\nthis detailed information, research efforts were concentrated on high\r\naltitude balloon operations and the specific projects that utilized\r\nballoon-borne anthropomorphic dummies.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 14. (_Left_) Example of an anthropomorphic\r\n  dummy carried aloft by U.S. Air Force high altitude balloons. These\r\n  dummies landed at numerous locations throughout New Mexico during\r\n  the 1950s.

Early\r\ndevices used by the predecessors of the U.S. Air Force were simply\r\nconstructed parachute drop test dummies with little similarity to the\r\nhuman form. Following World War II, aircraft emergency escape systems\r\nbecame increasingly sophisticated and engineers required a dummy with\r\nmore humanlike characteristics.\r\n\r\n\r\nParachute Drop Dummies\r\n\r\nDuring World War I research and development of the first U.S. military\r\nparachute was underway at McCook Field, Ohio. To test the parachute,\r\nengineers experimented with several types of dummies, settling on\r\na model constructed of three-inch hemp rope and sandbags with the\r\napproximate proportions of a medium-sized man.[30] The new invention\r\nwas soon known by the nickname “Dummy Joe.” Dummy Joe is said to have\r\nmade more than five thousand “jumps” between 1918 and 1924.[31]\r\n\r\nBy 1924, parachutes were required on military aircraft with their\r\nserviceability tested by dummies dropped from aircraft.[32] For this\r\nroutine testing, several types of dummies were used. The most common\r\ntype is shown in figures 17 and 18. Parachutes were individually\r\ndrop-tested from aircraft until the early stages of World War II, when,\r\ndue both to increased reliability and large numbers of parachutes in\r\nservice, this routine practice was discontinued. Nonetheless, test\r\ndummies were still used frequently by the Parachute Branch of Air\r\nMateriel Command (AMC) at Wright Field, Ohio, to test new parachute\r\ndesigns.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 16. “‘Dummy Joe,’ the hero of five thousand\r\n  jumps” is shown here with engineers J.J. Higgins (_left_) and Guy\r\n  Ball at McCook Field, Ohio in 1920. (_U.S. Air Force photo_)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 17. (_Left_) Early rope and sandbag dummy used\r\n  to test parachutes.

(_U.S. Air Force photo_)]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnthropomorphic Dummies\r\n\r\nThe ejection seat had been developed and used successfully by the\r\nGerman Luftwaffe during the latter stages of World War II. The utility\r\nof this invention was realized when the U.S. Army Air Forces obtained\r\nan ejection seat in 1944.[33] To properly test the ejection seat, the\r\nArmy Air Forces required a dummy that had the same center of gravity\r\nand weight distribution as a human, characteristics that parachute\r\ndrop dummies did not possess. In 1944, the USAAF Air Materiel Command\r\ncontracted with the Ted Smith Company of Upper Darby, Pa. to design\r\nand manufacture the first dummy intended to accurately represent a\r\nhuman.[34] The dummy had the same basic shape as a human, but with only\r\nabstract human features, and “skin” made of canvas.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Figs. 19 & 20. (_Left & Right_) These early\r\n  anthropomorphic dummies, manufactured by the Ted Smith Co., of\r\n  Upper Darby, Pa., were used by the Army Air Forces beginning in\r\n  1944. They were replaced by a more realistic dummy in 1949.\r\n\r\n  (_Right_) “Oscar Eightball,” the name given to this early model\r\n  anthropomorphic dummy by Col. John P. Stapp, is shown following a\r\n  run of the high-speed track at Muroc AAF (now Edwards AFB), Calif.,\r\n  in 1947. (_U.S. Air Force photos_)]\r\n\r\nIn 1949, the U.S. Air Force Aero Medical Laboratory submitted a\r\nproposal for an improved model of the anthropomorphic dummy.[35]\r\nThis request was originated by the renowned Air Force scientist and\r\nphysician John P. Stapp, now a retired Colonel, who conducted a series\r\nof landmark experiments at Muroc (now Edwards) AFB, Calif., to measure\r\nthe effects of acceleration and deceleration during high-speed aircraft\r\nejections.[36] Stapp required a dummy that had the same center of\r\ngravity and articulation as a human, but, unlike the Ted Smith dummy,\r\nwas more human in appearance. A more accurate external appearance was\r\nrequired to provide for the proper fit of helmets, oxygen masks, and\r\nother equipment used during the tests. Stapp requested the Anthropology\r\nBranch of the Aero Medical Laboratory at Wright Field to review\r\nanthropological, orthopedic, and engineering literature to prepare\r\nspecifications for the new dummy.[37] Plaster casts of the torso, legs,\r\nand arms of an Air Force pilot were also taken to assure accuracy.[38]\r\nThe result was a proposed dummy that stood 72 inches tall, weighed\r\n200 pounds, had provisions for mounting instrumentation, and could\r\nwithstand up to 100 times the force of gravity or 100Gs.\r\n\r\nIn 1949, a contract was awarded to Sierra Engineering Company of Sierra\r\nMadre, Calif., and deliveries began in 1950.[39] This dummy quickly\r\nbecame known as “Sierra Sam.”\r\n\r\nIn 1952, a contract for anthropomorphic dummies was awarded to Alderson\r\nResearch Laboratories, Inc., of New York City.[40] Dummies constructed\r\nby both companies possessed the same basic characteristics: a skeleton\r\nof aluminum or steel, latex or plastic skin, a cast aluminum skull, and\r\nan instrument cavity in the torso and head for the mounting of strain\r\ngauges, accelerometers, transducers, and rate gyros.[41] Models used by\r\nthe Air Force were primarily parachute drop and ejection seat versions\r\nwith center of gravity tolerances within one quarter inch.\r\n\r\nOver the next several years the two companies improved and redesigned\r\ninternal structures and instrumentation, but the basic external\r\nappearance of the dummies remained relatively constant from the mid\r\n1950s to the late 1960s. Dummies of these types were most likely the\r\n“aliens” associated with the “Roswell Incident.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Figs. 21 & 22.

Project HIGH DIVE anthropomorphic dummy\r\n  launch, White Sands Proving Ground, N.M., June 11, 1957. (_U.S. Air\r\n  Force photo_)]\r\n\r\nAnthropomorphic dummies were transported to altitudes up to 98,000 feet\r\nby high altitude balloons. The dummies were then released for a period\r\nof free-fall while body movements and escape equipment performance were\r\nrecorded by a variety of instruments. Forty-three high altitude balloon\r\nflights carrying 67 anthropomorphic dummies were launched and recovered\r\nthroughout New Mexico between June 1954 and February 1959.[44] Due\r\nto prevailing wind conditions, operational factors and ruggedness of\r\nthe terrain, the majority of dummies impacted outside the confines\r\nof military reservations in eastern New Mexico, near Roswell, and in\r\nareas surrounding the Tularosa Valley in south central New Mexico.[45]\r\nAdditionally, 30 dummies were dropped by aircraft over White Sands\r\nProving Ground, N.M. in 1953. In 1959, 150 dummies were dropped by\r\naircraft over Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio (possibly accounting for\r\nalleged alien “sightings” at that location).[46]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Anthropomorphic Dummy Launch and Landing Locations]\r\n\r\nA number of these launch and recovery locations were in the areas where\r\nthe “crashed saucer” and “space aliens” were allegedly observed.\r\n\r\nFollowing the series of dummy tests, a human subject, test pilot Capt.\r\nJoseph W. Kittinger, Jr., now a retired Colonel, made three parachute\r\njumps from high altitude balloons. Since free-fall tests from these\r\nunprecedented altitudes were extremely hazardous, they could not\r\nbe accomplished by a human until a rigorous testing program using\r\nanthropomorphic dummies was completed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 25. “Lord, take care of me now,” were Capt.\r\n  Joseph W. Kittinger, Jr.’s words as he exited the EXCELSIOR III\r\n  balloon gondola at 102,800 feet on August 16, 1960, over White\r\n  Sands Proving Ground, N.M.

These included a book written by test pilot\r\nKittinger, _The Long, Lonely Leap_, another book, _Man High_, by MAN\r\nHIGH Project Scientist, Lt. Col. David G.

More than 18½ miles below lay the\r\n  cloud-hidden New Mexico desert to which I shortly would parachute.\r\n\r\n  Sitting in my gondola, which gently twisted with the balloon’s slow\r\n  turnings, I had begun to sweat lightly, though the temperature read\r\n  36° below zero Fahrenheit. Sunlight burned in on me under the edge\r\n  of an aluminized antiglare curtain and through the gondola’s open\r\n  door.\r\n\r\n  In my earphones crackled the voice of Capt. Marvin Feldstein, one\r\n  of our project’s two doctors, from ground control at Holloman Air\r\n  Force Base:\r\n\r\n  “Three minutes till jump, Joe.”\r\n\r\n  I was ready to go, for more reasons than one. For about an hour—as\r\n  the balloon rose from 50,000 to 102,800 feet above sea level—I\r\n  had been exposed to an environment requiring the protection of a\r\n  pressure suit and helmet, and the fear of their failure had always\r\n  been present. If either should break, unconsciousness would come in\r\n  10 or 12 seconds, and death within two minutes.\r\n\r\n  In our altitude-chamber flights at the laboratory, I always\r\n\r\n  “=Lord, take care of me now=,” I pray, then take the big step-off\r\n  that begins my return from the edge of space, a 13-minute,\r\n  45-second plunge to an earth wrapped in clouds. The lanyard\r\n  attached to my parachute pack is my last link with the gondola.\r\n  It starts a timer on a small stabilization chute that will\r\n  open 16 seconds later and prevent horizontal spinning. Without\r\n  stabilization, man could not survive a jump from these high\r\n  altitudes.\r\n\r\n  A National Geographic camera mounted above the gondola took this\r\n  remarkable photograph at 102,800 feet.\r\n\r\n  MS Ektachrome National Geographic Society\r\n]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 27.

This equipment consisted\r\nof a one-piece flightsuit, olive drab, gray (witnesses had described\r\nseeing aliens in gray one-piece suits) or fuchsia in color, boots,\r\nand a parachute pack.[51] The dummies were also fitted with an\r\ninstrumentation kit that contained accelerometers, pressure\r\ntransducers, an oscillograph, and a camera to record movements of the\r\ndummy during free-fall.[52]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 30.

(_U.S. Air Force_)]\r\n\r\nRecoveries of the test dummies were accomplished by personnel from\r\nthe Holloman AFB Balloon Branch.[53] Typically, eight to twelve\r\ncivilian and military recovery personnel arrived at the site of an\r\nanthropomorphic dummy landing as soon as possible following impact.\r\nThe recovery crews operated a variety of aircraft and vehicles.\r\nThese included a wrecker, a six-by-six, a weapons carrier, and L-20\r\nobservation and C-47 transport aircraft—the exact vehicles and aircraft\r\ndescribed by the witnesses as having been present at the crashed saucer\r\nlocations.[54] On one occasion, just southwest of Roswell, a HIGH DIVE\r\nproject officer, 1st Lt. Raymond A. Madson, even conducted a search for\r\ndummies on horseback[55] (see statement in Appendix B).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 31. An M-35 2½-ton cargo truck, commonly\r\n  referred to as a “six-by-six,” were used by the Holloman Balloon\r\n  Branch to launch and recover anthropomorphic dummies and suspension\r\n  racks at numerous locations throughout New Mexico.

To assist the recovery\r\npersonnel, a variety of methods were used to enhance the visibility\r\nof the dummies: smoke grenades, pigment powder, and brightly colored\r\nparachute canopies.[58] Also, recovery notices promising a $25 reward\r\nwere taped to an exposed portion of a dummy.[59] Local newspapers and\r\nradio stations were contacted when equipment was lost.[60]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            The Bravest Man\r\n\r\n  America was introduced to Col. John Paul Stapp on December 10,\r\n  1954, when he became known as both the “the bravest” and “the\r\n  fastest” man on earth. Stapp earned these titles following a\r\n  rocket sled test that accelerated him to 632 miles per hour. He\r\n  reached this speed in just five seconds—faster than a .45 caliber\r\n  bullet—and was decelerated to a stop in 1.4 seconds, subjecting\r\n  his body to more than 42 times the force of gravity! While this\r\n  was America’s introduction to Col. Stapp, the 1954 rocket sled\r\n  test that examined aircraft restraint devices and human responses\r\n  to accelerative/decelerative forces and windblast, was just one of\r\n  many achievements of this legendary Air Force physician.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 33.

Stapp (now a retired Colonel) being strapped into the rocket\r\n  sled Sonic Wind Nᵒ 1, on December 10, 1954, at Holloman AFB, N.M.\r\n  Courageously, Stapp was his own volunteer subject on 29 rocket sled\r\n  tests and earned two awards of the Legion of Merit and the Cheney\r\n  Award for valor and self-sacrifice. (_U.S. Air Force photo_)]\r\n\r\n  Born in Bahia, Brazil to American missionary parents, Stapp sold\r\n  pots and pans door to door during the Depression while he earned\r\n  both undergraduate and graduate degrees in zoology and chemistry\r\n  at Baylor University. He went on to earn a doctorate in biophysics\r\n  from the University of Texas, and a doctorate in medicine from the\r\n  University of Minnesota.\r\n\r\n  In 1944 Stapp entered the U.S. Army Air Forces and became\r\n  a flight surgeon. From 1946 to 1963, due to his unique\r\n  qualifications in biophysics and medicine, he conducted a series\r\n  of acceleration/deceleration experiments on the high-speed track\r\n  at Muroc (now Edwards AFB), Calif.,[61] and later at Holloman\r\n  AFB, N.M. Developments from these and other studies resulted in\r\n  innovations which have saved many lives. These included improved\r\n  safety belt restraint systems and design specifications for\r\n  aircraft and automobiles, aircraft ejection and emergency escape\r\n  systems, refinement of automobile airbag systems, and development\r\n  of the modern anthropomorphic test dummy.\r\n\r\n  As commander of the U.S. Air Force Aeromedical Field Laboratory\r\n  at Holloman AFB, N.M. and later the Aero Medical Laboratory at\r\n  Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, Stapp won support for the Air Force\r\n  manned high altitude balloons projects—MAN HIGH and EXCELSIOR. As\r\n  a testament to his thorough safety preparations, these and other\r\n  extremely hazardous projects administered by Stapp, did not result\r\n  in a single debilitating injury to a test subject. These projects\r\n  helped pave the way for future flights of both high altitude\r\n  aircraft such as the X-15, and of spacecraft for the MERCURY,\r\n  GEMINI, and APOLLO programs. In fact, Stapp’s expertise was called\r\n  upon to assist in the selection of the initial cadre of astronauts,\r\n  the “MERCURY Seven.”\r\n\r\n  He retired from the Air Force in 1970, but not before amassing a\r\n  collection of awards and honors. These included two awards of the\r\n  Legion of Merit for rocket sled experiments, the Cheney Award for\r\n  1954, and membership in the National Aviation Hall of Fame.\r\n\r\n  In association with the Society of Automotive Engineers, Stapp\r\n  continues to participate in annual conferences in which industry\r\n  experts assemble to discuss vehicle safety issues. The conferences,\r\n  now in their 40th year bear his name: the Stapp Car Crash\r\n  Conferences.\r\n\r\n  In 1991, in recognition of a lifetime of unselfish dedication\r\n  to scientific research, Stapp was awarded the National Medal of\r\n  Technology, bestowed upon him at the White House by President\r\n  George Bush.\r\n\r\n  He is married to the former Lillian Lanese, a former soloist with\r\n  the Ballet Theater of New York, and resides in Alamogordo, N.M. At\r\n  87 years old he continues to maintain a dizzying pace of travel and\r\n  lectures.\r\n\r\n  It is not an exaggeration that virtually every person who has\r\n  safely operated, or ridden in, an automobile, aircraft, or\r\n  spacecraft, has benefited from the genius of Col. John Paul Stapp,\r\n  and owes this brave scientist, physician, and visionary, a great\r\n  deal of thanks.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 34. September 12, 1955 edition of _Time_\r\n  featuring Col.

The dummies were\r\nsometimes transported to and from off-range locations in wooden\r\nshipping containers, similar to caskets, to prevent damage to fragile\r\ninstruments mounted in and on the dummy.[65] Also, canvas military\r\nstretchers and hospital gurneys were used (a procedure recommended by a\r\ndummy manufacturer) to move the dummies in the laboratory or retrieve\r\ndummies in the field after a test.[66] The first 10 dummy drops also\r\nutilized black or silver insulation bags, similar to “body bags” in\r\nwhich the dummies were placed for flight to guard against equipment\r\nfailure at low ambient temperatures of the upper atmosphere.[67]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 40. Air Force personnel used stretchers and\r\n  gurneys to pick up 200-pound dummies in the field and to move them\r\n  in the laboratory. (_U.S. Air Force photo_)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 41. For the first 10 balloon flights, dummies\r\n  were placed in insulation bags to protect temperature-sensitive\r\n  equipment. These bags may have been described by at least one\r\n  witness as “body bags” used to recover alien victims from the crash\r\n  of a flying saucer. (_U.S. Air Force photo_)]\r\n\r\nOn one occasion northwest of Roswell, a local woman unfamiliar with the\r\ntest activities arrived at a dummy landing site prior to the arrival of\r\nthe recovery personnel.[68] The woman saw what appeared to be a human\r\nembedded head first in a snowbank and became hysterical. The woman\r\nscreamed, “He’s dead!, he’s dead!”[69]\r\n\r\nIt now appeared that anthropomorphic dummies dropped by high altitude\r\nballoons satisfied the requirements of the research profile. However,\r\nthe review of high altitude balloon operations revealed what appeared\r\nto be explanations for some other sightings of odd objects in the\r\ndeserts and skies of New Mexico.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Figs. 42 & 43.

When these\r\ndescriptions were carefully examined, it was clear that they bore more\r\nthan just a resemblance to Air Force activities. It appears that some\r\nwere actually distorted references to Air Force personnel and equipment\r\nengaged in scientific study through the use of high altitude balloons.\r\n\r\nSince 1947, U.S. Air Force research organizations at Holloman AFB,\r\nN.M., have launched and recovered approximately 2,500 high altitude\r\nballoons. The Air Force organization that conducted most of these\r\nactivities, the Holloman Balloon Branch, launched a wide range of\r\nsophisticated, and from most perspectives, odd looking equipment into\r\nthe stratosphere above New Mexico. In fact, the =_very first_= high\r\naltitude data gathering balloon flight launched from Alamogordo Army\r\nAirfield (now Holloman AFB), N.M., on June 4, 1947, was found by the\r\nrancher and was the first of many unrelated events now collectively\r\nknown as the “Roswell Incident.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 44.

Starring Guy\r\n  Madison, John Hodiak, and Dean Jagger, this drama chronicled the\r\n  high altitude balloon experiments of projects HIGH DIVE/EXCELSIOR\r\n  and the high-speed track studies conducted by Col. John P. Stapp.\r\n  Filmed on location at Holloman AFB, Air Force personnel, high\r\n  altitude balloons, aircraft, vehicles, and other equipment,\r\n  including the actual anthropomorphic dummies responsible for\r\n  sightings of aliens, were used in the making of this film.\r\n\r\n  In an ironic twist, in 1990 the television program _Unsolved\r\n  Mysteries_, featured a segment on the Roswell Incident. The\r\n  program, hosted by actor Robert Stack, depicted a dramatized\r\n  version of the claims of “aliens,” space ships and mysterious\r\n  government recovery crews. Interestingly, a review of newspapers\r\n  from 1956 announcing the Hollywood premiere of _On the Threshold\r\n  of Space_, listed Stack among the persons scheduled to attend this\r\n  star-studded event.[70]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 45.

Stapp’s historic 1954 rocket\r\n  sled test was re-created for _On the Threshold of Space_ (_see\r\n  figure 33, page 31_).]\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh Altitude Polyethylene Research Balloons\r\n\r\nIn 1946, as a result of research conducted for project MOGUL,\r\nCharles B. Moore, a New York University graduate student working\r\nunder contract for the U.S. Army Air Forces, made a significant\r\ntechnological discovery: the use of polyethylene for high altitude\r\nballoon construction.[71] Polyethylene is a lightweight plastic that\r\ncan withstand stresses of a high altitude environment that differed\r\ndrastically from, and greatly exceeded, the capabilities of standard\r\nrubber weather balloons used previously. Moore’s discovery was a\r\nbreakthrough in technology. For the first time, scientists were able to\r\nmake detailed, sustained studies of the upper atmosphere. Polyethylene\r\nballoons, first produced in 1947 for Project MOGUL, are still widely\r\nused today for a host of scientific applications.\r\n\r\nHigh altitude polyethylene balloons and standard rubber weather\r\nballoons differ greatly in size, construction, and utility. The\r\ndifference between these two types of balloons historically has been\r\nthe subject of misunderstandings in that the term “weather balloon” is\r\noften used to describe both types of balloons.\r\n\r\nHigh altitude polyethylene balloons are used to transport scientific\r\npayloads of several pounds to several tons to altitudes of nearly\r\n200,000 feet. Polyethylene balloons do not increase in size and burst\r\nwith increases in volume as they rise, as do standard rubber weather\r\nballoons. They are launched with excess capacity to accommodate the\r\nincrease in volume. This characteristic of polyethylene balloons makes\r\nthem substantially more stable than rubber weather balloons and capable\r\nof sustained constant level flight, a requirement for most scientific\r\napplications.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 48. Relative sizes of a modern high altitude\r\n  polyethylene research balloon, an airliner, and a hot-air balloon.\r\n  Inaccurate characterizations of the giant high altitude research\r\n  balloons as “weather balloons” (which are typically 15 feet in\r\n  diameter) has historically been the source of confusion.

Modern\r\npolyethylene balloons, some as long as several football fields when\r\non the ground, expand at altitude to volumes large enough to contain\r\nmany jet airliners. Polyethylene balloons flown by the U.S. Air Force\r\nhave reached altitudes of 170,000 feet and lifted payloads of 15,000\r\npounds.[73]\r\n\r\nDuring the late 1940’s and 1950’s, a characteristic associated\r\nwith the large, newly invented, polyethylene balloons, was that\r\nthey were often misidentified as flying saucers.[74] During this\r\nperiod, polyethylene balloons launched from Holloman AFB, generated\r\nflying saucer reports on nearly every flight.[75] There were so many\r\nreports that police, broadcast radio, and newspaper accounts of these\r\nsightings were used by Holloman technicians to supplement early balloon\r\ntracking techniques.[76] Balloons launched at Holloman AFB generated\r\nan especially high number of reports due to the excellent visibility\r\nin the New Mexico region. Also, the balloons, flown at altitudes\r\nof approximately 100,000 feet, were illuminated before the earth\r\nduring the periods just after sunset and just before sunrise. In this\r\ninstance, receiving sunlight before the earth, the plastic balloons\r\nappeared as large bright objects against a dark sky. Also, with the\r\nrefractive and translucent qualities of polyethylene, the balloons\r\nappeared to change color, size, and shape.\r\n\r\nThe large balloons generated UFO reports based on their radar\r\ntracks.[77] This was due to large metallic payloads that weighed\r\nup to several tons and echoed radar returns not usually associated\r\nwith balloons. In later years, balloons were equipped with altitude\r\nand position reporting transponders and strobe lights that greatly\r\ndiminished the numbers of both visual and radar UFO sightings.\r\n\r\nOne classic misidentification of a Holloman balloon that was mistaken\r\nfor a UFO, was launched on October 27, 1953.[78] According to the\r\nfollowing account published in a widely distributed 1958 history of\r\nAir Force balloon operations, _Contributions of Balloon Operations to\r\nResearch and Development at the Air Force Missile Development Center\r\nHolloman Air Force Base, N. Mex. 1947–1958_, a suspected Holloman\r\nballoon was tracked both visually and by radar over London, England on\r\nNovember 3, 1953.\r\n\r\n“English accounts of the incident contained such statements as\r\n‘tremendous speed,’ ‘practically motionless,’ ‘circular or spherical\r\nand white in color,’ ‘emitting or reflecting a fierce light.’ Altitude\r\nwas reported as 61,000 feet—and as no research balloon had recently\r\nbeen sent up from Britain, there was ample room for local saucer\r\nenthusiasts to claim the ‘unidentified flying object’ as proof of their\r\ntheories. A much likelier explanation, however, is that this was really\r\nthe balloon launched from Holloman on 27 October.”[79]\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh Altitude Balloon Payloads\r\n\r\nOver the years, payloads transported by high altitude polyethylene\r\nballoons ranged from simple radio transmitters to anthropomorphic\r\ndummies to sophisticated satellite components and NASA interplanetary\r\nspace probes. Many of these payloads, some of which weighed many tons,\r\nwere not what someone would typically envision as being associated with\r\na balloon. Examples of payloads flown in New Mexico by Air Force high\r\naltitude balloons can be found on pages 52 and 53 at the end of this\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nResearch projects of the late 1940’s and 1950’s conducted at Holloman\r\nAFB which began with the Project MOGUL flights in June 1947, covered\r\na wide spectrum of scientific research. One important experiment\r\nin space biology measured the effects of exposure to cosmic ray\r\nparticles on living tissues.[80] Other projects gathered meteorological\r\ndata and collected air samples to determine the composition of the\r\natmosphere.[81] The first high altitude photographic reconnaissance\r\nproject, a forerunner to today’s reconnaissance satellites, Project\r\n119L, also used high altitude balloons launched at Holloman AFB.[82]\r\n\r\nAs early as May 1948, polyethylene balloons coated or laminated with\r\naluminum were flown from Holloman AFB and the surrounding area.[83]\r\nBeginning in August 1955, large numbers of these balloons were flown\r\nas targets in the development of radar guided air to air missiles.[84]\r\nVarious accounts of the “Roswell Incident” often described thin,\r\nmetal-like materials that when wadded into a ball, returned to their\r\noriginal shape. These accounts are consistent with the properties of\r\npolyethylene balloons laminated with aluminum. These balloons were\r\ntypically launched from points west of the White Sands Proving Ground,\r\nfloated over the range as targets, and descended in the areas northeast\r\nof White Sands Proving Ground where the “strange” materials were\r\nallegedly found.\r\n\r\nIn 1958 the first manned stratospheric balloon flights were made from\r\nHolloman AFB (see page 102). In 1960, balloon tests of components of\r\nthe first U. S. reconnaissance satellite were also flown at Holloman\r\nAFB. In the 1960’s, 70’s, and 80’s high altitude balloons were used\r\nin support of Air Force, and other U.S. Government and university\r\nsponsored research projects. Instrument testing of atmospheric entry\r\nvehicles for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\r\nspace probes is one prominent example.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 49. Holloman Balloon Branch personnel prepare a\r\n  polyethylene balloon laminated with aluminum to serve as a target\r\n  for radar guided missiles over White Sands Proving Ground, N.M.\r\n  (_U.S. Air Force photo_)]\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh Altitude Balloons and America’s First Satellite\r\n\r\n  An illustration of the important contributions of the Holloman AFB\r\n  Balloon Branch, and the necessity for a rapid recovery of a high\r\n  altitude balloon payload, were evaluations of components of the\r\n  first U.S. satellite-based reconnaissance system, code named CORONA.\r\n\r\n  The Soviet Union had already beaten the U.S. into space with\r\n  the launch and orbit of SPUTNIK I on October 4, 1957. The next\r\n  achievement in the quest for space superiority were the physical\r\n  recovery of a payload that had been in orbit.[85] The DISCOVERER\r\n  satellite, the sensor used in the CORONA program, was to be\r\n  propelled into orbit and then eject a capsule containing an\r\n  American flag to enable the U.S. to claim this honor.[86]\r\n\r\n  The DISCOVERER program had been plagued by failure with 10\r\n  unsuccessful missions in 1959 and 1960. With the eyes of the nation\r\n  watching, and the Soviets testing a similar system, more failures\r\n  could not be tolerated. To test the faulty components of the\r\n  DISCOVERER, U.S. Air Force high altitude balloons at Holloman AFB\r\n  were determined to be the most expedient method of conducting the\r\n  evaluations.\r\n\r\n  In April 1960, DISCOVERER XI, on the launch pad at Vandenberg\r\n  AFB, Calif., was put into a hold pending results of the balloon\r\n  tests.[87] The first test at Holloman AFB on April 5th was\r\n  unsatisfactory due to a parachute failure.[88] On April 8th, with\r\n  pressure mounting, the Balloon Branch launched another balloon\r\n  with the DISCOVERER capsule. This test, in which the capsule was\r\n  dropped over White Sands Missile Range and recovered immediately,\r\n  was a total success.[89] The results were relayed by telephone\r\n  from the Balloon Control Center at Holloman AFB to the launch pad\r\n  at Vandenberg AFB where the countdown resumed.[90] Despite the\r\n  successful balloon drop, DISCOVERER XI and DISCOVERER XII were\r\n  failures.[91] Therefore, balloon testing continued throughout the\r\n  summer of 1960.\r\n\r\n  Finally, on August 11, 1960, DISCOVERER XIII successfully ejected\r\n  a capsule and, amid much fanfare, the first recovery of a manmade\r\n  object that had orbited the earth was accomplished.[92] This first\r\n  successful mission of an American satellite, made possible in part\r\n  by Holloman AFB high altitude balloons, enabled the U.S. to beat\r\n  the Soviets and claim the honor of the first space recovery by only\r\n  nine days.[93]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 50.

Both of these spacecraft\r\nlooked remarkably similar to the classic dome-shaped “flying saucer.”\r\n\r\nIn 1966–67 and 1972, eight of the UFO lookalikes were launched by the\r\nBalloon Branch from the former Roswell Army Air Field (now Roswell\r\nIndustrial Air Center), N.M.[94] The spacecraft were transported by\r\nAir Force balloons to altitudes above 100,000 feet and released for a\r\nperiod of self-propelled, supersonic, free-flight prior to landing on\r\nthe White Sands Missile Range.[95] While the origins of the “Roswell”\r\nscenarios cannot be specifically traced to these vehicles, their\r\nflying saucer-like appearance, and the fact that they were launched\r\nexclusively from the original “Roswell Incident” location, leaves an\r\nimpression that perhaps these odd balloon payloads may have played\r\nsome role in the unclear and distorted stories of at least some of the\r\n“Roswell” witnesses.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 52.

(_NASA_)]\r\n\r\n=Tethered Balloons.= The Holloman Balloon Branch, in addition to high\r\naltitude research activities, also conducted low altitude tethered\r\nballoon flights. It appears that descriptions of these balloons may\r\nhave become part of the “Roswell Incident.”\r\n\r\nMost standard shaped tethered balloons are readily identified when near\r\nthe ground or when the tether is visible. Other experimental tethered\r\nballoons are not so easily identified. During the 1960s, Balloon Branch\r\npersonnel flew experimentally shaped tethered balloons from deep\r\ncanyons of central New Mexico. To a distant observer, from a vantage\r\npoint above the canyon rim, where the tether and ground anchors are\r\nnot visible, an experimental tethered balloon might lead some persons\r\nto speculate as to the oddly shaped balloon’s origin and purpose. One\r\ndesign of a low altitude tethered balloon may have inspired at least\r\none account of an “alien” craft. In _The Truth About the UFO Crash at\r\nRoswell_, the authors published a drawing of a crashed alien spaceship\r\nallegedly based on a drawing given to them by an anonymous witness.[96]\r\nWhen this drawing is compared to a photograph of an experimental\r\ntethered balloon flown at Holloman AFB in March 1965, the similarities\r\nare undeniable.[97] The tethered balloon and the NASA space probes are\r\njust two examples of the uncommon technologies that were flown in New\r\nMexico by the Holloman Balloon Branch.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 56.

(_U.S. Air\r\n  Force photo_)]\r\n\r\nToday, the Air Force maintains a reduced but still highly capable\r\nhigh altitude balloon program at Holloman AFB. The Space and Missile\r\nCommand, Test and Evaluation Unit (SMC/TE, OL-AC) represents the sole\r\nDepartment of Defense high altitude research balloon capability. The\r\nability of a U.S. Air Force high altitude balloon to lift a scientific\r\npayload to more than 100,000 feet, above 99 per cent of the earth’s\r\natmosphere, for days at a time, presents a profoundly useful scientific\r\ntool at a fraction of the cost of a space research platform. Recent\r\ntests that utilized Holloman balloons included atmospheric sampling\r\nand gravity measurement experiments, high altitude astronomic studies,\r\nweapons systems evaluations, and gamma ray detection experiments. While\r\nmost tests continue to be launched from the permanent balloon launch\r\nfacility at Holloman AFB, U.S. Air Force balloon crews have recently\r\nlaunched balloons from numerous field locations in the U.S. (including\r\ntwo sites in Roswell), as well as Alaska, Panama, and Antarctica.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 58.

(_U.S. Air\r\n  Force photo_)]\r\n\r\n\r\nBalloon and Payload Recoveries\r\n\r\nUFO theorists support their claims of an extraordinary occurrence in\r\nthe New Mexico desert by describing mysterious U.S. military personnel,\r\noperating a variety of vehicles and aircraft that always seem to\r\narrive shortly after the crash of a “flying saucer.” When carefully\r\nscrutinized, the descriptions of the mystery crews, their equipment,\r\nmethods, and the areas where the recoveries allegedly occurred—in\r\ntargeted high altitude balloon recovery areas—indicates that Holloman\r\nBalloon Branch activities were most likely responsible for the claims.\r\n\r\nTo successfully recover high altitude balloons, balloon recovery\r\ntechnicians regularly ventured far from Holloman AFB. In most instances\r\nthe balloons and their scientific payloads were recovered from\r\npredetermined recovery areas. These regularly targeted areas, located\r\nin Arizona, West Texas, and New Mexico, included the area surrounding\r\nRoswell.[98] From 1947 to the present, the Roswell area has been the\r\nsite of hundreds of balloon and payload recoveries (including those\r\nthat carried anthropomorphic dummies).[99]\r\n\r\nThe regularly targeted areas were the result of the evolution of high\r\naltitude balloon control techniques developed at Holloman AFB. These\r\ntechniques were based on meteorological, geographical, and operational\r\nconditions that exist in New Mexico. These factors, combined with ample\r\namounts of skill and experience of balloon controllers at Holloman AFB,\r\ndetermined the impact points of Holloman high altitude balloons.\r\n\r\nMany of the procedures used to position Air Force balloons are\r\ndescribed in _General Philosophy and Techniques of Balloon Control_,\r\nand _Meteorological Aspects of Constant-Level Balloon Operations in\r\nthe Southwestern United States_, both by Bernard D. Gildenberg (see\r\nstatement in Appendix B).[100] Gildenberg served as the Holloman\r\nBalloon Branch Meteorologist, Engineer, and Physical Science\r\nAdministrator from 1951 until 1981. During this period, Gildenberg, a\r\nrecognized world expert in upper atmospheric wind patterns, pioneered\r\nmethods to launch, control, track, and recover high altitude balloons.\r\nMany of these methods are still used today by the U.S. Air Force and by\r\nresearch organizations throughout the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nInteraction with Civilians\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 59. Bernard D. “Duke” Gildenberg (_center_)\r\n  Balloon Branch Meteorologist, is shown here in May 1957 in front\r\n  of the MAN HIGH I gondola. With Gildenberg are MAN HIGH I pilot\r\n  Capt. Joseph W. Kittinger, Jr. (_left_), and MAN HIGH project\r\n  scientist/pilot, Lt. Col. David G. Simons (MC). When Gildenberg\r\n  attempted to inform UFO theorists that high altitude balloon\r\n  projects were likely responsible for some of the UFO claims, his\r\n  explanations were rejected, _see also_ pages 8 & 9. (_U.S. Air\r\n  Force photo_)]\r\n\r\nIn several accounts, unsubstantiated allegations have been made\r\nthat military personnel who retrieved equipment from rural areas of\r\nNew Mexico intimidated and threatened civilians. Contrary to these\r\ncharges, Balloon Branch personnel enjoyed good relations with the\r\nlocal community and often solicited their assistance in the area of a\r\nballoon or payload landing. In the flat, featureless desert areas of\r\nsoutheastern New Mexico near Roswell, the parachutes, payloads, the\r\nballoons themselves, and circling chase aircraft often drew crowds of\r\ncurious onlookers from the local community. In fact, so many civilians\r\nwere often present at balloon or payload landing sites, the scene was\r\ndescribed by longtime civilian Balloon Branch recovery supervisor,\r\nRobert Blankenship, as being like the “circus coming to town.”[101]\r\n\r\nAllegations that civilians were threatened or told to “forget what they\r\nsaw” are profoundly inaccurate. Threats, intimidation, or other types\r\nof misconduct by Balloon Branch personnel would have served no purpose\r\nsince without the cooperation of local persons, many recoveries would\r\nnot have been possible.[102]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 60. (_Right_) This ranch family assisted in the\r\n  recovery of a Project STARGAZER high altitude balloon payload and\r\n  is shown here with a panel from the unmanned gondola. (_U.S. Air\r\n  Force photo_)]\r\n\r\nMost balloon recoveries were coordinated in advance with local\r\nlaw enforcement agencies.[103] If a balloon or payload landed on\r\nprivate property and the owner could not be located, Balloon Branch\r\noperating instructions dictated that the local sheriff or police\r\nmust be contacted.[104] In situations where local persons arrived at\r\nballoon landing sites before the recovery crews, they were simply\r\nasked to “step back” to allow recovery personnel to secure the\r\nballoon equipment.[105] If these persons inquired as to the purpose\r\nof a balloon flight, they were informed by technicians that it was a\r\nU.S. Air Force scientific study and were given a telephone number at\r\nHolloman AFB if they required additional information. At Holloman AFB,\r\nindividuals qualified to answer detailed questions responded to these\r\ninquiries. There was never a reason to mislead or threaten individuals\r\nwho observed balloon operations. Relations with local citizens were\r\ngood, and Balloon Branch personnel and equipment were a common sight to\r\nresidents in areas with high incidences of balloon operations.\r\n\r\nIn a few instances, situations arose when persons not familiar with the\r\nprocedures and equipment used by the Balloon Branch misunderstood their\r\nactivities. Such misunderstandings occurred several times during the\r\n1970s and 1980s when recovery crews not only attracted the attention of\r\nlocal citizens while coordinating balloon recoveries, but also drew the\r\nattention of federal law enforcement agencies.[106]\r\n\r\nChecks with the local sheriff revealed that the trucks and circling\r\naircraft in the desert near Roswell were part of a balloon recovery\r\nmission, and not a drug smuggling operation. Apparently, balloon\r\nrecoveries appeared to be something suspicious even to federal agents.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 61.

This question can be answered by comparing\r\nwitness testimony and the Air Force projects of the 1950s, HIGH\r\nDIVE and EXCELSIOR. Both of these projects employed anthropomorphic\r\ndummies flown by high altitude balloons and appeared to satisfy the\r\nrequirements of the previously established research profile:\r\n\r\n  _a._ An activity that if viewed from a distance would appear\r\n  unusual.\r\n\r\n  _b._ An activity for which the exact date was not likely to have\r\n  been known because many dummies were dropped over a six-year period\r\n  (1953–1959).\r\n\r\n  _c._ An activity that took place in many areas of rural New Mexico.\r\n\r\n  _d._ An activity that involved a type of aerial vehicle with\r\n  dummies that had four fingers, were bald and wore one-piece gray\r\n  suits.\r\n\r\n  _e._ An activity that required recovery by numerous military\r\n  personnel and an assortment of vehicles that included a wrecker, a\r\n  six-by-six, and a weapons carrier.\r\n\r\nThe testimony used in the following comparison, an undocumented mixture\r\nof firsthand and secondhand re-countings, are the actual statements,\r\nnot the interpretations of UFO proponents, that are presented to\r\n“prove” the Earth was visited by extraterrestrial beings and the U.S.\r\nAir Force has covered up this fact since 1947. This comparison is\r\naugmented by references to photographs whenever possible to illustrate\r\nthe undeniable similarities between the descriptions provided by the\r\nwitnesses and the equipment and methods employed by the Air Force\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 70. Project HIGH DIVE anthropomorphic dummy\r\n  launch. (_U.S. Air Force photo_)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            “Crash” Site 1\r\n                     (Allegedly North of Roswell)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis summarized account is the basis for the alleged “flying saucer”\r\ncrash site north of Roswell.[*] The exact location is not known since\r\nthe witness, Mr. James Ragsdale, in two separate sworn statements, has\r\ndescribed two different sites, many miles apart.[107] This account was\r\nexcerpted from an interview with Mr. Ragsdale by author Donald Schmitt.\r\nA transcript of the complete interview is included in Appendix C.\r\n\r\n[*] In _The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell_ (Avon Books, 1994, p.\r\n131), the authors provided a corroborating account for this testimony\r\nfrom a 96-year-old man who was in ill health, whose interview was not\r\ntape recorded, and has since died. According to the book, the man’s\r\n“wife and daughter said that he was easily confused” and “memories of\r\nhis life were jumbled and reordered.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Account\r\nJames Ragsdale\r\n\r\n“_They was using dummies in those damned things_”[108]\r\n\r\nTestimony attributed to Ragsdale, who is deceased, states that he and\r\na friend were camping one evening and saw something fall from the sky.\r\nThe next morning, when they went to investigate, they saw a crash site:\r\n\r\n“One part [of the craft] was kind of buried in the ground and one part\r\nof it was sticking our [out] of the ground.” “I’m sure that [there] was\r\nbodies ... either bodies or dummies.” “The federal government could\r\nhave been doing something they didn’t want anyone to know what this\r\nwas. They was using dummies in those damned things ... they could use\r\nremote control ... but it was either dummies or bodies or something\r\nlaying there. They looked like bodies. They were not very long ...\r\n[not] over four or five foot long at the most.” “We didn’t see their\r\nfaces or nothing like that ... we had just gotten to the site and the\r\nArmy ... and all [was] coming and we got into a damned jeep and took\r\noff.”\r\n\r\nThis testimony then describes an assortment of military vehicles used\r\nto recover the “bodies”: “It was two or three six-by-six Army trucks a\r\nwrecker and everything. Leading the pack was a '47 Ford car with guys\r\nin it.... It was six or eight big trucks besides the pickup, weapons\r\ncarriers and stuff like that.” Ragsdale also said that before he left\r\nthe area he observed the military personnel “gathering stuff up” and\r\n“they cleaned everything all up.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAssessment\r\n\r\nIn his testimony, Ragsdale made numerous references to equipment,\r\nvehicles, and procedures consistent with documented anthropomorphic\r\ndummy recoveries for projects HIGH DIVE and EXCELSIOR. The repeated\r\nuse of the term “dummy” and the witness’ own admission that “they was\r\nusing dummies in those damned things” and “I’m sure that was bodies ...\r\neither bodies or dummies” leaves little doubt that what he described\r\nwas an anthropomorphic dummy recovery.\r\n\r\nBased on testimony attributed to this witness, the confusion could\r\nhave resulted from the fact that he observed these activities from a\r\ndistance. If the witness was even a short distance from the odd looking\r\nanthropomorphic dummies, it would be logical for him to believe, when\r\ninterviewed 35 to 40 years after the event, that he “thought they were\r\ndummies or bodies or something.” Also, for some of the high altitude\r\ndrops, the dummies did not separate from the suspension rack and\r\n“rode the rack” to the ground without deployment of a parachute.[109]\r\nIf the parachutes of the dummies or parachutes of the rack assembly\r\ndid not deploy (a common occurrence during the early dummy drops),\r\nthen they free-fell from up to 98,000 feet.[110] As a result of these\r\nmalfunctions, the arms and legs of the dummies were often separated\r\nfrom the body on impact.[111] This may account for the witness’\r\ndescription of bodies [not] “over four or five foot” tall.\r\n\r\nAnother portion of his testimony suggesting that the witness observed\r\nan Air Force high altitude balloon and dummy recovery was the\r\nstatement: “The federal government could have been doing something\r\nbecause they didn’t want anyone to know what this was ... they was\r\nusing dummies in those damned things ... they could use remote\r\ncontrol.” Balloon controllers used remote control to relay commands to\r\nthe balloon control package to valve gas and drop ballast.[112] The\r\ndummies themselves were also dropped from the suspension rack by remote\r\ncontrol.[113]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71. Numerous vehicles and various types\r\nof equipment, were often present at high altitude balloon and\r\nanthropomorphic dummy launch and recovery locations. (photo collection\r\nof Ole Jorgeson) ]\r\n\r\nThe witness also described a Balloon Branch procedure that required the\r\narea of a balloon or payload landing to be restored to its original\r\ncondition. It was evident in the statements “They cleaned everything\r\nall up” and “They began gathering the stuff up.” Thoroughly cleaning\r\na balloon or dummy landing site and removing any debris deposited\r\nthere was a standard procedure to maintain good community relations and\r\navoid legal claims that could arise over property damages or livestock\r\nlosses.[114] Cattle were known to ingest scraps of polyethylene balloon\r\nmaterial that sometimes littered entire fields following a balloon\r\nfailure or flight termination.[115]\r\n\r\nThe military vehicles described were also consistent with recovery\r\nand communications vehicles used during the 1950s to retrieve\r\nanthropomorphic dummies and suspension racks.[116] The witness stated\r\nhe saw a “wrecker,” a “six-by-six,” a “weapons carrier,” a “'47 Ford\r\ncar,” and a “pickup.” The “wrecker” was most likely a M-342 5-ton\r\nwrecker that was assigned to the Balloon Branch for launch and recovery\r\noperations.[117] Other vehicles described were also the type used to\r\nlaunch and recover anthropomorphic dummies. The “six-by-six” is a\r\nlikely reference to a M-35 2½-ton cargo truck; “weapons carriers” were\r\nthe common name of a Dodge M-37 ¾-ton utility truck. References to\r\n“the pickup” and a “'47 Ford car,” were likely descriptions of other\r\ncivilian and military vehicles often present at high altitude balloon\r\nlaunch and recovery locations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            “Crash” Site 2\r\n              (Allegedly 175 miles Northwest of Roswell)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis purported flying saucer “crash” site is allegedly 175 miles\r\nnorthwest of Roswell in an area of New Mexico known as the San Agustin\r\nPlains.[118] The contention that a flying saucer crashed at this\r\nlocation and was recovered by the U.S. military is supported by three\r\nprincipal testimonies, two secondhand and one firsthand.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Secondhand Accounts\r\n\r\nThese accounts were related by Mr. Vern Maltais and Ms. Alice Knight,\r\nwho were acquainted with the alleged original eyewitness, Mr. Grady\r\nL. Barnett, who is deceased. Unless otherwise noted, the following\r\nstatements appeared on footage used to prepare a video, _Recollections\r\nof Roswell Part II_, by The Fund for UFO Research (see Appendix C).\r\n\r\n\r\nAlice Knight\r\n\r\n“_I don’t recall the date_”[119]\r\n\r\n“I don’t remember whether it was before my husband and I were married\r\nor after, I don’t recall the date. But he [the eyewitness] saw a UFO\r\nfall ... and he got nearly to the site ... but they got nearly up to\r\nthe UFO but it was close enough that you could see some creatures.\r\nHe said they didn’t look like human beings out there. And along came\r\ngovernment cars and trucks. I guess it was government. You know it was\r\na long time ago ... and they told him to go on back and forget that\r\nthey ever saw anything, and that’s all I recall.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAssessment\r\n\r\nThis brief testimony suggests that the witness did not know the date\r\nof this event. It also appears that the “creatures” were seen from a\r\ndistance, as evidenced by the statement, “They got nearly up to the\r\nUFO but it was close enough that you could see some creatures.” The\r\ntestimony also seems consistent with a description of anthropomorphic\r\ndummies as the witness stated they “didn’t look like human beings.”\r\n\r\n\r\nVern Maltais\r\n\r\n“_Their heads were hairless ... no eyebrows, no eyelashes, no\r\nhair_”[120]\r\n\r\nThis secondhand witness alleged that the eyewitness told him he\r\nobserved “beings” from a “flying saucer that had burst open” that were\r\n“about three and a half to four feet tall, very slim ... their heads\r\nwere hairless, with no eyebrows, no eyelashes, no hair” with “sort of\r\na pear-shaped head.” He also related that “the beings were ... not\r\nexactly like human beings ... similar but not exactly.” He described\r\nthat the hands of the beings “were not covered” ... and [they] only had\r\n“four fingers.” He also related that the clothing of the beings was\r\n“one-piece and gray in color”.[121] The witness concluded that “As they\r\n[the witnesses] were just starting to look things over really closely,\r\nthe military moved in and gave them a briefing to not say anything\r\nabout it.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 72. “Their heads were hairless ... no\r\n  eyebrows, no eyelashes, no hair,” a likely description of Alderson\r\n  Laboratories type anthropomorphic dummy. These Alderson dummies, of\r\n  the same type used for Projects HIGH DIVE/EXCELSIOR, were used to\r\n  test NASA’s APOLLO spacecraft three-man couch at Holloman AFB, N.M.\r\n  in 1965. (_U.S. Air Force photo_)]\r\n\r\n\r\nAssessment\r\n\r\nThis description of events also indicates that the eyewitness\r\napparently did not closely examine the scene and was “just starting\r\nto look things over” when the military arrived. As with the previous\r\ntestimony, from a distance the dummies were likely to look, as\r\ndescribed by the witness, “not exactly like humans ... similar but not\r\nexactly.” The description of the flying saucer that had “burst open”\r\nis a likely description of the dummy suspension rack that was open on\r\nthe sides (see figures 74, 75, 76). The detailed descriptions of the\r\n“beings” as “about three and a half to four feet tall, very slim in\r\nstature ... their heads were hairless, with no eyebrows, no eyelashes,\r\nno hair,” with “hands that were not covered” and “had only four\r\nfingers,” is a likely description of an Alderson Research Laboratories\r\nmodel anthropomorphic dummy. The head of the Alderson dummy was “bald”\r\nand the area of the eyebrows protruded but had no “hair” (see figure\r\n72). Also, a distinguishing feature of the Alderson dummy, unlike the\r\nSierra dummy, was that it had individual fingers not covered by gloves\r\nthat were often damaged during the tests resulting in the loss of\r\nfingers (see figures 35, 73, 75).\r\n\r\nDue to the secondhand nature of these accounts, even UFO theorists were\r\nnot convinced that this “incident” actually occurred. Corroborating\r\ntestimony of a firsthand witness was necessary to verify these claims.\r\nThe firsthand testimony is examined next.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Firsthand Account\r\n\r\nThis testimony became part of the Roswell Incident in 1990 following an\r\nepisode of the television program _Unsolved Mysteries_.[122] Following\r\na dramatized re-creation on the program, persons with information\r\nconcerning this event were encouraged to call a special toll free\r\ntelephone number.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset, some UFO theorists were skeptical of this testimony\r\ndue to the amount of detail provided from the witness who was only five\r\nyears old in 1947. In fact, UFO organizations sponsored a conference\r\nin February 1992 to evaluate the testimony for authenticity.[123]\r\nThe witness was asked to take a polygraph examination, which he\r\npassed.[124] Many UFO enthusiasts remained skeptical of the claims and\r\ndenounced this testimony as “no more than a fabrication.”[125]\r\n\r\nUnless otherwise noted, two sources of testimony attributed to the\r\nwitness have been used in this examination; interviews used to prepare\r\nthe video _Recollections of Roswell Part II_ by the Fund for UFO\r\nResearch (see Appendix C) and _Crash at Corona_ by Don Berliner and\r\nStanton Friedman (passages from this book were used only when exact\r\nquotations of the witness were indicated).\r\n\r\n\r\nGerald Anderson\r\n\r\n“_I thought they were plastic dolls ... I didn’t think they were\r\nreal_”[126]\r\n\r\nAnderson related that as a five-year-old boy on an outing with his\r\nfamily in west central New Mexico, they stumbled upon the crash of\r\nsome type of aerial vehicle.[127] When he first saw the craft he\r\nthought it was a “blimp.”[128] According to Anderson he “didn’t really\r\nget very close,”[129] but thought he saw four bandaged crewmembers\r\nand at first he “thought they were plastic dolls.”[130] He also\r\ndescribed attempts by persons in his party to communicate with one\r\nof the “crewmembers.”[131] Soon after, other civilians arrived (some\r\nwearing pith helmets) followed by military personnel in an assortment\r\nof vehicles and aircraft commanded by a “redheaded captain.”[132] The\r\nmilitary personnel, after “screaming and hollering” at the civilians\r\n“this is a military secret,” started a recovery operation of the alien\r\ncraft and crew.[133] Anderson also recalled that the military personnel\r\nthreatened some of the civilians with imprisonment or death before\r\nescorting them out of the area.[134]\r\n\r\n\r\nAssessment\r\n\r\nAnderson’s choice of the terms “blimp” to describe the crashed vehicle,\r\nand “dolls” to describe the “crew,” strongly suggests that a balloon\r\nwith an anthropomorphic dummy payload was the foundation for this\r\ntestimony. He also provided an abundance of supporting details that\r\naccurately described vehicles, aircraft, equipment, and procedures\r\nused by the Holloman AFB Balloon Branch to launch and recover\r\nanthropomorphic dummies.\r\n\r\nAn aspect of this testimony that is not accurate is the alleged threats\r\nand intimidation of civilians by military personnel. The use of such\r\nheavy-handedness was not a tactic used by the Air Force. A careful\r\nreview of official records and interviews with numerous persons\r\nwho actively participated in and were responsible for the conduct\r\nof Air Force members on high altitude balloon recovery operations\r\nrevealed that these allegations are untrue.[135] Additionally, the\r\nwitness alleges that the military personnel were “screaming and\r\nhollering” “this is a military secret.”[136] This statement might lead\r\nuninitiated persons to believe that the witness observed something\r\nhighly classified and that by telling everyone present that it was a\r\n“military secret” would somehow help it to remain so. However, logic\r\ndictates that if something was classified “screaming and hollering”\r\nit was “secret,” would compromise it and not serve to protect its\r\nclassification. This application of logic, combined with the fact that\r\nthe launch and recovery of anthropomorphic dummies was unclassified,\r\nwidely publicized, and often observed by local civilians, indicates\r\nthat the witness’ recollections are in error. There was never a reason\r\nto disrespect, “scream,” “holler,” or forbid any person from talking\r\nabout the launch or recovery of anthropomorphic dummies.\r\n\r\n=The “Crewmembers.”= The statement “I thought they were plastic\r\ndolls” seems an odd choice of words to describe an extraterrestrial\r\nbeing and is a likely reference to an anthropomorphic dummy whose\r\nskin was made of plastic.[137] This description is similar to that\r\nof the sole witness of the other crash site, north of Roswell, who\r\ndescribed the “aliens” as “dummies.”[138] Other references provided\r\nby this witness further indicate that anthropomorphic dummies were\r\nthe basis for these descriptions. The heads of the “crewmembers” were\r\ndescribed as “completely bald” with “no visible ears ... just a rise\r\n... and then a hole.”[139] This is an accurate description of Alderson\r\nResearch Laboratories model dummies that did not have “hair” and had\r\neither plastic “ears” molded to the head or a circular opening where\r\na “demountable ear” or additional instrumentation was attached (see\r\nfigure 22).[140] The statement “they didn’t have a little finger,”[141]\r\na detail very similar to one provided by another witness, also appears\r\nto be a description of dummies manufactured by Alderson Laboratories\r\nthat were often damaged during the balloon tests resulting in the loss\r\nof fingers.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 73. “Some kind of container, a metal box,” was\r\n  described as laying on the ground near the alleged aliens. This\r\n  appears to be a reference to boxes containing electrical components\r\n  of the remote controlled systems positioned on the top of the dummy\r\n  suspension rack. (_U.S. Air Force photo_)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 74. “They looked like they had some sort of\r\n  bandages on ’em ... over his ... arm ... around his midsection and\r\n  partially over his shoulder”—witness description of tape and nylon\r\n  webbing used to prevent arms and legs from flailing, and parachute\r\n  harness that had chest and shoulder straps. Tape was also used to\r\n  secure the removable back plate of the head (_also see figs. 29,\r\n  30, 73, 75_). (_U.S. Air Force photo_)]\r\n\r\nThe assertion that “they were all wearing one-piece suits ... a shiny\r\nsilverish-gray color,” “trimmed in ... maroon-like cording”[142] is\r\na likely reference to a standard issue, gray, Air Force flightsuit\r\nused to outfit the dummies and red duct-type tape used in the tests\r\nthat prevented air from filling the flightsuit (see fig. 30).[143] The\r\nrecollection that “crewmembers” had “bandages”[144] on their bodies\r\nwere likely references to tape and nylon webbing used to prevent\r\nflailing of a dummy’s arms and legs during tests.[145] A reference to\r\na bandage “around his [the crewmember’s] midsection and partially over\r\nhis shoulder”[146] is a likely reference to the standard B-4 or B-5\r\nparachute with chest and shoulder straps worn by the dummies.[147]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 75. “Its uniform was torn in a couple spots ...\r\n  their uniforms were in pretty sad shape”—witnesses description of\r\n  secondhand flightsuits that were used repeatedly on tests; tears\r\n  and other damage were common. In this photo, 1st Lt. Raymond A.\r\n  Madson “rigs” a dummy to its suspension rack for project HIGH DIVE\r\n  at Holloman AFB, N.M. (_U.S. Air Force photo_)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 76. A witness described at least one person\r\n  at a “crash” site wearing a pith helmet. In the 1950s, the pith\r\n  helmet was part of the Air Force uniform and was often worn on\r\n  balloon launches and recoveries. In this publicity photo from _On\r\n  the Threshold of Space_, Air Force members at Holloman AFB who were\r\n  extras in the film can be seen wearing pith helmets. (_also see\r\n  figure 49_)]\r\n\r\n=The “Craft.”= In what appears to be a clear reference to a balloon,\r\nwas that when he saw the crashed vehicle he “thought it was a\r\nblimp.”[148] Additional descriptions of cables that “went from one\r\nkind of a package of components to another kind of package” and a\r\n“metal box” were likely references to the balloon control package that\r\nwas positioned on top of the dummy suspension rack.[149] A further\r\nreference to a balloon payload is the statement that on a hot New\r\nMexico day the crashed vehicle was “ice cold, it felt like it just\r\ncame out of the freezer.”[150] This accurately describes a physical\r\ncondition known as “cold soaking” common to high altitude payloads\r\nthat had recently been exposed to sub-zero temperatures of the upper\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 77. “An observation aircraft ... a high-winged\r\n  aircraft”—a witness’s probable reference to a U.S. Air Force L-20\r\n  aircraft used extensively by Holloman AFB crews to track and\r\n  recover anthropomorphic dummies. (_U.S. Air Force photo_)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 78. Described as present at a flying saucer\r\n  “crash” site was a C-47 aircraft. This is a probable reference to\r\n  a U.S. Air Force C-47 transport aircraft used to move equipment to\r\n  launch sites distant from Holloman AFB. These aircraft were also\r\n  used for aerial tracking of high altitude balloon flights including\r\n  those that flew anthropomorphic dummies. (_U.S. Air Force photo_)]\r\n\r\n=Military Aircraft.= The witness also described two aircraft of the\r\nsame type used for anthropomorphic dummy recoveries as having been\r\ninvolved in the activity he witnessed. One aircraft was described as\r\na “C-47” and another as an “observation aircraft ... a high-winged\r\naircraft.”[151] These were a C-47 and a L-20 aircraft used extensively\r\nby the Balloon Branch during the mid 1950s for tracking and recovering\r\nanthropomorphic dummy balloon flights.[152] This testimony also\r\ndescribed aircraft that were typically overhead during a recovery and\r\nan established procedure of landing on a rural road or in a field to\r\nreach isolated balloon launch or recovery locations.[153]\r\n\r\n=Military Vehicles.= Numerous military vehicles, several of which\r\nwere described by other witnesses as having been at the other crash\r\nsite north of Roswell, were also described. Witnesses at the two\r\ndifferent sites described a “wrecker” and a “six-by-six,” both of the\r\ntype used for anthropomorphic dummy recoveries.[154] The account also\r\ndescribed two vehicles unique to the Balloon Branch that were used for\r\nthe majority of high altitude balloon recoveries during the mid- to\r\nlate-1950s.\r\n\r\nThe witness described a “jeep-like truck that had a bunch of radios\r\nin it”.... There was a guy sittin’ in there wearin’ earphones and he\r\nwas talking on the radio.“[155] This is a likely description of a\r\nDodge M-37 ¾-ton utility truck, known as a weapons carrier, that had\r\nbeen specially modified to carry radio equipment for balloon recovery\r\noperations. The Holloman AFB Balloon Branch modified these vehicles\r\nin 1953, ruling out the possibility that the witness observed them in\r\n1947, when such vehicles were not available to organizations performing\r\nballoon operations.[156] The other vehicle described and used by the\r\nBalloon Branch were “military ambulances.”[157] During the mid-1950s,\r\nthe Balloon Branch modified three M-43 ¾-ton ambulances for use as\r\nballoon recovery and communications vehicles.[158] These vehicles were\r\nused for anthropomorphic dummy launch and recovery missions to relay\r\nmessages to circling recovery aircraft and the balloon operations\r\ncenter at Holloman AFB.[159] The witness also described “a trailer with\r\na motor on it, like a generator.”[160] This@ is a likely description\r\nof a 1½-ton cargo trailer with an MB-19 15 Kilowatt diesel generator.\r\nThese generators were used primarily on balloon launch sites during the\r\n1950s and 1960s (see fig. 71).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 79. “Stretching stuff out on the ground,\r\n  dragging stuff out of trucks”—a likely witness reference to high\r\n  altitude balloon inflation procedure that required the balloon to\r\n  be stretched out on a protective ground cloth prior to inflation.\r\n  (_U.S. Air Force photo_)]\r\n\r\n=Balloon Branch Procedures.= Descriptions of military personnel\r\n“stretching stuff out on the ground, dragging stuff out of trucks”[161]\r\nis a likely description of a balloon launch procedure that required\r\nthe fragile polyethylene balloon and its protective ground cloth to\r\nbe removed from a launch vehicle and laid out on the ground prior to\r\ninflation. Another procedure described by the witness was an apparent\r\nreference to a balloon recovery practice of recording the names of\r\ncivilians who observed high altitude balloon recoveries.[162] The\r\nwitness stated that military personnel “took everybody’s name and\r\neverything,”[163] which was a procedure to ensure payment of a $25\r\ndollar reward to persons who assisted in the recovery. This procedure\r\nwas also necessary to settle future claims of property damage caused by\r\nthe balloon, payload, or recovery vehicles.[164]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 80. Witnesses described a “tanker,” “military\r\n  ambulances,” a “6 × 6,” and a “wrecker”—probable references to\r\n  (_from left_) a helium tank trailer, a M-43 ambulance (converted to\r\n  a communications vehicle), a M-35 cargo truck (partially obscured),\r\n  and a M-342 wrecker. These vehicles were used for off-range launch\r\n  and recovery operations of anthropomorphic dummies for Project HIGH\r\n  DIVE/EXCELSIOR. Shown here is a May 29, 1957 dummy launch near\r\n  Hatch, N.M. (_also see figs. 23, 28, 64, 71, 81_). (_U.S. Air Force\r\n  photo_)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 81. Scene typical of a mid- to late 1950s\r\n  off-range high altitude balloon launch. (_U.S. Air Force photo_)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Summary\r\n\r\nWhen the claims offered by UFO theorists to prove that an\r\nextraterrestrial spaceship and crew crashed and were recovered by the\r\nU.S. Air Force are compared to documented Air Force activities, it is\r\nreasonable to conclude, with a high degree of certainty, that the two\r\n“crashes” were actually descriptions of a launch or recovery of a high\r\naltitude balloon and anthropomorphic dummies. This conclusion was based\r\non the remarkable similarities and independent corroboration between\r\nthe witnesses who described _both_ of the “crash sites.” Statements\r\nsuch as “they was using dummies in those damned things” and a\r\ncharacterization of the crashed vehicle as, “I thought it was a blimp”\r\nare two of the many similarities. The extensive detailed descriptions\r\nprovided by the witnesses, too numerous to be coincidental, were of\r\nthe equipment, vehicles, procedures, and personnel of the Air Force\r\nresearch organizations who conducted the scientific experiments HIGH\r\nDIVE and EXCELSIOR.\r\n\r\nThough it is clear anthropomorphic dummies were responsible for these\r\naccounts, the specific locations of the events described was difficult,\r\nif not impossible, to determine since the witnesses were not specific.\r\nA witness to the “crash site” north of Roswell, Mr. James Ragsdale,\r\nwas not certain of the actual location as evidenced by a change in\r\nhis sworn testimony that moved the site many miles from its original\r\nlocation.[165]\r\n\r\nHowever, since Ragsdale reportedly lived or worked in the Roswell,\r\nArtesia, and Carlsbad, N.M. areas during the period when the dummies\r\nwere used, it is likely he described one or more of the nine documented\r\ndummy recoveries in areas near there.\r\n\r\nReports of the other crash site, allegedly 175 miles northwest of\r\nRoswell on the San Agustin Plains, is likely based on descriptions of\r\nmore than one launch and recovery of anthropomorphic dummies. Since\r\none witness, Gerald Anderson, described procedures consistent with the\r\nlaunch _and_ recovery of high altitude balloons, it is likely that he\r\nwitnessed both of these activities, with at least one that included an\r\nanthropomorphic dummy payload.\r\n\r\nThe two secondhand witnesses to this “crash,” Vern Maltais and Alice\r\nKnight, could have related descriptions from any of the dummy launch\r\nor landing sites. However, Maltais and Knight repeatedly described the\r\nimpact location of the flying saucer as on the San Agustin Plains.\r\nOne possible explanation is that the witnesses, in the 30 or more\r\nyears since they were told the story by the original eyewitness, Mr.\r\nBarney Barnett, a soil conservation engineer who reportedly traveled\r\nextensively throughout New Mexico, may have confused San Agustin\r\nPlains with San Agustin Pass or San Agustin Peak, an area in the San\r\nAgustin Mountains of New Mexico. These areas are just outside the\r\nboundary of the White Sands Missile Range and the adjacent Jornada\r\nTest Range. Numerous anthropomorphic dummy balloon flights terminated\r\nand were recovered in this area. Furthermore, if the civilians\r\nwitnessed dummy landings on either the White Sands Missile Range or the\r\nJornada Test Range, both test areas and restricted U.S. Government\r\nreservations, then this explains why they may have been told to leave\r\nthe landing site. In the popular Roswell scenarios, witnesses were\r\nallegedly instructed by military personnel to leave the area because\r\nthey witnessed something of a highly classified nature. This would\r\nbe unlikely since the witnesses described projects that utilized\r\nanthropomorphic dummies which were unclassified. It is likely, however,\r\nthat if the witnesses ventured onto one of these ranges they were\r\ninstructed to leave, not because of classified activities, but for\r\ntheir own safety.\r\n\r\nThese conclusions are supported by official files, technical reports,\r\nextensive photographic documentation, and the recollections of numerous\r\nformer and retired Air Force members and civilian employees who\r\nconducted Projects HIGH DIVE and EXCELSIOR. The descriptions examined\r\nhere, provided by UFO theorists themselves, were so remarkably—and\r\nredundantly—similar to these Air Force projects that the only\r\nreasonable conclusion can be that the witnesses described these\r\nactivities. These many similarities are summarized in Table 1.1.\r\n\r\nThe next section will examine the accounts of “aliens” at the hospital\r\nat Roswell Army Air Field. As previously stated, due to the lack of\r\ngeneral or detailed similarities with testimony of the two rural “crash\r\nsites,” the hospital account was determined not to be associated with\r\nthese reports.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Table 1.1\r\n\r\n Comparison of Testimony to Actual Air Force Equipment, Vehicles, and\r\n     Procedures Used to Launch and Recover Anthropomorphic Dummies\r\n\r\n  Notes:\r\n\r\n  “Crash Site” 1—Site North of Roswell\r\n\r\n  “Crash Site” 2—Site 175 miles Northwest of Roswell\r\n\r\n  Shaded areas indicates corroboration between witnesses.\r\n\r\n  Boxed shaded areas indicates corroboration between witnesses at\r\n  different “crash” sites.\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                                     Air Force\r\n     Witness Description        Equipment/Procedure         “Crash Site”\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  =The “Aliens”=\r\n                                 +--------------------------+\r\n  1. “They was using dummies in  |Reference to              |   Site 1\r\n  those damned things.”[166]     |anthropomorphic dummies   |\r\n                      _Ragsdale_ |(figs. 11, 14, 21–22, 29, |\r\n                                 |30–33, 35, 40, 72–75, 45).|\r\n                                 +--------------------------+\r\n\r\n                                 +--------------------------+\r\n  2. “I thought they were        |Reference to              |   Site 2\r\n  plastic dolls”[167]            |anthropomorphic dummies   |\r\n                      _Anderson_ |that had plastic skin.    |\r\n                                 +--------------------------+\r\n\r\n                                 +--------------------------+\r\n  3. “an experimental plane with |Reference to              |   Site 1\r\n  dummies in it”[168]            |anthropomorphic dummies.  |\r\n                       _Kaufman_ +--------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 +--------------------------+\r\n  4. “I’m sure that was bodies   |Reference to              |   Site 1\r\n  ... either bodies or           |anthropomorphic dummies.  |\r\n  dummies.”[169]                 +--------------------------+\r\n                      _Ragsdale_\r\n\r\n                                 +--------------------------+\r\n  5. “it was either dummies or   |Reference to              |   Site 1\r\n  bodies or something laying     |anthropomorphic dummies.  |\r\n  there.”[170]                   +--------------------------+\r\n                      _Ragsdale_\r\n\r\n                                 +--------------------------+\r\n  6. “his eyes was open, staring |Reference to              |   Site 2\r\n  blankly”[171]                  |anthropomorphic dummy.    |\r\n                      _Anderson_ +--------------------------+\r\n\r\n                                 +--------------------------+\r\n  7. “not exactly like human     |Reference to              |   Site 2\r\n  beings ... similar, but not    |anthropomorphic dummies.  |\r\n  exactly.”[172]                 +--------------------------+\r\n                       _Maltais_\r\n\r\n                                 +--------------------------+\r\n  8. “didn’t look like human     |Reference to              |   Site 2\r\n  beings”[173]                   |anthropomorphic dummies.  |\r\n                       _Knight_  +--------------------------+\r\n\r\n  9. “they didn’t have a little   Reference to Alderson         Site 2\r\n  finger”[174]                    Laboratories dummy that\r\n                      _Anderson_  were reused many times and\r\n                                  were often damaged but\r\n                                  remained in service.\r\n                                  (figs. 35, 73, 75).\r\n\r\n  10. “they had four              Corroboration of              Site 2\r\n  fingers”[175]                   description #9.

The International UFO Museum and Research\r\n  Center in Roswell, N.M. ]\r\n\r\nThe mystery witnesses were allegedly an Army Air Forces nurse and a\r\npediatrician both assigned to the Roswell AAF hospital in 1947.[2] To\r\ncasual observers, this account, which contains references to actual\r\nU.S. Army Air Forces and U.S. Air Force personnel and activities,\r\nappears to have a ring of authenticity. However, when examined closely\r\nby Air Force researchers, the dates of events, the events themselves,\r\nand the people described as having participated in them, were found to\r\nbe grossly inaccurate and totally unrelated to activities of July 1947.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Account\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of information provided by W. Glenn Dennis,\r\nwho claimed he was a 22-year-old mortician at the Ballard Funeral Home\r\nin Roswell in July 1947, when he alleged these events occurred.[*]\r\n\r\n  [*] Excerpts of interviews contained in this summary were taken\r\n  from audio or video recordings made by persons referenced in the\r\n  appropriate endnote. The sole exception is the interview conducted\r\n  by Stanton T. Friedman on August 5, 1989. Quotations from this\r\n  interview were taken from a transcript which is reportedly an\r\n  accurate representation of the interview. Friedman has not honored\r\n  repeated requests for an audio recording.\r\n\r\nOn July 7, 1947, Dennis alleged he received a series of phone calls at\r\nthe Ballard Funeral Home, where he worked, from the Mortuary Affairs\r\nofficer at Roswell Army Air Field. He recalled that the mortuary\r\nofficer inquired as to the availability of child sized caskets and\r\nprocedures for preserving bodies that had been “laying out in the\r\nelements.”[3] Later that day he received an emergency ambulance call\r\n(the civilian mortuary for which he worked also provided an ambulance\r\nservice) to respond to the site of a minor traffic accident in\r\nRoswell.[4] The accident victim was an “airman” stationed at Roswell\r\nAAF, and Dennis transported the airman to the hospital at the base.[5]\r\n\r\nAs Dennis walked into the hospital he noticed three military box-type\r\nambulances, one or more of which contained what appeared to be\r\n“wreckage.”[6] He described the wreckage as being inscribed with odd\r\nmarkings or symbols and bluish-purplish in color.[7] He recalled that\r\nsome of this wreckage was resting against the inside wall of the rear\r\ncompartment of the ambulance and two pieces of it “looked kind of like\r\nthe bottom of a canoe.”[8] He described other wreckage on the floor of\r\nthe ambulance as being “all sharp” and as best he could tell “was like\r\nbroken glass.”[9] He also recalled observing Military Policemen (MPs)\r\nstanding at the back of two of these ambulances.[10]\r\n\r\nWhen he went inside the hospital, he encountered a military nurse who\r\nwas assigned there and with whom he was previously acquainted.[11] The\r\nnurse, who looked upset, was covering her mouth with a cloth and told\r\nhim that “you’re going to get in a lot of trouble” and that he should\r\n“just get out of here.”[12] Dennis also stated that he encountered\r\na military doctor who was assigned to the hospital, a pediatrician,\r\nwith whom he was “pretty good friends” but did not speak with at that\r\ntime.[13]\r\n\r\nHaving seen the wreckage in the rear of the ambulance and believing\r\nthere had been an accident, he asked another officer in the hospital if\r\nthere had been a plane crash. The officer, whom Dennis had never seen\r\nbefore, asked him: “Who in the hell are you?” When he responded he was\r\n“from the funeral home,” the officer summoned two MPs to escort him\r\nfrom the hospital.[14]\r\n\r\nHowever, before Dennis and the two MPs had left the hospital, he\r\nheard someone say, “We’re not through with that SOB, bring him back\r\nhere.”[15] When Dennis turned around, he observed a redheaded captain\r\n(in one version of these events Dennis is quoted as describing this\r\nperson as a “big redheaded colonel”[16]) who said, “You did not see\r\nanything. There was no crash here. You don’t go into town making any\r\nrumors that you saw anything or that there was any crash ... you could\r\nget in a lot of trouble.”[17]\r\n\r\nAngry about being called an SOB, Dennis informed the redheaded officer\r\nthat he was a civilian, not under his authority, and that he, the\r\nredheaded officer, “can’t do a damn thing to me.”[18] The redheaded\r\nofficer was alleged to have threatened Dennis by responding “Oh yes we\r\ncan”.... “Somebody will be picking your bones out of the sand”.... “We\r\ncan do anything to you ... that we want to.”[19] A black sergeant, whom\r\nDennis recalled had accompanied the redheaded officer, allegedly stated\r\nhe would “make real good dog food.”[20] Following this exchange, Dennis\r\nclaimed he was “picked up ... arm and arm” and escorted back to his\r\nplace of business by two MPs.[21]\r\n\r\nThe following day, July 8, 1947, Dennis attempted to telephone the\r\nnurse he had seen in the hall at the hospital to find out “what was\r\ngoing on.”[22] He stated that he was unable to reach the nurse but did\r\nreach another nurse, a “Captain Wilson,” who explained to him that the\r\nnurse he was trying to contact was not on duty, but “Wilson” would give\r\nher a message to call him.[23] The nurse called Dennis later that same\r\nday at the funeral home where he worked and agreed to meet with him at\r\nthe officers’ club at Roswell AAF that afternoon.[24]\r\n\r\nWhen the two met, the nurse appeared disturbed and ill.[25] Dennis\r\nasked her to explain what was going on when they met in the hospital\r\nthe day before. The nurse explained that, in the course of her normal\r\nduties, she entered an examining room to get some supplies and\r\nencountered two doctors whom she did not recognize that “supposedly\r\nwere doing a preliminary autopsy” on “three,” “very mangled,” “black,”\r\n“little bodies.”[26] The doctors requested the nurse remain in the\r\nroom because they needed her assistance.[27] She allegedly explained\r\nthat there was a terrible odor in the room that made both her and the\r\ndoctors ill.[28] Due to this terrible odor and inadequate ventilation,\r\nthe nurse allegedly told Dennis that the autopsies were moved to\r\nanother facility on the base and then “everything” was taken to “Wright\r\nField” (now Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio).[29]\r\n\r\nThe nurse described the little bodies in detail and even provided a\r\ndiagram.[30] She described “little bodies” three to four feet in length\r\nthat had large, “flexible,” heads, and concave eyes and noses.[31]\r\n\r\nAfter this meeting Dennis claimed he never saw the nurse again, and he\r\nwas told she had been shipped out the same afternoon (July 8, 1947)\r\nor the next day (July 9, 1947).[32] However, some time later Dennis\r\nreceived a letter from the nurse that indicated she was in London,\r\nEngland.[33] Dennis stated that he tried to respond to the nurse, but\r\nhis letter was returned stamped “return to sender” and “deceased.”[34]\r\nAfter receiving this letter, he inquired at the base about the nurse\r\nand was told by “Captain Wilson” that she didn’t know where the nurse\r\nwas, but there was a rumor that she and several other nurses had been\r\nkilled in a plane crash while on a training mission.[35]\r\n\r\nSome years later, Dennis stated that he visited the unidentified\r\nmilitary pediatrician he had seen at the hospital.[36] The pediatrician\r\nhad since left the military and set up practice in Farmington, N.M.[37]\r\nDennis said he and the pediatrician discussed the incident of years\r\npast but was stopped short when the pediatrician told him that he was\r\nconsulted regarding this incident, but that “it was completely out of\r\n[his] field of medicine,” then ended the discussion.[38]\r\n\r\nBased on this account, UFO theorists have presented the following\r\nassertions:\r\n\r\n  =a.= Dennis, the “missing” nurse, and the unidentified pediatrician\r\n  inadvertently stumbled onto the highly classified autopsies of\r\n  alien bodies at Roswell AAF hospital in July 1947.\r\n\r\n  =b.= The two mysterious doctors at the hospital were sent\r\n  to Roswell AAF from a higher headquarters to conduct the\r\n  autopsies after which the bodies were transported to what is now\r\n  Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.\r\n\r\n  =c.= The bluish-purplish wreckage that looked like the bottom of\r\n  a canoe in the rear of the ambulance, were “escape pods” from a\r\n  flying saucer flown by the aliens that crashed in the Roswell area.\r\n\r\n  =d.= Dennis was forcibly removed from the hospital and threatened\r\n  with death by the redheaded officer because he had witnessed some\r\n  of these activities.\r\n\r\n  =e.= The nurse was kidnapped, possibly murdered, and all records\r\n  that she ever existed were systematically destroyed by government\r\n  agents, also because she witnessed these activities.\r\n\r\nAs in other accounts examined in this report, the episodes described\r\nhere became part of the Roswell Incident only because the witness\r\nclaimed they occurred at a very specific time, July 7–9, 1947. These\r\ndates coincide with an actual event: the retrieval of experimental\r\nProject MOGUL research equipment that was erroneously reported as\r\na flying disc (see Section One).[39] If the events described here\r\noccurred at any other time—years, months, weeks, or even days before or\r\nafter July 7–9, 1947—they might be considered unusual to an uninformed\r\nperson, but certainly not part of the Roswell Incident.\r\n\r\nAir Force research revealed that the witness made serious errors\r\nin his recollections of events. When his account was compared with\r\nofficial records of the actual events he is believed to have described,\r\nextensive inaccuracies were indicated including a likely error in the\r\ndate by as much as 12 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  2.1\r\n\r\n               The “Missing” Nurse and the Pediatrician\r\n\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the errors in this account and to identify actual events,\r\nthe following section will examine the accounts of the missing nurse\r\nand the unidentified pediatrician. Both of these persons were allegedly\r\npresent at the Roswell AAF hospital when the events described by the\r\nwitness occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Missing” Nurse\r\n\r\nDennis recalled that the nurse was quickly and suspiciously shipped out\r\neither the same day or the day after he met with her in the Roswell\r\nAAF Officers’ Club. If this allegation was true, it certainly seemed\r\nunusual—and verifiable. Therefore, the morning reports, the certified\r\ndaily personnel accounting records required to be kept by all Army Air\r\nForces units at that time, were obtained and reviewed. These reports\r\ndid not indicate that a nurse or any other person was reassigned on\r\nthe days alleged, July 8 or July 9, 1947.[40] The morning reports of\r\nthe 427th Army Air Forces Base Unit (AAFBU) Squadron “M,” the unit\r\nthat all the medical personnel at Roswell AAF were assigned in July\r\n1947, did not indicate a sudden or overseas transfer of a nurse or\r\nany other person. Records indicated that one nurse was reassigned on\r\nJuly 23, 1947, over two weeks after the purported events described by\r\nDennis.[41] That nurse was transferred by normal personnel rotation\r\nprocedures to Ft. Worth AAF (now Carswell AFB), Texas, where she\r\nremained on active duty until March 1949.[42] In fact, the Squadron “M”\r\nmorning reports revealed the strength of the Army Nurse Corps (ANC) at\r\nRoswell AAF for July 1947 was only five nurses. Of these five nurses\r\nnone were transferred overseas or killed in a plane crash—the “rumored”\r\nfate of the missing nurse.[43]\r\n\r\nThis review of the hospital morning reports also indicated that the\r\nname of the missing nurse provided by the witness was inaccurate. The\r\nwitness stated in several interviews that he believed the nurse’s name\r\nwas Naomi Maria Selff.[44] A comprehensive search of morning reports\r\nand rosters from the Roswell AAF Station Hospital indicated that no\r\nperson by this name, or a similar name, had ever served there. This\r\nfinding was supported by a search of personnel records at the National\r\nPersonnel Records Center (NPRC) in St. Louis, Mo., a part of the\r\nNational Archives and Record Administration. NPRC is the depository for\r\nall U.S. military personnel records. The search at NPRC also did not\r\nfind a record that a person named Naomi Maria Selff had ever served in\r\nany branch of the U.S. Armed Forces.\r\n\r\nThese findings were consistent with previous efforts of several\r\npro-UFO researchers who have also attempted to locate this nurse or\r\nmembers of her family. They, likewise, were also unable to confirm\r\nher existence.[45] While some UFO theorists continue to allege that\r\nthis absence of records regarding a nurse by this name is part of a\r\nconspiracy to withhold information, the most likely reason for the lack\r\nof records is that this name is inaccurate.[*]\r\n\r\n  [*] Interestingly, an article published in the Fall 1995 edition\r\n  of _Omni_ magazine, a publication that in the past has published\r\n  sensational “Roswell” claims, also independently accounted for all\r\n  five of the nurses and expressed a decidedly skeptical opinion of\r\n  the account of the “missing nurse.”\r\n\r\nEven though the name of the nurse is incorrect, it appears that a nurse\r\nassigned to the Roswell AAF Station Hospital in 1947 may have been the\r\nbasis for the claims. Eileen Mae Fanton was the only nurse of the five\r\nassigned to Roswell AAF in July 1947, whose personal circumstances and\r\nphysical attributes not only resembled those of the missing nurse, but\r\nappeared to be nearly an exact match.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Missing Nurse?”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 2. Eileen M. Fanton (_U.S. Air Force photo_)]\r\n\r\n  1st Lt. Eileen M. Fanton was assigned to the Roswell Army Air\r\n  Field Station Hospital from December 26, 1946 until September 4,\r\n  1947.[46] Fanton, who is deceased, was retired from the U.S. Air\r\n  Force at the rank of Captain on April 30, 1955, for a physical\r\n  disability.[47]\r\n\r\n  In this account, the missing nurse is described as single, “real\r\n  cute, like a small Audrey Hepburn, with short black hair, dark\r\n  eyes and olive skin.”[48] Lieutenant Fanton was single in 1947,\r\n  5′1″ tall, weighed 100 pounds, had black hair, dark eyes, and was\r\n  of Italian descent.[49] Dennis also stated that the nurse was of\r\n  the Catholic faith, and had been “strictly raised” according to\r\n  Catholic beliefs.[50] Fanton’s personnel record listed her as Roman\r\n  Catholic, a graduate of St. Catherine’s Academy in Springfield,\r\n  Ky. and as having received her nursing certification from St. Mary\r\n  Elizabeth’s Hospital in Louisville, Ky.[51]\r\n\r\n  The witness also recalled that the “missing nurse” was a\r\n  lieutenant, was a general nurse at the hospital, and had sent him\r\n  correspondence at a later date which stated she was in London,\r\n  England with a New York, N.Y. APO number (military overseas mailing\r\n  address) as the return address.[52] Records revealed that Fanton\r\n  was a First Lieutenant (promoted from Second Lieutenant to First\r\n  Lieutenant in June 1947), and she was classified as a “nurse,\r\n  general duty.”[53] Records also indicated that of the five nurses\r\n  assigned to the Roswell AAF Station Hospital in July 1947, she\r\n  was the only one that later served a tour of duty in England.\r\n  Furthermore, she was assigned to the 7510th USAF Hospital, APO\r\n  240, New York, N.Y., where she served from June 1952 until April\r\n  1955.[54]  The 7510th USAF Hospital was located approximately 45\r\n  miles north of London at Wimpole Park, Cambridge, England.\r\n\r\n  An additional similarity between Fanton and the “missing nurse”\r\n  is that her personnel record indicated that she quickly departed\r\n  Roswell AAF and it is probable that the hospital staff would not\r\n  have provided information concerning her departure. Fanton’s\r\n  unannounced departure from Roswell AAF, on September 4, 1947 was\r\n  to be admitted to Brooke General Hospital, Ft. Sam Houston, Texas,\r\n  for a medical condition.[55] This condition was first diagnosed\r\n  in January 1946 and ultimately led to her medical retirement\r\n  in 1955.[56] Therefore, if someone other than a family member\r\n  contacted the Station Hospital at Roswell AAF and inquired about\r\n  Fanton, as Dennis stated he did, the staff was simply protecting\r\n  her privacy as a patient. The staff was not participating in a\r\n  sinister “cover-up” of information as alleged by UFO theorists.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pediatrician\r\n\r\nIn at least two interviews, the witness stated that a pediatrician\r\nstationed at the hospital was involved in the events he described.[57]\r\nWhen asked by an interviewer how he knew the pediatrician was\r\ninvolved, Dennis was quoted as replying, “I know he was involved\r\nbecause I saw him there.”[58] Dennis is also quoted as saying that\r\nhe and the pediatrician were “pretty good friends,” and after the\r\npediatrician left the military he [the pediatrician] set up a practice\r\nin Farmington, N.M. “I used to go fishing all the time up north and\r\nI visited him several times up there and he was involved,” Dennis\r\nsaid. “I don’t remember his name, I think he is still practicing in\r\nFarmington.”[59]\r\n\r\nA review of personnel files and interviews with former members of the\r\nRoswell AAF/Walker AFB hospital staff, revealed that only one physician\r\never relocated to Farmington, N.M. following his military service. The\r\nformer Capt. Frank B. Nordstrom served at Walker AFB from June 1951\r\nuntil June 1953.[60] Records also revealed that Nordstrom was indeed a\r\npediatrician and while at Walker AFB, served as the Chief of Pediatric\r\nServices.[61] When Nordstrom, a resident of the small town of Aztec,\r\nN.M., was interviewed for this report, he stated that he did not recall\r\never meeting Dennis and could not recall any events that supported any\r\nof his claims (see signed sworn statement in Appendix B).[62]\r\n\r\nFarmington (population 8,000 in 1954) is located in the primarily\r\nrural Four Corners region of New Mexico approximately 300 miles\r\nnorthwest of Roswell. According to Nordstrom, Farmington did not have a\r\npediatrician before his arrival in 1954. From 1954 until approximately\r\n1970, Nordstrom believes he was the only pediatrician in the area. His\r\nrecollections were confirmed by a local Farmington pharmacist, Charles\r\nE. Clouthier.[63] Clouthier also served at the Walker AFB hospital,\r\nfrom 1955 to 1957, and following his military service returned to\r\nFarmington, his hometown, where he had lived since 1934. Clouthier has\r\nbeen employed by and co-owned a business, Farmington Drug, since 1957.\r\nHe is familiar with most, if not all, of the doctors who practice\r\nin Farmington and the Four Corners region of New Mexico. Clouthier’s\r\nconfirmation that Nordstrom was the first pediatrician to practice\r\nin the Farmington area, was based on both his frequent professional\r\ncontacts with local physicians and his experiences as a longtime\r\nFarmington resident.[64]\r\n\r\nAlthough Nordstrom believed that he was the pediatrician described, he\r\nwas at a loss to explain how Dennis gained information concerning his\r\nmilitary and civilian employment history. In a signed sworn statement,\r\nNordstrom stated that he did not recall ever meeting Dennis and had\r\ncertainly never been visited by Dennis as he has claimed. One possible\r\nsource of the information is that from approximately 1958 until\r\napproximately 1961 Dennis operated a drugstore in Aztec, N.M., a small\r\ntown near Farmington where Nordstrom resides (interestingly Aztec is\r\nthe location of the original “crashed flying saucer” story, see below).\r\nHowever, Nordstrom also did not recall any contact with Dennis in his\r\ncapacity as a drugstore operator.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Behind the Roswell Incident?\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 3. Story by J.P. Cahn, that appeared in the\r\n  August 1956, _True_ magazine.]\r\n\r\n  The “Roswell Incident” story is hardly original. In 1948, a work\r\n  of fiction reportedly appeared in the _Aztec_ (N.M.) _Independent\r\n  Review_ describing the crash of a flying saucer with “little\r\n  men” near Aztec, N.M. In 1950, Frank Scully, a columnist for\r\n  the theatrical publication _Variety_, published a book, _Behind\r\n  the Flying Saucers_, which proclaimed the story to be true.[65]\r\n  Based on the Aztec story, _Behind the Flying Saucers_ bears many\r\n  similarities to the Roswell Incident, most notably, descriptions\r\n  of covert “flying saucer” and “little men” recoveries interspersed\r\n  with doses of unsubstantiated accusations directed at the U.S. Air\r\n  Force.[66]\r\n\r\n  In his book, Scully claimed he had information from two scientists,\r\n  Silas M. Newton and a mysterious “Dr. Gee,” who he claimed\r\n  investigated the crash for the government.[67] In reality,\r\n  Newton and Gee were con-men who convinced Scully of the story’s\r\n  authenticity.[68]\r\n\r\n  Intrigued by the sensational claims made in _Behind the Flying\r\n  Saucers_, a reporter for the _San Francisco Chronicle_, J. P. Cahn,\r\n  decided to look into the matter. What resulted from Cahn’s research\r\n  were articles in the September 1952 and August 1956 edition of\r\n  _True_ magazine which determined that the story was as “phony as a\r\n  headwaiters bow and smile.”[69]\r\n\r\n  Cahn, with the assistance of a magician, devised a plan to “sting”\r\n  the two con-men.[70] To execute the sting, he used sleight of\r\n  hand switching an “indestructible” metal disk, claimed to be\r\n  from a flying saucer, with a slug of his own manufacture. After\r\n  the switch, Cahn submitted the disk to a laboratory for analysis\r\n  revealing that they were of earthly origin, in particular, a grade\r\n  of aluminum used to manufacture pots and pans![71]\r\n\r\n  Even with the exposure of this obvious fraud, the Aztec story is\r\n  still revered by UFO theorists. Elements of this story occasionally\r\n  reemerge and are thought to be the catalyst for other crashed\r\n  flying saucer stories, including the Roswell Incident.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 4. September 1952 _True_ magazine story that\r\n  exposed the Aztec, N.M. hoax.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDescriptions of Other Air Force Members\r\n\r\nSince official records proved that none of the nurses at Roswell AAF\r\nin July 1947 were missing, and the nurse and pediatrician described\r\nin this account had been identified, major discrepancies between\r\nDennis’ recollections and official records were apparent. In an effort\r\nto provide for the fullest possible accounting of these claims, even\r\nthough key aspects had already been proven false, Air Force researchers\r\nsought additional information to determine if there was validity to\r\n_any_ portion of the account. Since the witness has never provided\r\ndocumentation to support his claims, the only source of additional\r\ninformation was the numerous interviews he had previously provided to\r\nprivate researchers and the media. His many statements, which have\r\nappeared in newspapers, videos, magazines, movies, books, lectures,\r\njournals and television programs, were reviewed for information that\r\nmight further explain his testimony.\r\n\r\nExamination of this large body of publicly available information\r\nimmediately provided clues that the witness may have recalled\r\nincidents from a period other than July 1947. The first clue was that\r\nhe repeatedly, in all of the interviews, referred to the injured\r\nmilitary person he allegedly transported to the Roswell AAF hospital\r\nas an airman. The rank of airman was not in existence in 1947. It\r\nwas implemented on April 1, 1952.[72] Prior to that date an airman\r\nin the Air Force was referred to by the U.S. Army equivalent, a\r\nprivate. Another possible indication that he recalled events from a\r\ndifferent time was the description of an alleged “black sergeant” that\r\naccompanied the redheaded officer at the hospital. The pairing of a\r\nwhite officer with a black NCO seemed unlikely since in 1947 the U.S.\r\nArmy Air Forces was racially segregated, as were all branches of the\r\narmed forces. The U.S. Air Force did not begin racial integration until\r\nthe May 11, 1949 issuance of Air Force Letter 35-3 that formally ended\r\nsegregation.[73] Though it was not impossible in 1947 for a black NCO\r\nto accompany and seem to be working with a white officer, it would be\r\nunlikely. These two discrepancies did not provide a firm time frame of\r\nactual events, if any occurred at all.\r\n\r\nTo approximate a time frame for actual events, the specific details\r\nof the information provided were examined. This examination was to\r\ndetermine if any military members were identified by name or by a\r\ncombination of any other distinguishing characteristics such as rank,\r\nposition, age, or physical attributes. If the testimony identified\r\na military member as having been present for an event, then their\r\npersonnel record could be used to affix an approximate date. Affixing\r\na date of an event by referencing personnel records was possible since\r\neach military member’s personnel file contains a physical description\r\nand chronological listing of duty stations, units of assignment, and\r\nwork assignments for his/her entire military career.\r\n\r\nThis detailed examination revealed several likely references to\r\nspecific individuals, which through their personnel files, were\r\ndocumented as having been assigned to the hospital at Roswell AAF or\r\nWalker AFB (Roswell AAF was renamed Walker AFB in January 1948).\r\n\r\n=The “Big Redheaded Colonel.”= An indication that Dennis might have\r\nmistaken the date of actual events was that he was quoted in at least\r\none book as having said that the officer who threatened him in the\r\nhospital was a big redheaded colonel.[74] Research revealed that only\r\none tall colonel with red hair was known to have been assigned to the\r\nWalker AFB hospital. Colonel Lee F. Ferrell was the hospital commander\r\nfrom October 1954 until June 1960.[75] Ferrell was 6′1″ tall and had\r\nred hair.[76]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 5. Col. Lee F. Ferrell (_left_), was commander\r\n  of the Walker AFB hospital from 1954–1960. In this photo Ferrell\r\n  escorts U.S. Senator Dennis Chavez (N.M.) on a tour of the new\r\n  Walker AFB hospital in June 1960, which was named in honor of the\r\n  senator. (_U.S. Air Force photo_) ]\r\n\r\n“=Captain ‘Slatts’ Wilson.=” In at least two interviews Dennis\r\nrepeatedly made reference to a nurse named “Captain Wilson.”[77] He\r\nrecalled that “Captain Wilson”, who he believed was the head nurse, was\r\nanother nurse stationed at the Roswell AAF hospital in July 1947.[78]\r\nDennis claims he spoke to “Captain Wilson” several times in reference\r\nto the alleged missing nurse.[79]\r\n\r\nHe claims that on the day after he met with the missing nurse at the\r\nRoswell AAF Officers’ Club, he attempted to contact her by telephone\r\nat the hospital but was told that she wasn’t on duty.[80] Instead, he\r\nspoke with “Captain Wilson.” “I called the station I knew she [the\r\nmissing nurse] always worked at,” Dennis said, “She was a general\r\nnurse.... I was informed that she wasn’t working that day. [Dennis\r\nthen telephoned] An old girl by the name of Wilson, Captain Wilson,\r\nand I asked her ‘what happened’? She said, ‘Glenn, I don’t know what\r\nhappened, she’s not on duty.’ She said she’d try to get word to her\r\n[the missing nurse] that you [Dennis] want to talk to her.”[81] Later\r\nin the same interview Dennis further described Wilson. “We called\r\nher ‘Slatts’ Wilson who was a big tall nurse about six foot two or\r\nthree—big tall skinny gal—and we called her ‘Slatts’—everybody called\r\nher ‘Slatts.’ She’s the one who told me she heard there was a plane\r\ncrash and the nurses went down on a training mission.”[82]\r\n\r\nThe testimony appeared to clearly identify by name, rank, position,\r\nphysical attributes and by a distinctive nickname, “Slatts,” another\r\nnurse present at the hospital in July 1947. But a review of the morning\r\nreports of the Roswell AAF hospital for July 1947 did not contain the\r\nname of a nurse, or anyone else, named Wilson.[83] The only female\r\ncaptain assigned to the Roswell AAF Hospital in July 1947 was the\r\nChief Nurse Capt. Joyce Goddard.[84] Goddard, who was 5′6″ tall, was\r\ntransferred from Roswell AAF to Korea on August 21, 1947.[85]\r\n\r\nTherefore, according to Dennis’ recollection of events, this review of\r\nthe morning reports indicated that there were two missing nurses, not\r\none—“Lieutenant Naomi Selff” and “Captain ‘Slatts’ Wilson.” Further\r\nscrutiny of personnel records of individuals assigned to the Roswell\r\nAAF/Walker AFB hospital indicated that Dennis’ recollections of events\r\nwere apparently inaccurate.\r\n\r\nExamination of the August 1947 morning reports did not list a nurse\r\nnamed Wilson, but they _did_ list a nurse named Slattery.[86] Captain\r\nLucille C. Slattery, who retired as a Lieutenant Colonel and is now\r\ndeceased, was reassigned from Ft. George Wright, Wash. to Roswell AAF\r\non August 7, 1947.[87]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 6. Lt. Col. Lucille C. Slattery, the only Air\r\n  Force nurse ever known as “Slatts,” served as a captain at the\r\n  Roswell AAF/Walker AFB hospital from August 1947 to September 1950.\r\n  Records indicate that Slattery did not arrive at Roswell AAF until\r\n  one month _after_ the “Roswell Incident,” in direct contradiction\r\n  to statements made by the sole witness to this account. (_U.S. Air\r\n  Force photo_)]\r\n\r\nSlattery replaced Goddard as the Chief Nurse and was the only female\r\ncaptain assigned to the Roswell AAF hospital. Interviews of persons\r\nwith longtime professional and personal associations with Slattery,\r\nrevealed that she was known by the unusual nickname of Slatts.[88]\r\nAdditionally, former associates of Slattery interviewed for this\r\nreport, recalled that she was the only Air Force nurse that had ever\r\nbeen known as Slatts.[89] Persons interviewed were Air Force nurses\r\nwho retired in the 1960s, each with more than 20 years of service,\r\nincluding retired Air Force Col. Ethel Kovatch-Scott, who served as\r\nChief Nurse of the Air Force from 1963 to 1965.\r\n\r\nUpon review of Slattery’s personnel file it was learned that she was\r\nonly 5′3″ tall and therefore was most likely not the 6′2″ or 6′3″ “tall\r\nskinny” nurse described.[90] This discrepancy in physical description\r\nand the fact that she did not arrive at Roswell AAF until nearly one\r\nmonth _after_ Dennis claims he spoke to her, led to the conclusion that\r\nperhaps he confused Slattery with some other tall thin nurse, possibly\r\nnamed Wilson, who was stationed at the Roswell AAF or Walker AFB\r\nhospital at some other time.\r\n\r\nConsequently, a comprehensive review of the morning reports and\r\nrosters of the Roswell AAF/Walker AFB hospital revealed that only one\r\nnurse named Wilson had ever served there and she did not arrive until\r\nFebruary 1956.[91][*] Capt. Idabelle Miller, who became Maj. Idabelle\r\nWilson in 1958 due to marriage and a promotion, was assigned to the\r\nWalker AFB hospital from February 1956 until May 1960.[92]\r\n\r\n[*] Records were also searched for names similar to Wilson. Three\r\nnurses stationed at Roswell AAF/Walker AFB were identified: Martha\r\nWasem, Carol Williams, and Chalma Walker. None of these nurses physical\r\ndescriptions or personal/professional circumstances were similar to the\r\ndescriptions of “Captain Wilson” described by the witness.\r\n\r\nUpon review of Maj. Wilson’s personnel file, it was learned that she\r\nwas 5′9″ tall and thin. Also, she served as the Head Nurse of the\r\nsurgical ward at the Walker AFB hospital.[93] Therefore, Wilson’s\r\nphysical attributes, tall and thin, and position as Head Nurse matched\r\nDennis’ recollections of “Captain Wilson.” When contacted by Air Force\r\nresearchers, Wilson stated she had no recollection of Dennis, of ever\r\nhaving conversations with him, any of the events he described, or of\r\na nurse that was missing.[94] She also made it abundantly clear that\r\nas an Air Force officer and medical professional she would not spread\r\na rumor of a plane crash, as Dennis alleged “Captain Wilson” did in\r\nconversations with him.[95]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          Results of Missing Nurse and Pediatrician Research\r\n\r\nExamination of the missing nurse and the pediatrician stories, and\r\nother facts established by research, provide a foundation for further\r\nanalysis to determine what actual event(s), if any, were responsible\r\nfor these claims. Based on information developed, it appears this\r\nwitness may be mistaken in some of his statements, especially regarding\r\nthe time frame of these events.\r\n\r\nThe following facts have been established:\r\n\r\n  =a.= The only physician who ever relocated to Farmington, N.M.,\r\n  following his military service at Roswell AAF/Walker AFB was the\r\n  former Chief of Pediatric Services at the Walker AFB hospital,\r\n  the former Capt. Frank B. Nordstrom. Further, he did not arrive\r\n  at Walker AFB until June 1951, four years _after_ the purported\r\n  Roswell Incident, has no recollection of Dennis, the statements\r\n  Dennis attributes to him, or of any actual events that explain his\r\n  account.\r\n\r\n  =b.= The only nurse ever assigned to the Roswell AAF hospital\r\n  (subsequently renamed Walker AFB) named Wilson, was Idabelle\r\n  Wilson. She served at the Walker AFB hospital from 1956 until 1960\r\n  and had no recollection of ever meeting or speaking with Dennis or\r\n  any of the activities he described.\r\n\r\n  =c.= Captain Lucille C. Slattery, the only Air Force nurse ever\r\n  known by the distinctive nickname “Slatts,” _was_ stationed at the\r\n  Roswell AAF hospital. However, she did not arrive until August 7,\r\n  1947. This was one month _after_ the Roswell Incident, making it\r\n  improbable that Dennis spoke with her in early July 1947.\r\n\r\n  =d.= There is no record that a nurse named Naomi Maria Selff, was\r\n  ever assigned to Roswell AAF, Walker AFB, or was ever a member of\r\n  the U.S. military.\r\n\r\n  =e.= All nurses assigned to the Roswell AAF hospital in July 1947,\r\n  have been accounted for, thereby eliminating any possibility that\r\n  there was ever a missing nurse.\r\n\r\nSince actual Air Force members who served at Roswell AAF/Walker AFB\r\nhospital were described in this account, the next step was to determine\r\nif actual events that occurred at the hospital were possibly the source\r\nof this story. As stated earlier in this report, a thorough examination\r\nof both classified and unclassified records from 1947 revealed no Army\r\nAir Forces or U.S. Air Force activities that explained the alleged\r\nevents. Therefore records were reviewed from other time periods, based\r\non personnel records of individuals believed to have been identified.\r\nThese persons and the periods when they were assigned to Roswell\r\nAAF/Walker AFB are listed in Table 2.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Table 2.1\r\n               Persons Described and Periods of Service\r\n                       at Roswell AAF/Walker AFB\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n        Witness            Actual Individual       Period of Service at\r\n      Description             Described           Roswell AAF/Walker AFB\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n  the “missing” nurse     1st Lt.

A further review of Air Force activities\r\nwas then made to determine if any were significantly similar to the\r\ninformation provided. Based on the time period established by personnel\r\nrecords and statements contained in the witness’ own account, the\r\nfollowing profile of possible events was established:\r\n\r\nAn event involving the Walker AFB hospital that took place between 1947\r\nand 1960;\r\n\r\n  =a.= that may have resulted in “very mangled,” “black,” “little\r\n  bodies,” that had a strong “odor” being placed in “body bags”;\r\n\r\n  =b.= that may have resulted in two persons not normally assigned to\r\n  the hospital, believed to be doctors, that were “supposedly doing\r\n  preliminary autopsies” on the “little bodies”;\r\n\r\n  =c.= that may have involved a body with a head that was much larger\r\n  than normal which was transported to Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio;\r\n\r\n  =d.= that may have involved a redheaded captain or a big redheaded\r\n  colonel;\r\n\r\n  =e.= that may have resulted in an ambulance parked in the rear\r\n  of the hospital containing wreckage with inscriptions, that were\r\n  bluish-purplish which looked kind of like the bottom of a canoe;\r\n  and,\r\n\r\n  =f.= that may have required a heightened state of security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  2.2\r\n\r\n                          Aircraft Accidents\r\n\r\n\r\nThe examination of events that involved the Walker AFB hospital that\r\nmay explain reports of bodies was begun by reviewing the most prominent\r\npossible source, which were aircraft accident(s).[*] A review of\r\naircraft accidents from 1947 to 1960 revealed eight fatal accidents\r\nthat involved Walker AFB.\r\n\r\n  [*] Other possible explanations such as automobile accidents,\r\n  house fires, etc., were also examined.

A KC-97 similar to this of the 509th Aerial\r\n  Refueling Squadron crashed 8.8 miles south of Walker AFB on June\r\n  26, 1956 with the loss of 11 lives. Descriptions of the aftermath\r\n  of this tragedy are believed to be the basis for some of the\r\n  reports of “bodies” at the Walker AFB hospital. (_U.S. Air Force\r\n  photo_)]\r\n\r\nThe accident occurred on June 26, 1956, 8.8 statute miles south of\r\nWalker AFB.[121] A KC-97G aircraft with 11 crewmen on board, while on\r\na refueling training mission, experienced a propeller failure four\r\nand one half minutes after takeoff.[122] As a result of the propeller\r\nfailure, a propeller blade was believed to have punctured the deck fuel\r\ntank of the fully loaded tanker causing an intense cabin fire.[123] The\r\naircraft was quickly engulfed in flames, spun out of control, and was\r\ncompletely destroyed. All 11 Air Force members were killed instantly by\r\nthe fire and impact explosion.[124] Due to the isolated rural impact\r\nlocation on property owned by the state of New Mexico, there was\r\nminimal collateral damage and no fatalities or injuries to persons on\r\nthe ground.[125]\r\n\r\nThe remains of the crewmen were recovered from the crash site and\r\ntransported by members of the 4036th USAF Hospital (numerical\r\ndesignation of the hospital at Walker AFB) to the hospital facility at\r\nWalker AFB for identification.[126]\r\n\r\nOn the day following the crash, an identification specialist from\r\nWright-Patterson AFB, Ohio arrived at the hospital to assist in\r\nidentifying the remains.[127] Part way through the identification\r\nprocess, conducted by both the identification specialist and Air\r\nForce members assigned to the Walker AFB hospital, the identification\r\nactivities were moved to a refrigerated compartment at the Walker AFB\r\ncommissary.[128] This was due to an overpowering odor emitted by the\r\nburned and fuel-soaked bodies and the lack of proper storage facilities\r\nat the small base hospital.[129] Also on the day following the crash,\r\nJune 27, 1956, autopsies of three of the victims were accomplished by\r\na local Roswell pathologist.[130] These examinations were performed\r\nat a local funeral home.[131] Upon completion of the identification\r\nprocedures and the postmortem examinations, the remains were shipped to\r\nthe next of kin for burial.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 8. Main entrance of the 4036th USAF hospital\r\n  at Walker AFB, 1956. Initial identification procedures of the\r\n  11 aircrewmen killed in the June 26, 1956 KC-97 accident were\r\n  conducted here before being transferred to another facility on the\r\n  base with refrigeration capability. (_U.S. Air Force photo_)]\r\n\r\n\r\nComparison of the Account to the KC-97 Mishap\r\n\r\nThis series of actual events contains extensive similarities to the\r\naccount provided by Dennis. The numerous and extensive similarities\r\nindicate that some elements of this actual event were most probably\r\nincluded in Dennis’ account. This aircraft accident provides an\r\nexplanation for the following elements of the research profile—the very\r\nmangled, black, little bodies in body bags, the odor, the two strange\r\ndoctors, and the report of a redheaded colonel.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Aircraft Crashes and UFOs\r\n\r\n  Since the first flying saucer story in June 1947, persons have\r\n  attempted to exploit actual military aircraft accidents to support\r\n  UFO theories and propagate the flying saucer phenomenon.\r\n\r\n  One of the first exploitation attempts involved a fatal August 1,\r\n  1947 Army Air Forces B-25 accident near Kelso, Wash. Descriptions\r\n  of this accident, which UFO theorists contend was caused because\r\n  the aircraft carried parts of a flying saucer, were included in\r\n  a poorly executed hoax. Nonetheless, it received a considerable\r\n  amount of attention.\r\n\r\n  Another incidence was photographs of an “alien,” supposedly from\r\n  a 1948 crash of a flying saucer in Mexico. However, when the\r\n  photographs were examined by Air Force officials, they noticed\r\n  a pair of government issue, aviator style, sunglasses lying\r\n  underneath the “alien” body.\r\n\r\n  Perhaps the most famous attempt to exploit an actual aircraft\r\n  accident involved the fatal January 1948 crash of a Kentucky Air\r\n  National Guard F-51 fighter near Franklin, Ky. Theorists contend\r\n  the fighter was shot down by a UFO. However, it was determined\r\n  that this aircraft most probably crashed while observing a newly\r\n  invented high altitude research balloon thought to be a UFO. The\r\n  large balloon, which matched eyewitnesses’ descriptions at the\r\n  time, was released the previous day, and its ground track placed\r\n  it precisely in the area where the unidentified object was sighted\r\n  the next day. Regardless, shameless attempts to exploit this\r\n  event continued as recently as 1995, when the tabloid TV program,\r\n  _Sightings_, aired and published (_Sightings_, Simon & Schuster,\r\n  1996, 170–176) a distorted interpretation of this tragedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The “Black” “Little Bodies.”= Review of the autopsy protocols of\r\nthe victims of this accident revealed extensive similarities to the\r\ndescriptions of the bodies allegedly described by the missing nurse.\r\nDennis related in various interviews that the missing nurse described,\r\n“... three; very mangled; black; little bodies in body bags.”[132]\r\nRecords of this mishap confirmed that the victims suffered “injuries,\r\nextreme, multiple.”[133] According to persons who assisted in the\r\nidentification of the remains from this crash, and in compliance with\r\nAir Force directives in effect at that time, human remains pouches,\r\ncommonly called body bags, were used to recover and transport victims’\r\nbodies.[134]\r\n\r\nStatements made by Dennis described bodies that were “three-and-a-half\r\nto four feet tall,” and “black” in color.[135] The autopsy protocols\r\nof two victims described extensive third degree burns and loss of the\r\nlower extremities.[136] Dennis also described a head of one of the\r\nbodies that was not rigid but “flexible” and tissues of a body in\r\n“strings” that looked as if they were “pulled” by predatory animals\r\nafter the crash.[137] An autopsy protocol of a victim described\r\n“multiple fractures of all bones of the skull” and “partially cooked\r\nstrands of bowel ... over the abdomen and in the chest.”[138]\r\nAdditional similarities between the autopsy protocols and Dennis’\r\nstatements were a detached hand and descriptions of the fingers and\r\narms of the crash victims.[139]\r\n\r\nThe autopsy protocol of one victim also described remains with a “face\r\ncompletely missing.”[140] This description corresponds with Dennis’\r\nrecollections of a body with eyes and nose that were concave. Also,\r\nthe drawing of the head of one of the “little bodies” Dennis claims\r\nis representative of a drawing given to him by the missing nurse is\r\na reasonably accurate representation of a human body with its face\r\ncompletely missing.[141]\r\n\r\nAnother similarity to Dennis’ account is that of the 11 victims of this\r\naccident, only three were autopsied—the same number of bodies that\r\nwere allegedly autopsied in the missing nurse’s account.[142] Finally,\r\nrecords revealed that due to limited facilities at the Walker AFB\r\nhospital, the autopsies were performed at the Ballard Funeral Home in\r\nRoswell.[143] This is the same funeral home where Dennis claimed to be\r\nemployed in 1947 until 1962.[144][*]\r\n\r\n  [*] It is unclear when Dennis worked at this funeral home since\r\n  city and phone directories listed him as co-owning a different\r\n  funeral home in Roswell, as vice-president of another funeral home\r\n  in Roswell, and as having been employed as a drug store supervisor\r\n  and oil field worker during the periods when he claims he worked at\r\n  the Ballard Funeral Home.\r\n\r\n=The Odor.= Transportation of remains to a small base hospital was\r\nunusual since the hospital did not have the necessary facilities—a\r\npreparation room, refrigeration equipment or a morgue, to accommodate\r\nmultiple deceased persons. Records of other crashes involving Walker\r\nAFB showed that the remains of crash victims were transported either to\r\nanother facility on Walker AFB or directly to a local funeral home.[145]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 9. Three of the 11 Air Force members killed\r\n  in the June 26, 1956 KC-97 accident were autopsied at the Ballard\r\n  Funeral Home in Roswell. The actual descriptions of the remains\r\n  (only three were autopsied), closely corresponds with Dennis’\r\n  descriptions regarding the “little bodies.” Additionally, this is\r\n  the same funeral home where Dennis claimed to be employed from 1947\r\n  until 1962.]\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Air Force manual that prescribed the policies, standards\r\nand procedures relating to the care and disposition of deceased Air\r\nForce personnel in effect in 1956, Air Force Manual 143-1, _Mortuary\r\nAffairs_, did not direct that remains be brought to a hospital. It\r\nencouraged the local commander to “improvise facilities” and make\r\nuse of “garages, warehouses, large tents, or other facilities for\r\nprocessing groups of remains.”[146] Nonetheless, records of the June\r\n1956 crash and interviews with the persons who processed the remains\r\nindicated that the victims were brought from the crash site to the\r\nWalker AFB hospital.[147] During the identification procedures, the\r\nodor became too strong and the bodies and the identification activities\r\nwere moved to a refrigerated compartment at the base commissary.[148]\r\n\r\nInterviewed for this report were the registrar of the hospital, 1st\r\nLt. Jack Whenry (now a retired Major) and a medical administration\r\nspecialist assigned to the registrar, SSgt. John Walter (now a\r\nretired Master Sergeant), both of whom assisted in the processing and\r\nidentification of the deceased aircrewmen. Whenry and Walter both\r\nrecalled the strong odor, that some persons became ill during the\r\nprocedures (as did the alleged missing nurse), and the unusual transfer\r\nof the remains to the Walker AFB commissary (the nurse also allegedly\r\ndescribed the transfer of remains to another building on the base).\r\nHowever, neither recalled that a nurse was missing or any of the other\r\nactivities as described by Dennis.[149]\r\n\r\n=The “Big Redheaded Colonel.”= The big redheaded colonel is a likely\r\nreference to the hospital commander, Col. Lee F. Ferrell, who was\r\n6′1″ tall and had red hair. Ferrell served at the Walker AFB hospital\r\nfrom 1954 until 1960.[150] It would not be unusual for the hospital\r\ncommander to be present at the hospital following a major aircraft\r\naccident.\r\n\r\n=The Two Mysterious “Doctors.”= The two doctors not assigned to the\r\nWalker AFB hospital who were allegedly observed at the hospital\r\nperforming preliminary autopsies have been identified as an Air Force\r\ncivilian identification specialist and a local Roswell pathologist.\r\n\r\n=_Identification Specialist._= In an aircraft mishap involving multiple\r\nfatalities, identification of victims can go beyond the capabilities\r\nof a small Air Force hospital such as the one at Walker AFB. Beginning\r\nin July 1951, the Air Force Memorial Affairs Branch, now called Air\r\nForce Mortuary Services, employed full-time civilian morticians and\r\nfuneral directors, known as identification specialists, to assist Air\r\nForce installations in the identification of deceased persons.[151]\r\nWhen requested by the local commander, the identification specialists,\r\non a 24-hour standby basis, responded from Wright-Patterson AFB to the\r\nlocation of an incident.[152] Records confirm that Walker AFB only\r\nrequested an identification specialist on two occasions, in October\r\n1955 and to identity the victims of the June 1956 crash.[153] For this\r\naccident the identification specialist arrived at Walker AFB on June\r\n27, 1956 and made positive identifications of the 11 crewmen on June\r\n28, 1956.[154]\r\n\r\nWhen contacted for this report, the retired identification specialist\r\nwho responded to this accident, Mr. George Schwaderer, did not have\r\nany recollections of Dennis, the nurse, the pediatrician, or any of\r\nthe other unusual activities as alleged.[155] Schwaderer did recall\r\nthat on identifications of group remains such as this, it was typical\r\nto wear standard hospital surgical gowns and masks and that he was\r\noften mistaken for a pathologist.[156]\r\n\r\nDue to restrictions on the release of information concerning the\r\nidentification process, uninformed individuals who may, by chance, have\r\nwitnessed some portions of the identification, were often the source\r\nof a considerable amount of speculation. The identification procedures\r\nemployed by the identification specialists were not classified, but\r\nAFM-143-1, _Mortuary Affairs_, directed that “no information will be\r\ndivulged concerning identification or shipment of any remains until a\r\nfinal determination of identity has been resolved for all remains.”[157]\r\n\r\nFor this accident, identification took approximately two days and any\r\nreleases of information were restricted to individuals with an official\r\nrequirement. These restrictions extended, not only to the general\r\npublic, but also to Air Force members.\r\n\r\nA possible reference to the identification specialist is found in one\r\nof Dennis’ recitations of the account. Dennis, a mortician who might\r\npossess limited knowledge of Air Force mortuary procedures, stated that\r\nhe was told the “doctors” might be pathologists from “Walter Reed Army\r\nHospital.”[158] Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington D.C. is\r\na likely location that an unknown pathologist performing an autopsy on\r\nmilitary personnel might have been based. Co-located at Walter Reed is\r\nthe Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) and beginning in 1955,\r\nAFIP sent pathologists into the field to examine aircraft accidents. A\r\nreview of records at AFIP and interviews with persons involved with the\r\nidentification procedures at Walker AFB do not indicate AFIP sent any\r\npersonnel to assist in this accident.[159]\r\n\r\n=_Pathology Consultant._= In June 1956, the Walker AFB hospital did\r\nnot have a pathologist on staff.[160] All autopsies and examinations\r\nof pathological specimens were conducted by a civilian consultant from\r\nRoswell.[161] The autopsy protocols of the deceased crewmen from the\r\nJune 1956 crash indicated that Dr. Alfred S. Blauw of Roswell performed\r\nthe three autopsies.[162] Obviously, neither the pathologist nor the\r\nidentification specialist were normally assigned to the Walker AFB\r\nhospital and would not be expected to be present at the hospital,\r\nespecially to an observer with limited knowledge of these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Continuing Research\r\n\r\nThe focus of research was now shifted to other activities that might\r\nexplain the remaining portions of the profile. The unexplained portions\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n  =a.= the presence of a redheaded captain;\r\n\r\n  =b.= the wreckage in the rear of the ambulance outside the Walker\r\n  AFB hospital;\r\n\r\n  =c.= the heightened state of security at the Walker AFB hospital;\r\n  and,\r\n\r\n  =d.= the shipment of a body with a large head to Wright-Patterson\r\n  AFB.\r\n\r\nBased on previous research, this effort began by examining records of\r\nthe other Air Force aerial vehicle known to have operated extensively\r\nin the Roswell area since the late 1940s—high altitude research\r\nballoons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  2.3\r\n\r\n                    High Altitude Research Projects\r\n\r\n\r\nBy 1960, hundreds of high altitude research balloons, some that\r\ncarried anthropomorphic dummies, descended and were recovered in areas\r\nsurrounding Walker AFB and Roswell. But based on the descriptions of\r\nthe bodies and the involvement of a hospital and medical personnel,\r\nit did not seem likely that high altitude research balloons with\r\nscientific instruments or anthropomorphic dummies could possibly\r\naccount for this testimony. Therefore, the focal point of the research\r\nshifted to manned high altitude balloon flights conducted by the Air\r\nForce during the mid to late 1950s and early 1960s.\r\n\r\n\r\nManned Balloon Flights\r\n\r\nTwo manned balloon projects, MAN HIGH and EXCELSIOR, were conducted\r\nwithin the time period targeted for research: MAN HIGH from 1957 to\r\n1958[163] and the manned portion of EXCELSIOR in 1959 and 1960. The\r\nonly other manned high altitude balloon project in Air Force history,\r\nSTARGAZER, did not fly until 1962.\r\n\r\nIt was discovered that only six manned flights were made for MAN\r\nHIGH and EXCELSIOR. These flights were determined unlikely as the\r\nsource of the testimony since there were no injuries or deaths, all\r\nsix flights had been the subject of intense media coverage, and none\r\nwere flown in the vicinity of Roswell. Despite the apparent dead end\r\nthese flights presented to explain this account, records were obtained\r\nand persons involved in MAN HIGH and EXCELSIOR were contacted and\r\ninterviewed. These records and interviews confirmed that there were,\r\nin fact, only six USAF manned high altitude balloon flights, none\r\nwith characteristics similar to the testimony. However, detailed\r\nexaminations of the records revealed that, in addition to the six\r\nhigh altitude balloon flights, there were also numerous low altitude\r\nballoon flights made to train and qualify the high altitude balloon\r\npilots.[164] Records of the training flights indicated that some\r\nof these were conducted at Holloman AFB, N.M., and several mishaps\r\noccurred resulting in injuries to the pilots.[165]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 10. Maj. David G. Simons (MC) (_left_), balloon\r\n  designer Otto C. Winzen (_center_) and Capt. Joseph W. Kittinger,\r\n  Jr., examine a scale model of a low altitude balloon gondola used\r\n  to train pilots for high altitude missions. (_photo courtesy of\r\n  Mike Smith, Raven Industries_)]\r\n\r\nFurther research revealed that one accident had taken place just\r\nnorthwest of Roswell.[166] The accident occurred on May 21, 1959, 10\r\nmiles northwest of Walker AFB, on a pilot training mission for the\r\nupcoming Project EXCELSIOR and STARGAZER flights scheduled to begin\r\nthat fall. Analysis of the accident revealed actual events that closely\r\nresembled the remaining portions of the established profile.\r\n\r\n\r\n         U.S. Air Force Manned High Altitude Balloon Projects\r\n\r\n  In addition to unmanned high altitude balloon research flights,\r\n  from 1957 to 1962 the U.S. Air Force conducted a series of seven\r\n  manned high altitude flights. These forward-looking projects\r\n  investigated the upper reaches of the earth’s atmosphere and\r\n  laid the foundation for manned spaceflight. Most flights were\r\n  conducted before rocket booster technology was available to propel\r\n  a spacecraft into earth’s orbit. In this interim period, to “bridge\r\n  the gap” while awaiting developments in rocket technology, high\r\n  altitude balloons were the only vehicles capable of reaching the\r\n  altitudes required. All three of the USAF manned high altitude\r\n  balloon projects, MAN HIGH, EXCELSIOR, and STARGAZER utilized\r\n  Holloman AFB balloons to transport men to the very edge of space,\r\n  above approximately 99 per cent of the earth’s atmosphere, a region\r\n  known as “near space.”\r\n\r\n  =Project MAN HIGH.= In 1955, a combined effort by the U.S. Air\r\n  Force Aeromedical Field Laboratory, Winzen Research International,\r\n  and the Holloman Balloon Branch resulted in the first Air Force\r\n  manned balloon program. Project MAN HIGH, officially known as the\r\n  Biodynamics of Space Flight, directed by Lt. Col. David Simons\r\n  (MC), was the first of the three widely publicized manned high\r\n  altitude balloon programs. The objective of Project MAN HIGH was\r\n  to measure the physiological and psychological capabilities of a\r\n  human in a space equivalent environment. Many developments of this\r\n  successful project were later incorporated into the first phase\r\n  of the U.S. Air Force Man in Space Program nicknamed MAN IN SPACE\r\n  SOONEST (MISS). Technology developed for MISS was transferred to\r\n  NASA in 1959 and became part of Project MERCURY, the initial series\r\n  of U.S. space missions.[167]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 11.

EXCELSIOR was the dramatic climax of the high\r\n  altitude free-fall studies that began as Project HIGH DIVE in 1953\r\n  using anthropomorphic dummies. As the test director for Project\r\n  Excelsior, Capt. Joseph W. Kittinger, Jr. made three parachute\r\n  jumps from balloons, EXCELSIOR I, II, and III, from 76,000,\r\n  75,000, and a still standing record altitude of 102,800 feet.\r\n  EXCELSIOR’S scientific objective was to develop a parachute system\r\n  and techniques required to return a pilot or astronaut to earth\r\n  following an emergency high altitude escape.\r\n\r\n  =Project STARGAZER.= Project STARGAZER was the third Air Force\r\n  manned high altitude balloon program. Capt. Joseph W. Kittinger.\r\n  Jr., the veteran high altitude balloon pilot of MAN HIGH and\r\n  EXCELSIOR, was both the pilot and project engineer. On December\r\n  13, 1962, Kittinger and U.S. Navy civilian astronomer William C.\r\n  White rose to 86,000 feet to make astronomical observations with\r\n  a gyro-stabilized telescope. A joint U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy,\r\n  Smithsonian Institution, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology\r\n  program, STARGAZER made only one of a scheduled four flights due to\r\n  budget shortfalls and equipment difficulties.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 15.

This signaled the end of an era of manned high\r\naltitude balloon flight; however, these projects had indeed “bridged\r\nthe gap,” and manned space flight was now safely possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nLow Altitude Balloon Training Missions\r\n\r\n=Background.= In April 1958, Col. John P. Stapp, commander of the U.S.\r\nAir Force Aero Medical Laboratory at Wright-Patterson AFB, appointed a\r\nnew project officer for Project EXCELSIOR, Capt. Joseph W. Kittinger,\r\nJr. EXCELSIOR was part of an ongoing program to examine high altitude\r\naircraft escape procedures and equipment.[168] Kittinger was an\r\nexperienced fighter test pilot who was the pilot of the first Air Force\r\nmanned high altitude balloon project, MAN HIGH I, in June 1957.[169]\r\nIn addition to being the EXCELSIOR project officer, Kittinger was\r\nthe pilot and project engineer of STARGAZER which also utilized high\r\naltitude balloons.\r\n\r\nBy 1959, Kittinger was an integral part of both EXCELSIOR and STARGAZER\r\nand one of only three individuals in the Air Force with high altitude\r\nballoon pilot experience. Due to the hazardous nature of these\r\nimportant projects, Stapp was concerned that an injury to Kittinger\r\nmight result in the cancellation of one or both of them. Therefore,\r\nStapp determined there was a need for backup pilots. Selected as backup\r\npilots were Captains Dan D. Fulgham and William C. Kaufman. Both men\r\nwere rated aircraft pilots, parachutists, and research and development\r\nofficers assigned to the Aero Medical Laboratory at Wright-Patterson\r\nAFB.\r\n\r\nDuring the third week of May 1959, a series of low altitude manned\r\nballoon flights were flown to train Fulgham and Kaufman.[170] These\r\nflights were launched by the Holloman AFB Balloon Branch. To satisfy\r\nsafety requirements, the flights were closely monitored by medical\r\npersonnel at all times. A helicopter with medical personnel followed\r\nthe flights during daylight hours, a C-131 aircraft followed during\r\nhours of darkness, and at all times medical personnel followed in an\r\nambulance.[171] Balloon recovery and communications technicians also\r\nfollowed the missions on the ground in a communications vehicle and a\r\nballoon recovery vehicle.[172] The safety requirements were a result of\r\nseveral recent balloon mishaps that resulted in serious injuries to the\r\npilots.\r\n\r\nTo meet the training schedule, Kittinger, Kaufman and Fulgham were\r\nassigned temporary duty (TDY) from the Aero Medical Laboratory at\r\nWright-Patterson AFB to the Balloon Branch at Holloman AFB, N.M.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 16. In 1958 while training for the upcoming\r\n  U.S. Air Force Aero Medical Laboratory high altitude MAN HIGH III\r\n  balloon flight, balloon designer Otto C. Winzen (_right_) and\r\n  space physiologist Capt. Grover Schock (_left_), were seriously\r\n  injured in a balloon accident near Ashland, Wisc. Additionally,\r\n  two training flights at Holloman AFB also resulted in injuries to\r\n  pilots. These injuries prompted Air Force officials to require\r\n  close medical supervision during future training flights. (_photo\r\n  courtesy of Mike Smith, Raven Industries_)]\r\n\r\nThe three pilots, Kittinger, Kaufman and Fulgham, flew training\r\nmissions together. Kaufman and Fulgham alternately flew the balloon\r\nwhile Kittinger instructed. The missions were flown at night to take\r\nadvantage of light winds and avoid the effects of diurnal heating on\r\nthe helium (the lifting gas that filled the balloon). Used for these\r\nmissions were 30-foot diameter polyethylene balloons and an aluminum\r\ngondola especially designed for low altitude training.\r\n\r\nThe first training mission scheduled for May 19, 1959 was canceled due\r\nto equipment problems.[173] Problems overcome, the next day at 1:30\r\na.m. the mission launched from White Sands Proving Ground.[174] The\r\nobjective of this flight was to practice gas valving and ballasting\r\ntechniques necessary for balloon control and to practice landings.\r\nAfter a five-hour flight, the balloon landed without incident just\r\nafter sunrise northwest of El Paso, Texas.[175]\r\n\r\nThe second training flight, launched at 2:41 a.m. on May 21, 1959, from\r\nbehind the Balloon Branch building, Bldg. 850 at Holloman AFB.[176]\r\nNear the end of another successful training mission with the same\r\nobjectives as the previous flight, a mishap occurred resulting in\r\ninjuries to two of the pilots, Fulgham and Kittinger.[177]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 17. In May 1959, Capt. Dan D. Fulgham (_left_)\r\n  and Capt. William C. Kaufman, pilots and Aero Medical Research\r\n  officers from Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio were assigned temporary\r\n  duty to Holloman AFB, N.M. to train as high altitude balloon\r\n  pilots. Fulgham and Kaufman were trained by Capt. Joseph W.\r\n  Kittinger, Jr. (_photo collection of Dan D. Fulgham_)]\r\n\r\n=The Mishap.= Just after sunrise on May 21, 1959, following a\r\nsuccessful low level training flight east of Holloman AFB over the\r\nSacramento Mountains, Kittinger, the instructor pilot, determined\r\nthe balloon should be landed in a small field approximately 10 miles\r\nnorthwest of Roswell.[178] This was necessary because of approaching\r\nbad weather and the field was the last suitable landing site before\r\noverflying the city of Roswell.[179] When the balloon touched down,\r\na higher than normal forward velocity for landing caused the gondola\r\nto overturn.[180] The three pilots, Kittinger, Fulgham, and Kaufman,\r\nwere spilled from the gondola pinning Fulgham’s head between the edge\r\nof the gondola and the ground.[181] The impact shattered his helmet\r\nand he sustained a head injury.[182] When the three pilots climbed out\r\nfrom under the gondola, Fulgham noticed that his “head seemed to be\r\nprotruding outward from underneath [his] helmet.”[183] Kittinger also\r\nreceived an injury, a minor facial laceration. The crew of the nearby\r\nchase helicopter and personnel in the ground tracking vehicles rushed\r\nto the scene.[184] For medical treatment, the pilots were transported\r\nby the helicopter to nearby Walker AFB.[185]\r\n\r\nWhen the helicopter landed at Walker AFB, it was met by armed security\r\npersonnel who sought to verify the purpose of the unannounced\r\narrival.[186] The security personnel escorted the balloon pilots to\r\nthe hospital.[187] The balloon recovery and communications crew, after\r\nretrieving the gondola and balloon, drove to Walker AFB to check on the\r\ninjured crew and to inform the Balloon Branch at Holloman AFB of the\r\naccident.[188]\r\n\r\nAt the Walker AFB hospital, Fulgham and Kittinger received treatment\r\nfor their injuries and neither required admission. Meanwhile, the\r\nWalker AFB security officials continued to escort the unannounced\r\nvisitors while verifying their identities.[189] The pilot’s identities\r\nand purpose for their visit were confirmed via phone by Colonel Stapp,\r\nAero Medical Laboratory commander at Wright-Patterson AFB (the pilots\r\nand Project EXCELSIOR were assigned to this organization).[190]\r\n\r\nKittinger, the EXCELSIOR project officer, wanted to leave the\r\nhospital as quickly as possible after he and Fulgham received medical\r\nattention.[191] The quick departure was to avoid unwanted scrutiny by\r\nWalker AFB flying safety officials.[192] When released by the flight\r\nsurgeon, the three pilots boarded the chase helicopter and returned to\r\nHolloman AFB approximately 100 miles to the west.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 18. The balloon training missions flown from\r\n  Holloman AFB, N.M. in May 1959, were made in an open gondola\r\n  suspended beneath a 30-foot diameter polyethylene balloon.

Joseph W. Kittinger, Jr., now a retired Colonel.\r\nKittinger, who has red hair, was present at the Walker AFB hospital the\r\nentire time the events involving the balloon mishap took place. This\r\nis the second Roswell account that describes a captain with red hair.\r\nAs related in Section One of this report (see page 77 and Appendix\r\nC, page 194), a redheaded captain was also allegedly present at the\r\n“crashed saucer” site on the San Agustin Plains.[193] That account\r\nwas consistent with Kittinger’s responsibilities as the EXCELSIOR and\r\nSTARGAZER pilot and project officer. As project officer of two research\r\nprograms that utilized high altitude balloons and as a chase pilot on\r\nmany other high altitude balloon missions, Kittinger often accompanied\r\nballoon launch and recovery crews. He was present both on the ground\r\nand in the air at balloon launch and recovery locations throughout\r\nNew Mexico and the Southwest United States to launch and retrieve\r\nanthropomorphic dummies used for Project EXCELSIOR and unmanned test\r\ngondolas used for Project STARGAZER.[194]\r\n\r\nFollowing the accident, when the balloon pilots were transported to\r\nthe Walker AFB hospital for medical treatment, Kittinger wanted to\r\nleave as soon as possible.[195] He recalled in a recent interview that\r\nhis desire to quickly leave Walker AFB was to avoid the initiation\r\nof a formal accident investigation. He believed that an accident\r\ninvestigation might bring unwanted scrutiny to Project EXCELSIOR and\r\ndelay or even cancel the controversial project.[196] The controversy\r\nsurrounding Project EXCELSIOR was due principally to the hazardous\r\nnature of the high altitude escape research. Some senior research\r\nand development officials within the Air Force were reluctant to\r\nsupport a project that required a human subject to parachute from\r\na balloon gondola at over 100,000 feet. An accident investigation\r\nat this juncture would most likely delay the human high altitude\r\nfree-fall tests scheduled for the fall of 1959 and may have resulted in\r\ncancellation of the project.[197]\r\n\r\nWhile at the hospital, Kittinger consulted by phone with his commander,\r\nColonel Stapp.[198] Stapp agreed with Kittinger’s assessment that\r\na quick departure from the Walker AFB hospital, after receiving\r\nappropriate medical attention, was in the best interest of the\r\nproject.[199]\r\n\r\nThe statements attributed to the redheaded captain, “You did not see\r\nanything. There was no crash here. You don’t go into town making any\r\nrumors that you saw anything or that there was any crash,”[200] were\r\nconsistent with Kittinger’s desire to avoid an accident investigation.\r\nHowever, when interviewed for this report, neither Kittinger nor any\r\nof the other persons documented as having been present in the hospital\r\nthat day recalled encountering Dennis.[201]\r\n\r\nWhat may have led an uninformed person, such as Dennis, to believe\r\nthey were witnessing, or were told of, an unusual or classified event,\r\nwas that when the injured balloon pilots arrived at the Walker AFB\r\nhospital, even though Project EXCELSIOR was unclassified, Kittinger\r\nsought to limit disclosure of negative information and publicity.[202]\r\n\r\nBy 1959, having been the subject of intense media scrutiny following\r\nhis June 1957 MAN HIGH I high altitude balloon flight, Kittinger\r\nwas aware of both the positive and negative aspects of publicity.\r\nIn his 1961 book, _The Long, Lonely Leap_, Kittinger described this\r\nself-imposed secrecy regarding Project EXCELSIOR, “The secrecy imposed\r\nupon EXCELSIOR was of our own choosing. We believed ... that any\r\nunnecessary conversation about our activities ... would simply be\r\npremature.”[203] When interviewed for this report, Kittinger further\r\nexplained of Project EXCELSIOR and the visit to the hospital at Walker\r\nAFB: “We didn’t want publicity ... about anything we were doing. So it\r\nwould have appeared to someone not conversant with the project that we\r\nwere ‘hush-hush,’ that we were secretive ... it might look like we were\r\ntrying to cover up a classified mission.”[204]\r\n\r\nThe allegations that the redheaded captain, an apparent reference to\r\nKittinger, threatened anyone while he was at the Walker AFB hospital\r\nare untrue. When interviewed for this report and in signed statements\r\nobtained from Kittinger, the two other balloon pilots, the doctor who\r\ntreated them, the medic aboard the helicopter, and the Balloon Branch\r\ncommunications technician who were present at the hospital that day\r\n(see Appendix B), none of them recalled that Kittinger was involved in\r\nan altercation or made threatening remarks to anyone.[205] Involvement\r\nin an altercation with a civilian would have highlighted the presence\r\nof the balloon crew and possibly brought the type of negative\r\npublicity Kittinger sought to avoid. This would not only have violated\r\nKittinger’s policy of maintaining a low profile in regard to EXCELSIOR,\r\nbut would be completely out of character for the seasoned test pilot.\r\n\r\nThroughout his career, Kittinger was renowned for his ability\r\nto maintain his composure in difficult, often life threatening,\r\nsituations. He faced these situations as a test pilot, as a combat\r\npilot and squadron commander in Southeast Asia, and as a Prisoner\r\nof War while subjected to severe torture at the hands of the North\r\nVietnamese. In _The Pre-Astronauts_, which chronicles many of\r\nKittinger’s accomplishments in the field of aeronautics, including\r\nProject EXCELSIOR and STARGAZER, the author offered the following\r\ndescription of him:\r\n\r\n  _Kittinger was not Buck Rogers, nor was he a daredevil or\r\n  thrill-seeker. He was a modern day test pilot: intense, focused,\r\n  usually quiet, and always polite with firm religious convictions\r\n  and a powerful sense of loyalty. If he was often stubborn,\r\n  uncompromising, and demanding he also dealt fairly and respectfully\r\n  with those who came into contact with him. He was a straight arrow\r\n  and a straight shooter._[206]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 19. Maj. Joseph W. Kittinger, Jr. in 1963 as a\r\n  member of the 1st Air Commando Wing, Ben Hoa, Republic of Vietnam.\r\n  (_U.S. Air Force photo_)]\r\n\r\n\r\n             Colonel Joseph W. Kittinger, Jr., USAF (Ret)\r\n\r\n  Colonel Joseph W. Kittinger, Jr.’s career in the U.S. Air Force\r\n  and in aviation has spanned the spectrum of experiences: test\r\n  pilot, balloon pilot, test parachutist, combat fighter pilot, MiG\r\n  killer, combat squadron commander, and prisoner of war. He has\r\n  demonstrated, during a nearly 30-year military career and beyond,\r\n  that he is among the very best in the U.S. Air Force and the field\r\n  of aeronautics.\r\n\r\n  Kittinger began his career in 1949 as a U.S. Air Force aviation\r\n  cadet. After earning his wings at Las Vegas AFB, Nev. in March\r\n  1950, he was assigned to fighter squadrons in Germany and then as\r\n  a test pilot for NATO. In 1953, Kittinger received an assignment\r\n  as a test pilot to Holloman AFB, N.M. While at Holloman, he began\r\n  a many year collaboration with the legendary Air Force scientist\r\n  and physician, Col. John P. Stapp. In association with Stapp on\r\n  numerous aero medical projects, Kittinger became the first pilot\r\n  to fly zero-gravity experiments, now commonly used for astronaut\r\n  training. For project MAN HIGH on June 2, 1957, Kittinger piloted a\r\n  high altitude balloon to 96,000 feet to examine the physiological\r\n  and psychological effects on man in a space equivalent environment.\r\n  This flight marked the origins of the manned U.S. space program\r\n  with the experience gained from MAN HIGH being incorporated in\r\n  NASA’s Project MERCURY.\r\n\r\n  After MAN HIGH, and again in association with Stapp, Kittinger\r\n  directed Project EXCELSIOR, a study of human free-fall\r\n  characteristics following aircraft escape at extremely high\r\n  altitudes. After extensive testing with anthropomorphic dummies,\r\n  Kittinger made three parachute jumps from high altitude balloons:\r\n  76,400 feet on November 16, 1959; 74,700 feet on December 11,\r\n  1959; and 102,800 feet on August 16, 1960. For these courageous\r\n  scientific achievements Kittinger was awarded the Distinguished\r\n  Flying Cross, the Harmon Trophy by President Eisenhower, the\r\n  still-standing world records for highest parachute jump and length\r\n  of a free-fall—and the distinction of being the only living person\r\n  to exceed the speed of sound without an aircraft or spacecraft!\r\n\r\n  With the completion of EXCELSIOR, Kittinger became the pilot,\r\n  project officer, and project engineer for STARGAZER, an\r\n  astronomical observation experiment. This was the third and final\r\n  Air Force manned high altitude balloon project, Kittinger had flown\r\n  in all three.\r\n\r\n  In 1963, he was assigned to the Air Commandos (now Special\r\n  Operations) and flew two combat tours in Southeast Asia in B-26\r\n  and A-26 aircraft. After a tour in Germany as a liaison officer\r\n  with the U.S. Army Special Forces, Kittinger returned to Southeast\r\n  Asia in 1971, flying F-4 aircraft and commanding the famous 555th\r\n  “Triple Nickel” Tactical Fighter Squadron at Udorn AB, Thailand. On\r\n  March 1, 1972 Kittinger engaged and destroyed a MiG-21 over North\r\n  Vietnam and is credited with an aerial victory. On May 11, 1972,\r\n  after 483 combat missions and more than 1,000 combat flying hours,\r\n  Kittinger was shot down over Hanoi and spent 11 months as a POW in\r\n  the infamous “Hanoi Hilton.” When placed with other POWs following\r\n  solitary confinement and severe torture, Kittinger was moved\r\n  repeatedly by his North Vietnamese captors due to his effectiveness\r\n  in motivating other prisoners to maintain strong resistance\r\n  postures.\r\n\r\n  Kittinger retired from the Air Force in 1978 and became involved\r\n  in both sport aircraft flying and gas ballooning. He operated\r\n  Rosie O’Grady’s Flying Circus in his hometown of Orlando, Fla.,\r\n  performing skywriting, banner towing, and hot air and helium\r\n  balloon demonstrations at nearby Walt Disney World. He also\r\n  captured the coveted Gordon Bennett Gas Balloon Championship an\r\n  unprecedented four times (three consecutive), entitling him to\r\n  retire the trophy.\r\n\r\n  In September 1984, Kittinger made history again, when, in the\r\n  tradition of Lindbergh, he became the first person to make a solo\r\n  crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by balloon.\r\n\r\n  Kittinger’s military decorations include the Silver Star with\r\n  one oak leaf cluster, Legion of Merit with one oak leaf cluster,\r\n  Distinguished Flying Cross with five oak leaf clusters, Bronze Star\r\n  Medal with “V” device and two oak leaf clusters, Air Medal with\r\n  23 oak leaf clusters, Purple Heart with one oak leaf cluster, POW\r\n  medal, and the Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Palm.\r\n\r\n  Kittinger’s indomitable spirit, personal courage and dedication to\r\n  duty are legendary. His ability to achieve seemingly unattainable\r\n  objectives while earning the respect and absolute loyalty of those\r\n  who served with him defines this rare breed of warrior-leader.\r\n\r\n  In October 1995, he received yet another honor and was named a\r\n  recipient of the prestigious “Elder Statesman of Aviation” award by\r\n  the National Aeronautics Association. This honor is bestowed upon\r\n  an individual who over a period of years, has made “significant\r\n  contributions to aeronautics” and for “reflecting credit upon\r\n  himself and America.” Without a doubt, there are few that exemplify\r\n  these virtues more than this truly distinctive American, Joseph W.\r\n  Kittinger, Jr.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Wreckage” in the Rear of the Ambulance\r\n\r\nThe various types of wreckage described in the rear of an ambulance at\r\nthe Walker AFB hospital also appear to be related to the 1959 balloon\r\naccident. Some of this wreckage allegedly had odd inscriptions, touted\r\nby UFO theorists as “alien” hieroglyphics.\r\n\r\nA requirement of balloon pilot training missions were that they be\r\nclosely monitored by balloon recovery and medical personnel.[207]\r\nGround crews from Holloman AFB followed the balloon flight from\r\nits launch site there to its landing site 10 miles northwest of\r\nRoswell.[208] Two of the vehicles that followed the balloon were Dodge\r\nM-43 ¾-ton field ambulances and a third was an M-37 ¾-ton utility\r\nvehicle or “weapons carrier.”[209] One ambulance was assigned to this\r\nmission for its standard use—a medical response vehicle. The other\r\nambulance had been converted by the Holloman AFB Balloon Branch and\r\nserved as a communications vehicle on balloon recovery missions.[210]\r\nThe additional communications equipment, mounted in the rear\r\ncompartment of the ambulance, drastically altered what someone expected\r\nto see in an ambulance of this type.\r\n\r\nDennis related that he was walking fast when he observed what he\r\nthought was wreckage in the rear of an ambulance.[211] This quick\r\nglance apparently resulted in descriptions of two pieces of wreckage\r\nleaning against the interior of the rear compartment of the ambulance\r\nthat “was kind of like the bottom of a canoe ... like stainless steel\r\n... with kind of a bluish-purplish tinge to it.”[212] UFO theorists\r\nhave suggested that these objects were alien spaceship “escape pods”\r\nrecovered by the Army Air Forces. However, this appears to be a\r\nremarkably accurate description of two steel panels painted Air Force\r\nblue on a converted ambulance used by the Balloon Branch for this\r\nmission.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 20. Balloon Branch Communications Technician,\r\n  A2C Ole Jorgeson, now a retired Master Sergeant, in the rear\r\n  compartment of an M-43 ambulance. Ambulances of this type were\r\n  converted by the Balloon Branch to communications vehicles in\r\n  the late 1950s. It appears the witness described the two panels\r\n  painted Air Force blue (_lower right and left of ambulance_)\r\n  as “bluish-purplish” “wreckage” that looked “kinda like the\r\n  bottom of a canoe” and the stenciled writing above them as\r\n  “hieroglyphics”—See figs. 21 and 22 on next page. (_photo\r\n  collection of Ole Jorgeson_)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 21. (_Above_) Enlargement of stenciled writing\r\n  from photograph below. This lettering was apparently later\r\n  described as “hieroglyphics.”]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 22. (_Below_) Steel panels painted Air Force\r\n  blue (_lower right and left_) described as “bluish-purplish”\r\n  “wreckage” that looked “kinda like the bottom of a canoe.” (_U.S.\r\n  Air Force photo_)]\r\n\r\nThe “inscription or something,”[213] the so called “hieroglyphics,”\r\nwere a probable reference to the lettering painted on the equipment\r\nsupport rack above the panels. The lettering on the rack would be\r\nvisible, but probably not readable, to an observer that quickly walked\r\npast the ambulance. Other wreckage “all over the floor” that was “like\r\nbroken glass,”[214] was a probable reference to the clear plastic\r\n30-foot polyethylene balloon that was recovered following the balloon\r\ntraining mission and placed in the back of the converted ambulance or\r\nthe weapons carrier for later disposal.\r\n\r\nDennis also recalled that he parked the vehicle he was driving\r\nnear three field ambulances and then walked up the ramp into the\r\nhospital.[215] The description of ambulances near a “ramp” is\r\nconsistent with the recollections of the Balloon Branch Communication\r\nTechnician who drove the converted ambulance to the Walker AFB hospital\r\nfollowing the balloon accident. While waiting for the injured pilots,\r\nA2C Ole Jorgeson, now a retired Master Sergeant, recalled in a recent\r\ninterview that he parked the converted ambulance near a ramp at the\r\nhospital.[216] A review of Walker AFB hospital records revealed\r\nthat there was only one ramp. The ramp was attached to the hospital\r\ndispensary, Walker AFB Bldg. 317.[217] The other ambulances described\r\nby the witness were either the other ambulance from Holloman AFB that\r\nprovided medical support of the balloon flight or the two “standby”\r\nambulances, that in May 1959, were routinely positioned adjacent to the\r\nramp behind the dispensary at Walker AFB.[218]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 23. “It was all sharp ... like broken glass,”\r\n  a witness’ description of debris in the rear of an ambulance at\r\n  Walker AFB. The debris described was most probably the remnants\r\n  of the polyethylene balloon, similar to the one in this photo,\r\n  recovered by Balloon Branch personnel following the mishap in May\r\n  1959. (_U.S. Air Force photo_) ]\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Security at the Walker AFB Hospital\r\n\r\nThe witness described what appeared to be a heightened state of\r\nsecurity at the hospital when he allegedly took the injured airman\r\nthere for treatment. UFO theorists contend the heightened security at\r\nthe hospital was because alien remains were being autopsied. However,\r\nit appears that the witness described the security measures taken by\r\nWalker AFB personnel due to the unusual circumstances of the arrival of\r\nthe balloon crew.\r\n\r\nIn 1959, Walker AFB was a part of the 47th Air Division of Strategic\r\nAir Command (SAC). It was home of the 6th Bombardment Wing (6th BW),\r\nequipped with the nuclear capable B-52 Stratofortress bomber (the\r\n509th BW was reassigned to Pease AFB, NH on July 1, 1958).[219] The\r\nmission of the 6th BW, to strike the enemy with nuclear weapons\r\nanywhere in the world at a moment’s notice, demanded a heightened state\r\nof security at all times. One of the methods instituted during this\r\nperiod to maintain the high standards of security and effectiveness\r\nof SAC units, was unannounced “surprise” visits of Headquarters SAC\r\ninspection teams. A favored method of transportation for these surprise\r\nvisits was a helicopter. When a SAC inspection team landed at a base,\r\noften the first evaluation they made was of the security response to\r\ntheir unannounced arrival. Failure of security personnel to properly\r\nchallenge unidentified visitors, regardless of their method of arrival,\r\nwas considered a serious breach of security.\r\n\r\nWhen transported to Walker AFB for medical treatment, unexpected and at\r\nan early hour, the balloon crew, not surprisingly, was met by armed\r\nsecurity personnel.[220] The security personnel escorted them to the\r\nhospital and remained with them until their identities and purpose of\r\ntheir visit were verified. Kaufman, one of the balloon pilots, recalled\r\nthat their presence at Walker AFB was initially met with skepticism.\r\n\r\n“The [helicopter] pilot called the tower and said ... having come from\r\nan experimental base, it was nothing unusual for him to have a balloon\r\naccident. ‘We’ve got an injured pilot on board. There’s been a balloon\r\naccident and we would like the flight surgeon and an ambulance to meet\r\nus at the tower.’ The tower established the fact that yes, we were an\r\nAir Force chopper and that we seemed to have somebody injured and what\r\nhad we been doing? We had been shooting touch and go landings in a\r\nballoon?... We got clearance to land ... right in front of the tower,\r\nand we were met by an ambulance and several MPs with machine guns.”[221]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 24. Walker AFB Building 317, hospital\r\n  dispensary with attached ramp, as it appeared in June 1954. It is\r\n  in this building that UFO theorists allege that “alien autopsies”\r\n  were accomplished in July 1947. However, this was the same building\r\n  that Capt. Fulgham received treatment following the balloon\r\n  accident on May 21, 1959. Persons apparently observed him and later\r\n  related the unusual circumstances surrounding the balloon mishap as\r\n  part of the “Roswell Incident.” (_U.S. Air Force photo_)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 25. Main gate at Walker AFB, N.M., formerly\r\n  Roswell AAF, as it appeared in 1954. During the 1950s, the highly\r\n  secure base was the home of the nuclear capable 509th and 6th\r\n  Bombardment Wings of Strategic Air Command. (_U.S. Air Force\r\n  photo_)]\r\n\r\nAccording to the medical technician who arrived on the helicopter\r\nwith the pilots, he had difficulty persuading a flight surgeon to\r\nattend to the injured pilots. SSgt. Roland H. “Hap” Lutz, now a\r\nretired Chief Master Sergeant, recalled when he first contacted the\r\nWalker AFB hospital explaining that he had three persons injured in a\r\n“gondola accident,” the flight surgeon told him to “Go home and sleep\r\nit off.”[222] Fulgham, the injured pilot, recalled that when they got\r\nto the hospital, “there was this controversy going on in the hospital\r\nabout who in the hell we were ... we weren’t supposed to be there and\r\nnobody knew anything about Air Force officers flying balloons ... we\r\ncould have been ... [trying] to penetrate the security.”[223] Walker\r\nAFB security officials were satisfied of the pilots’ identities when\r\nthey spoke to Colonel Stapp, commander of the Aero Medical Laboratory\r\nat Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 26. Capt. Joseph W. Kittinger, Jr. (_right_),\r\n  is shown here in 1962 with Dr. J. Allen Hynek while preparing for\r\n  the project STARGAZER high altitude balloon flight. (_U.S. Air\r\n  Force photo_)]\r\n\r\n\r\n            The “Red-headed Captain” and Dr. J. Allen Hynek\r\n\r\n  Captain Kittinger, the STARGAZER high altitude balloon pilot and\r\n  project engineer, had extensive professional contact with Dr.\r\n  J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer and STARGAZER project scientist.\r\n  Additionally, Hynek was also one of the scientific consultants in\r\n  the Air Force study of UFOs, Project BLUEBOOK. Hynek is best known,\r\n  however, for his apparent endorsement of extraterrestrial theories\r\n  concerning UFOs after concluding his associations with the Air\r\n  Force.\r\n\r\n  When asked about his recollections of Hynek, Kittinger stated\r\n  that when they were associated, from 1958 to 1963, they discussed\r\n  UFOs at length.[224] At that time, Hynek was steadfast in his\r\n  opinion that most, if not all, UFO sightings could be resolved by\r\n  applying known scientific analysis.[225] Kittinger said he was\r\n  “flabbergasted” when, years later, Hynek appeared to reverse his\r\n  opinion and endorse extraterrestrial explanations.[226] Hynek’s\r\n  reversal in philosophies led to numerous commercial endeavors, most\r\n  notably as a technical advisor for the science-fiction film _Close\r\n  Encounters of the Third Kind_.\r\n\r\n  Also, based on his experience with project STARGAZER, Hynek was\r\n  familiar with balloon operations at Holloman AFB, visiting the\r\n  Holloman Balloon Branch several times.[227] Interestingly, there\r\n  is no record that Hynek, who died in 1986, ever endorsed what is\r\n  now presented as the “best evidence” of UFOs, the so-called Roswell\r\n  Incident, which was actually a conglomeration of numerous events,\r\n  some with origins in Holloman AFB launched balloons.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Alien at the Hospital\r\n\r\nIn at least one account of the Roswell Incident, a witness claimed he\r\nobserved a “creature” walk under its own power into the hospital.[228]\r\nWhile the specifics of this particular sighting cannot be verified,\r\nthe injury that caused Fulgham’s head to swell, resembling the classic\r\nscience-fiction alien head, makes this account (and some others) that\r\nat first appeared to be the work of over-active imaginations, seem\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 27.

REGISTER NUMBER\r\n  16059\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen the balloon gondola struck Fulgham’s head, he received, according\r\nto his clinical record from May 21, 1959, an “Extensive hematoma\r\nforehead and ant [anterior] scalp.”[229] A hematoma is a localized\r\nblood-filled swelling, that in this instance was on the forehead. The\r\nhematoma resulted in immediate facial swelling, two black eyes and\r\nlater caused his skin to turn yellow.[230]\r\n\r\nThe rapid onset of the swelling caused both of Fulgham’s eyes to\r\nclose. As it progressed, according to Kittinger who accompanied\r\nFulgham at the hospital, “His whole face had swollen up and his\r\nnose barely protruded.”[231] This appearance lead Kittinger to\r\ncharacterize Fulgham’s appearance at the time as “just a big blob” and\r\n“grotesque.”[232]\r\n\r\nWhen interviewed, Fulgham remembered that even though he didn’t feel\r\nbad, “I didn’t know how bad I looked.” There was no attempt to hide\r\nor limit Fulgham’s exposure to persons in the hospital that day. In\r\nfact, when he arrived at the hospital Fulgham recalled that he stopped\r\noutside the building to smoke a cigarette. Kaufman also recalled that\r\nthe injured pilots, Fulgham and Kittinger, waited for treatment on a\r\nbench in the hallway of the hospital. Kaufman added that a number of\r\nmilitary wives were present in the hospital that day for prenatal care,\r\nand there was no effort to keep Fulgham from their view.[233]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig 28. Capt. Dan D. Fulgham at Wright-Patterson\r\n  AFB, Ohio several days after the balloon accident with a “traumatic\r\n  hematoma” on his forehead. This photo shows Fulgham after blood\r\n  had been aspirated from under his scalp and a substantial amount\r\n  of swelling had dissipated. Concerns that Fulgham’s odd appearance\r\n  might startle uninformed persons was why he was returned to\r\n  Wright-Patterson AFB aboard a specially arranged flight from\r\n  Holloman AFB, N.M. (_photo collection of Dan D. Fulgham_)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=“Bodies” with Large Heads and Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio=\r\n\r\nUFO theorists contend that the U.S. Army Air Forces secretly shipped\r\nthe alien bodies with large heads to Wright-Patterson AFB for further\r\nprocessing and deep-freeze storage. However, it is likely that, in this\r\naccount, this is a reference to Fulgham’s return to Wright-Patterson\r\nAFB following the balloon mishap.\r\n\r\nAlthough Fulgham did not require hospitalization at Walker AFB, upon\r\nhis return to Holloman AFB he was admitted to the base hospital for\r\nobservation. Three days later on May 24, 1959, the balloon pilots were\r\nflown from Holloman to Wright-Patterson AFB on a specially arranged\r\nflight aboard a C-131 hospital aircraft.[234]\r\n\r\nThe return to Wright-Patterson AFB was directed by Stapp and\r\ncoordinated by Kittinger.[235] The preliminary arrangements for this\r\nflight were made by Kittinger while at the Walker AFB hospital.[236]\r\nKittinger recalled that conversations with Stapp regarding their\r\nreturn to Wright-Patterson AFB were made by phone in busy areas of the\r\nhospital and these conversations could have been overheard by nearly\r\nanyone present.[237]\r\n\r\nUpon their arrival at Wright-Patterson, Fulgham, who Kittinger did not\r\nwant to transport on a commercial flight due to his odd appearance,\r\nstill could not open his eyes and had to be led down the steps of the\r\naircraft. Kittinger recalled that Fulgham’s wife was waiting at the\r\nbottom of the aircraft steps when they arrived.\r\n\r\n“They dropped the ramp and I looked down at the bottom and there was\r\nDan Fulgham’s wife,” Kittinger said. “Dan couldn’t see ... so I grabbed\r\nhim by the arm ... Dan’s wife sees me leading this blob down the\r\nstaircase ... and she looks right at me and says, ‘Where’s my husband?’\r\nI said, ‘Ma’am, this is your husband’. I presented her this blob that I\r\nwas leading down the ramp. And she let out this scream you could hear a\r\nmile away. He was such a horrendous looking thing that she had no idea\r\nthat the thing I was leading down that ramp was her husband.”[238]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 29. As a physiologist for the space program,\r\n  Fulgham (_third from left_) discusses Project GEMINI emergency\r\n  escape systems at the U.S. Navy Aerospace Recovery facility at\r\n  El Centro, Calif. on January 28, 1965. Shown with Fulgham (_from\r\n  left_) are NASA astronaut Jim Lovell, NASA project engineer Hilary\r\n  Ray, and NASA astronaut Alan Bean. (_U.S. Navy photo_)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 30. A veteran of 100 combat missions during the\r\n  Korean conflict, Fulgham flew 133 combat missions in F-4 aircraft\r\n  (shown here) in 1966–67 as a member of the 555th “Triple Nickel”\r\n  Tactical Fighter Squadron at Ubon Air Base, Thailand. (_photo\r\n  collection of Dan D. Fulgham_)]\r\n\r\nFulgham recalled that upon his return to work at the Aero Medical\r\nLaboratory he received reactions of “immediate compassionate sympathy”\r\nfrom persons he encountered, including his secretary, who cried when\r\nshe saw him.[239] Within several weeks, Fulgham returned to flying\r\nstatus with no permanent effects. Fulgham went on to complete a\r\ndistinguished career in the Air Force and retired as a colonel in 1978.\r\nFulgham’s assignments included combat tours in fighter aircraft in\r\nboth Korea and Vietnam, as well as an assignment as an experimental\r\nparachutist and physiologist for the space program.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Summary\r\n\r\nIn this section, documented research revealed that the reports of\r\n“bodies” at the Roswell AAF hospital were grossly inaccurate and most\r\nprobably had origins in actual Air Force mishaps. Examinations of\r\nofficial records of the alleged primary witnesses revealed that the\r\n“missing nurse” was never missing, and the pediatrician did not arrive\r\nat the Walker AFB hospital until 1951—four years _after_ the alleged\r\nincident. The many fundamental errors in the story, combined with the\r\nsubstantial similarities to the actual mishaps, show that the most\r\ncredible account associated with the “Roswell Incident” is certainly\r\nnot extraterrestrial and is unrelated to any events that occurred in\r\nJuly 1947.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Conclusion\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen critically examined, the claims that the U.S. Army Air Forces\r\nrecovered a flying saucer and alien crew in 1947, were found to be\r\na compilation of many verifiable events. For the most part, the\r\ndescriptions collected by UFO theorists were of actual operations and\r\ntests carried out by the U.S. Air Force in the 1950s. Despite the\r\nusual unsavory accusations by UFO proponents of cover-up, conspiracy,\r\nintimidation, etc., documented research revealed that many of the\r\nactivities were actually historic scientific achievements of which the\r\nAir Force is very proud. However, other descriptions are believed to be\r\ndistorted references to Air Force members who were killed or injured in\r\nthe line of duty. The incomplete and inaccurate intermingling of these\r\nactual events were grounded in just enough fact to weave a sensational\r\nstory, but cannot withstand close scrutiny when compared to official\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\nTo analyze reports of alien bodies that at first appeared to be so\r\noffbeat as to not be remotely based in fact, it was necessary to\r\nevaluate a wide range of books, interviews, videos, etc., that a\r\nless objective review might have rejected out of hand. Only through\r\nan inclusive evaluation of these sources were Air Force researchers\r\nable to understand the interconnectivity of the widely separated\r\nevents believed responsible for this “incident.” And, in opposition\r\nto critics who believe Air Force research involving this subject is\r\nanything but objective, this research relied almost exclusively on\r\nthe descriptions _=provided by the UFO proponents themselves=_. When\r\ncollected and examined, the actual statements of the witnesses—not\r\nthe extraterrestrial interpretations of UFO proponents—indicated that\r\nsomething was very wrong. When these descriptions were compared to\r\ndocumented Air Force activities, they were much too similar to be a\r\ncoincidence. Soon, it became apparent that the witnesses or the UFO\r\nproponents who liberally interpreted their statements were either 1)\r\nconfused, or 2) attempting to perpetrate a hoax, believing that no\r\nserious efforts would ever be taken to verify their stories.\r\n\r\nIn preparing this report, attempts were made not to only explain\r\n_what_ conclusions were reached, but _how_ they were reached. This\r\nundertaking was to try to de-mystify the research process by outlining\r\nthe simple and logical research techniques that identified the\r\nunderlying actual events. In regard to statements of witnesses that\r\nwere clearly descriptions of Air Force activities, such as those\r\nthat described anthropomorphic dummies, these could be generously\r\nviewed as situational misunderstandings or even honest mistakes.\r\nOther descriptions, particularly those believed to be thinly veiled\r\nreferences to deceased or injured Air Force members, are difficult\r\nto view as naive misunderstandings. Any attempt to misrepresent or\r\ncapitalize on tragic incidents in which Air Force members died or were\r\ninjured in service to their country significantly alters what would\r\notherwise be viewed as simple misinterpretations or honest mistakes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 31.

(_U.S. Air Force photo_)]\r\n\r\nFinally, after reviewing this report, some persons may legitimately ask\r\nwhy the Air Force expended time and effort to respond to mythical, if\r\nnot comedic, allegations of recoveries of “flying saucers” and “space\r\naliens.” The answer to those persons is:\r\n\r\n  • Initially the Air Force was required to respond to an official\r\n  request from the General Accounting Office.\r\n\r\n  • High altitude balloon research, aircraft escape systems, and\r\n  other technologies that were misrepresented as part of the Roswell\r\n  Incident, accounted for significant contributions to the knowledge\r\n  of the atmosphere, to the quest for space flight, and to the\r\n  defense of this nation. The U.S. Air Force is exceedingly proud of\r\n  these accomplishments. Distorted and incomplete descriptions of\r\n  these activities do not pay tribute to these important exploits\r\n  or to the individuals who, often at great personal risk, boldly\r\n  carried them out.\r\n\r\n  • A sobering reality of the mission of the U.S. Air Force, as\r\n  evidenced by the aircraft mishaps described in this report, is\r\n  that defending this nation is a dangerous profession. On a daily\r\n  basis, members of the U.S. Air Force perform hazardous missions in\r\n  many locations throughout the world. Unfortunately, these missions\r\n  sometimes result in injuries or deaths. It is the right—and indeed\r\n  the duty—of the Air Force to challenge those who attempt to exploit\r\n  these human tragedies wherever, and whenever, they are discovered.\r\n\r\n  • The misrepresentations of Air Force activities as an\r\n  extraterrestrial “incident” is misleading to the public and is\r\n  simply an affront to the truth.\r\n\r\nThis comprehensive further examination of the so-called “Roswell\r\nIncident” found no evidence whatsoever of flying saucers, space aliens,\r\nor sinister government cover-ups. But, even if unintentionally, it did\r\nserve to highlight a series of events that embody the proud history of\r\nthe finest air force in the world—the U.S. Air Force. The actual events\r\nexamined here, rich in human and scientific triumph, tempered by the\r\nstark realities of the dangers of the Air Force mission, are but one\r\nsmall portion of that history. The many Air Force activities cobbled\r\ntogether in the ever changing collage that has become the “Roswell\r\nIncident,” when examined in the clear light of historical research,\r\nrevealed a remarkable chapter of the Air Force story. In the final\r\nanalysis, this examination simply illustrates once again, that fact is\r\nindeed stranger, and often much more fascinating, than fiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Notes - Section One\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Headquarters United States Air Force, _The Roswell Report: Fact vs.\r\nFiction in the New Mexico Desert_ (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government\r\nPrinting Office, 1995), 20–22.\r\n\r\n[2] ibid.\r\n\r\n[3] Don Berliner and Stanton T.

Clouthier, hereby state that James McAndrew, was\r\n  identified as a Captain, USAFR on this date at my place of\r\n  employment do hereby, voluntarily and of my own free will, make the\r\n  following statement. This was done without having been subjected to\r\n  any coercion, unlawful influence or unlawful inducement.\r\n\r\n  I was on active duty in the US Air Force and stationed at Walker\r\n  AFB, Roswell, NM, from February 1955 until October 1956. During that\r\n  time I was a pharmacist assigned to the base hospital. Following\r\n  my tour of duty with the Air Force, I returned to my hometown,\r\n  Farmington, NM, where I became an employee and eventually a\r\n  co-owner of Farmington Drug.\r\n\r\n  With the exception of the two years in the US Air Force, I have\r\n  been a resident of Farmington, NM since 1934. It is my recollection\r\n  that Dr Frank B. Nordstrom was the first pediatrician to practice\r\n  in the Farmington area and he remained the only pediatrician in\r\n  Farmington until approximately 1970. I base these recollections on\r\n  extensive professional and personal contacts with physicians in the\r\n  Farmington area and as a father of two children who were patients\r\n  of Dr Nordstrom’s.\r\n\r\n  Also based on nearly 40 years of contact with physicians in the\r\n  Farmington area, I believe that Dr Nordstrom is the only physician\r\n  who served a tour of duty at Walker AFB. During the 1960s, I\r\n  became aware that Dr Nordstrom had also served at the Walker AFB\r\n  hospital. At various times in the ensuing years. Dr Nordstrom\r\n  and I reminisced about our service at Walker AFB. During these\r\n  conversations Dr Nordstrom never mentioned any activities during\r\n  his tour of duty I considered unusual or that might explain reports\r\n  of bodies or aliens. During the time I was stationed at Walker AFB,\r\n  I did not witness, nor did I hear rumors, of anything that involved\r\n  flying saucers, aliens, or anything else of an extraterrestrial\r\n  nature.\r\n\r\n  I am not part of a conspiracy to withhold information from either\r\n  the US government or the American public. There is no classified\r\n  information that I am withholding related to this inquiry, and I\r\n  have not been threatened by US government persons concerning not\r\n  talking about this matter.\r\n\r\n  SIGNED:                       Subscribed and sworn before a\r\n                                person authorized to administer oaths\r\n                                this 26th day of April 1996 at\r\n                                Farmington, NM\r\n\r\n  [Signature]                   [Signature]\r\n  Charles E.

Coltman, Jr., Col, USAF, MC (Ret), hereby state that\r\n  James McAndrew was identified as a Lieutenant, USAFR, on this date\r\n  at my place of employment and do hereby, voluntarily and of my own\r\n  free will, make the following statement. This was done without\r\n  having been subjected to any coercion, unlawful influence or\r\n  unlawful inducement.\r\n\r\n  I entered the U.S. Air Force in 1957 as a flight surgeon and was\r\n  assigned to Walker AFB, NM, in 1958. Following a residency at Ohio\r\n  State University from 1959 to 1963, I was assigned to Wilford Hall\r\n  USAF Medical Center, Lackland AFB, TX, where I eventually became\r\n  the Chairman of the Department of Medicine. I retired from the Air\r\n  Force in 1977. I am presently a Professor at The University of\r\n  Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, and Chief Executive\r\n  Officer of the Cancer Therapy and Research Foundation of South\r\n  Texas.\r\n\r\n  I remember a balloon crash that happened north of Roswell, NM, in\r\n  May, 1959. I received a phone call from the NCOIC of the Flight\r\n  Surgeon’s office, who informed me of the crash. The NCOIC, Earl\r\n  Wormwood, came to my quarters and we drove, in an old blue Air\r\n  Force “crackerbox” ambulance, to the crash site. I remember the\r\n  gondola laying on its side and the deflated balloon on the ground.\r\n  The crew members were sitting next to the gondola. I examined the\r\n  pilots and determined they were not seriously injured. They told me\r\n  they were practicing touch-and-go’s and a gust of wind had dumped\r\n  them on the ground, and the gondola had struck one of the pilots\r\n  in the head. Also present were Air Force technicians in trucks who\r\n  tracked the balloon. The injured pilots were transported to the\r\n  Flight Surgeon’s office at the hospital at Walker AFB.\r\n\r\n  The injury sustained by the crew member was a head\r\n  abrasion/contusion and a hemotoma. The hemotoma caused the\r\n  patient’s head to swell, however, it was not serious enough for\r\n  him to be admitted. I remember receiving a call from Col (Dr.)\r\n  John Stapp. He was in charge of the balloon project and was quite\r\n  famous. Dr Stapp inquired about the injuries to the pilots and he\r\n  wanted them returned to Holloman AFB as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n  The hospital was an old World War II cantonment-type building with\r\n  long corridors and a capacity of fifty beds. I do not recall a\r\n  nurse assisting me in the treatment of the patient, although a\r\n  nurse may have been on duty and observed the patient. I was the\r\n  only doctor in the hospital that morning. There were no visiting\r\n  doctors from other bases or facilities. I do not remember any\r\n  altercations or arguments that day. During my time at Walker, I do\r\n  not recall that any autopsies were performed at the hospital, since\r\n  we did not have a pathologist on staff. I do not recall any remains\r\n  brought to the hospital in body bags, or wreckage transported in\r\n  the back of an ambulance. There may have been remains brought to\r\n  the hospital in body bags after a KC-97 crash, but that was before\r\n  I arrived at Walker. Dr Ed Bradley was involved in the recovery of\r\n  the remains.\r\n\r\n  At no time was there ever any involvement of the Walker hospital\r\n  with UFO’s or “space aliens” I know this to be true because the\r\n  hospital was very small and had a small staff.

Fulgham, Col, USAF (Ret), hereby state that James\r\n  McAndrew was identified as a Lieutenant, USAFR on this date at my\r\n  place of employment and do hereby, voluntarily and of my own free\r\n  will, make the following statement. This was done without having\r\n  been subjected to any coercion, unlawful influence or unlawful\r\n  inducement.\r\n\r\n  I entered the U.S. Air Force in 1952 as an aviation cadet. I flew\r\n  F-84s on 100 combat missions during the Korean war. After a tour as\r\n  a flight instructor I was assigned to the Aero Medical Laboratory\r\n  at Wright Patterson. I participated in both the Air Force Man in\r\n  Space program and Project Mercury. I also participated in the X-15\r\n  and X-20 programs and worked as a bioastronautics officer with NASA\r\n  on Gemini. During my Air Force career, I earned both a Master’s and\r\n  Doctorate degree from Purdue University. I flew a combat tour in\r\n  Southeast Asia in F-4s as a member of the 555th Tactical Fighter\r\n  Squadron and flew 133 combat missions. I retired from the Air Force\r\n  in 1978 as the Commander of the Human Resources Laboratory at\r\n  Brooks AFB, TX. I am presently the Director Of Biosciences for a\r\n  research organization in San Antonio, TX.\r\n\r\n  In 1959 I volunteered for training to become a back up pilot for\r\n  Capt Joe Kittenger in his high altitude balloon projects. I flew\r\n  two missions for training purposes with Capt Kittenger and Capt\r\n  Bill Kaufman from Holloman AFB, NM in May, 1959. On the second\r\n  flight we were practicing touch and go landings north of Roswell,\r\n  NM when we “crashed” on one of the landings. The gondola flipped\r\n  over and my head was pinned to the ground by the lip of the\r\n  gondola. We managed to lift the gondola off of my head and looked\r\n  it over for damage. Capt Kittenger was bleeding from a cut on his\r\n  face and I noticed that my head seemed to be protruding outward\r\n  from underneath my helmet. Realizing I was injured, I sat down and\r\n  feared I might go into shock. I was not in pain but my entire head\r\n  was throbbing and began to swell.\r\n\r\n  I then remember boarding the “chase” helicopter that was following\r\n  us and flying a short distance to Walker AFB for medical treatment.\r\n  I recall walking into the hospital and also stopping on the\r\n  front step to smoke a cigarette. I remember security personnel\r\n  escorting and questioning us to determine who we were. Security\r\n  was very tight at Strategic Air Command bases such as Walker. On\r\n  occasion surprise inspection teams from SAC headquarters arrived\r\n  in helicopters just as we did. In addition, a story of three Air\r\n  Force officers crashing in a balloon was somewhat far fetched. The\r\n  security people were convinced of our identities when they spoke\r\n  with Col John P. Stapp, the Aero Medical Laboratory Commander.\r\n\r\n  While I was at Walker my head had swelled considerably and both\r\n  eyes were turning black. Later the skin on my face turned yellow.\r\n  I remember being seen by one doctor and I do not believe any other\r\n  doctors participated in my treatment. I do not recall any nurses\r\n  attending to me. I also do not recall that a black NCO was present\r\n  nor do I recall any civilian men in the hospital. I do not recall\r\n  that Capt Kittenger was involved in an altercation of any kind\r\n  while we were there. After I was treated and released we all flew\r\n  back to Holloman on the helicopter.\r\n\r\n  At Holloman I was admitted to the hospital and had blood aspirated\r\n  from under my scalp. I remember my forehead drooping down, I had\r\n  to use my fingers to open my eyelids, and I had to sleep sitting\r\n  up. Several days later I returned to Wright Patterson with Capt\r\n  Kittenger and Capt Kaufman. My wife met the airplane and when she\r\n  saw me, she burst into tears due to the swelling of my head, the\r\n  two black eyes, and the yellow color of my skin. When I returned to\r\n  my office at Wright Patterson, my secretary also began to cry when\r\n  she saw me. After some weeks my head returned to normal size and I\r\n  was returned to flying status.\r\n\r\n  During my Air Force career I was involved in many different\r\n  scientific research projects including the space program. I can\r\n  state with certainty that none of them, including the incident\r\n  described here, had anything to do with UFOs or “space aliens”.\r\n\r\n  I am not part of any conspiracy to withhold or provide misleading\r\n  information to the United States Government or the American public.\r\n  There is no classified information that I am withholding related to\r\n  this inquiry and I have never been threatened by U.S. Government\r\n  persons concerning refraining from talking about this matter.\r\n\r\n  SIGNED:                       Subscribed and sworn before me, an\r\n                                individual authorized to administer\r\n                                oaths, this 25th day of May, 1995,\r\n                                at\r\n\r\n  [Signature]                     [Signature]\r\n  Dan D.

Gildenberg, GS-14, (Ret), hereby state that James\r\n  McAndrew was identified as a Lieutenant, USAFR on this date at my\r\n  home and do hereby, voluntarily and of my own free will, make the\r\n  following statement. This was done without having been subjected to\r\n  any coercion, unlawful influence or unlawful inducement.\r\n\r\n  I became involved in high altitude balloon development while an\r\n  undergraduate student at New York University (NYU). Following\r\n  graduation I was hired by the Air Force at Holloman AFB and worked\r\n  continuously as both a meteorologist and aerospace engineer at\r\n  the Balloon Branch from 1951 until my retirement in 1981. My job\r\n  responsibilities were to forecast the weather and fly by remote\r\n  control, high altitude balloons for many different scientific\r\n  projects. During this time. I became internationally recognized as\r\n  an authority on high altitude balloon trajectory forecasting. I\r\n  have published numerous technical reports and articles.\r\n\r\n  The first project in which I was involved, while still an\r\n  undergraduate student at NYU, was the acoustical detection of\r\n  nuclear explosions. The name of the project, Mogul, was classified\r\n  and I didn’t know this name until several years ago. Based on\r\n  my experience with this project I am certain project Mogul was\r\n  responsible for some portions of what has become to be known as the\r\n  “Roswell Incident”.\r\n\r\n  Following project Mogul I was involved in perfecting high\r\n  altitude balloon technology and made many test flights with large\r\n  polyethylene balloons from Holloman AFB. I worked extensively on\r\n  atmospheric sampling projects and biological flights in which\r\n  the balloons lifted small animals to altitude for cosmic ray\r\n  experiments. I also worked on the Moby Dick Project that collected\r\n  meteorological data and the classified Gopher (119L) reconnaissance\r\n  project.\r\n\r\n  I was relied upon to forecast the weather, conduct climatological\r\n  studies, predict balloon trajectories, and to hit with precision,\r\n  ground targets both on and off the White Sands Missile Range.\r\n  Balloon trajectories in New Mexico below the tropopause, are\r\n  predominantly towards the east-northeast, when launched from\r\n  Holloman AFB with the exception of July and August when balloons\r\n  remained over the Holloman area. At high altitude, above the\r\n  tropopause, trajectories are generally westerly during the summer\r\n  and easterly during the spring, fall, and winter. As a result\r\n  these winds, the Holloman balloon branch recovered many, probably\r\n  hundreds, of balloons and scientific payloads from the Roswell, NM\r\n  area over the years.\r\n\r\n  During the time of the year when trajectories were to the east I\r\n  attempted to drop the equipment near accessible non mountainous\r\n  areas and paved roads. The main target area was the first large\r\n  north-south road on the other side of the Sacramento Mountains\r\n  from Holloman AFB, Highway 285. This road goes north and south\r\n  through Roswell. The standard procedure was to preposition military\r\n  recovery crews near the projected point of payload impact. The\r\n  crews consisted primarily of Air Force members in uniform and\r\n  they operated military vehicles. I often directed these crews to\r\n  “standby” along the shoulder of Highway 285, both north and south\r\n  of Roswell until the balloon was in position. The recovery crews\r\n  received detailed instructions from the tracking aircraft that led\r\n  them to the exact location of the payload. The recovery vehicle\r\n  included, depending on the mission, a crane, weapons carriers,\r\n  communications van, and occasionally tanker trucks to refuel the\r\n  aircraft that would sometimes land on nearby roads.\r\n\r\n  During the time of the year when balloon trajectories were to the\r\n  west, I attempted to drop the payloads in the Rio Grande Valley.\r\n  I also aimed for another valley, the flat area north of Truth or\r\n  Consequences that includes the Plains of San Augustin. In addition,\r\n  many remote balloon launch sites were located throughout the Rio\r\n  Grande Valley west of the White Sands Proving Grounds. Launch crews\r\n  were also mostly military and used much of the same equipment as\r\n  the recovery crews.\r\n\r\n  I had extensive involvement with Project 7218 that later became\r\n  Project 7222. This project studied the free-fall characteristics\r\n  of anthropomorphic dummies dropped from balloons from altitudes\r\n  up to 100,000 feet. The missions usually consisted of two dummies\r\n  attached to a suspension rack that I directed to be released at\r\n  altitude. Depending on the wind conditions and time of year, the\r\n  dummies, on many occasions, landed in the Roswell area. I recall\r\n  some difficulties in the release mechanisms of the dummies that\r\n  resulted in some of them free-falling to the ground while they were\r\n  still attached to the rack. Someone without a good vantage point\r\n  or not associated with the project might mistake these dummies for\r\n  “aliens” due to their odd flesh tones and abstract human features.\r\n\r\n  I also recall an accident involving a manned balloon flight. I\r\n  remember this event clearly because I am also a balloon pilot\r\n  and had an accident approximately two years before. The accident\r\n  occurred on a flight that Capt Joe Kittenger was “checking out”\r\n  two back up pilots for his high altitude missions. The balloon was\r\n  launched around midnight from behind the Balloon Branch at Holloman\r\n  AFB. I remember that some of the steel ballast used by the balloon\r\n  caused a “fireworks” display when it contacted some nearby power\r\n  lines during the launch. I was operating the control center for\r\n  this flight and I received notification from the communications\r\n  vehicle that was following the balloon that there had been an\r\n  accident north of Roswell. I later learned that the gondola had\r\n  rolled over during a practice touch and go landing and one of the\r\n  pilots had been struck in the head and injured. I recall speaking\r\n  to Capt Kittinger about the accident and I saw the injured pilot.\r\n  Although his injury was not serious, his head had considerable\r\n  swelling and he looked very odd.\r\n\r\n  I also worked with Capt Kittinger on Project Stargazer. I also had\r\n  met several times the civilian scientific advisor Dr. J. Allen\r\n  Hynek. Dr Hynek was thoroughly familiar with the balloon operations\r\n  at Holloman and visited the Balloon Branch numerous times. This\r\n  project experienced some difficulties and only one manned flight\r\n  was conducted.\r\n\r\n  Another project I was involved with was the Air Force\r\n  investigations of UFOs. Project Bluebook. Since I was a\r\n  meteorologist and amateur astronomer I evaluated, starting in 1951,\r\n  local sightings of UFOs. New Mexico had alot of sightings because\r\n  of the good visibility and the many experimental projects of the\r\n  White Sands Proving Grounds. During my time on Project Bluebook\r\n  there wasn’t any sightings that we could not explain. Nevertheless\r\n  popular literature still refers to some of these sightings as\r\n  unexplained.\r\n\r\n  Another project with which I was involved, was the NASA Voyager\r\n  and Viking Projects. These space vehicles were tested by launching\r\n  them from our balloons at extremely high altitude to simulate the\r\n  atmosphere of Venus and Mars. To utilize the instrumentation on\r\n  the White Sands Missile Range I elected to launch the balloons and\r\n  attached space vehicles from the Roswell Industrial Air Center,\r\n  formerly the Roswell Army Airfield. The Holloman Balloon Branch\r\n  made approximately eight launches of these two vehicles from\r\n  Roswell. In appearance the Viking and Voyager probes could be\r\n  mistaken for a flying saucer. They were both unclassified highly\r\n  publicized projects and I do not recall getting any UFO reports for\r\n  these flights. I believe one of these probes is on display at White\r\n  Sands Missile Range and its known as the “flying saucer”.\r\n\r\n  I am not part of any conspiracy to withhold or provide misleading\r\n  information to the United States Government or the American public.\r\n  There is no classified information that I am withholding related to\r\n  this inquiry and I have never been threatened by U.S. Government\r\n  persons concerning refraining from talking about this matter.\r\n\r\n  SIGNED:                       Subscribed and sworn before me, an\r\n                                individual authorized to administer\r\n                                oaths, this 25th day of May, 1995,\r\n                                at\r\n\r\n  [Signature]                         [Signature]\r\n  Bernard D.

USAF, (Ret), hereby state that James\r\n  McAndrew was identified as a Lieutenant, USAFR on this date at my\r\n  home and do hereby, voluntarily and of my own free will, make the\r\n  following statement. This was done without having been subjected to\r\n  any coercion, unlawful influence or unlawful inducement.\r\n\r\n  I enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 1957 and became a Ground\r\n  Communications and Electronic Repairman. I remained in this career\r\n  field throughout my career. I completed three tours at the Balloon\r\n  Branch at Holloman AFB, NM. I retired from the Air Force in 1977 as\r\n  the NCOIC of the Communication and Instrumentation Section of the\r\n  Balloon Branch at Holloman AFB.\r\n\r\n  I recall an overnight balloon training mission that was conducted\r\n  in May, 1959. Capt Joe Kittinger was training back up pilots\r\n  for one of his upcoming projects. I was an airman assigned to\r\n  coordinate communications and to assist in the recovery of the\r\n  balloon upon completion of the mission. I followed the balloon in\r\n  an old Korean War vintage “crackerbox” ambulance that had been\r\n  converted into a communications van. Another airman and I followed\r\n  the balloon throughout the night on an easterly trajectory over the\r\n  Sacramento Mountains to an area north of Roswell. Also following\r\n  the balloon were recovery technicians in a weapons carrier. We\r\n  stayed in contact with the balloon crew by radio and also observed\r\n  flares the crew would light at various intervals so we could\r\n  visually track them. Just after sunrise I recall the balloon\r\n  landing north of Roswell and Capt Kittinger offered me some coffee\r\n  and told me he was going to make one more touch and go landing to\r\n  complete the mission. I remember that I took some photographs of\r\n  the balloon and waited for the last landing. Several minutes later\r\n  I remember hearing a “bang”, this was the squib that fired to\r\n  release the gondola from the balloon. We immediately went to where\r\n  the gondola landed and saw the gondola laying on its side and saw\r\n  two of the pilots standing and one lying down. Lying on the ground\r\n  was a shattered helmet that was worn by one of the pilots. Capt\r\n  Kittinger told me they were attempting to land to avoid some power\r\n  lines and a row of trees.\r\n\r\n  Soon after I arrived at the crash site, a helicopter that was also\r\n  following the flight landed and transported the three aircrew\r\n  members to Walker AFB for medical attention. I recall I assisted\r\n  the recovery technicians load the balloon and the gondola on the\r\n  weapons carrier and then drove 15 to 20 minutes to the hospital\r\n  at Walker AFB. When I arrived at Walker, we parked the converted\r\n  ambulance near the hospital and either the other airman with me\r\n  or the recovery technicians called the balloon control center to\r\n  notify them of the accident. I recall waiting near the hospital\r\n  for a short period of time and then returning to Holloman AFB.\r\n  During the time I was waiting at the hospital I did not observe\r\n  any arguments or altercations. I did not observe Capt Kittinger\r\n  speaking disrespectfully to anyone. I also do not recall any male\r\n  civilians or any vehicles that belonged to a mortuary.\r\n\r\n  I participated in many, probably more than 100, balloon recoveries.\r\n  I often recovered payloads and balloons from the area surrounding\r\n  Roswell, NM. It was routine to be directed by the balloon control\r\n  center to an area near Roswell to wait to recover a balloon. We\r\n  would wait along the side of the road, at small airports, or at\r\n  the armory in Roswell. It would not be uncommon for our recovery\r\n  vehicles to be seen waiting to recover balloons throughout New\r\n  Mexico, Arizona, and West Texas. When we recovered the balloons\r\n  and payloads sometimes civilians would be in the area and make\r\n  inquires. We would tell them what we were doing and provide them\r\n  with a telephone number at Holloman AFB if they wanted to report\r\n  any damages. We were required to clean up the area and remove all\r\n  debris before we left. In addition to the recoveries, I recall\r\n  making balloon launches from sites up and down the Rio Grande\r\n  Valley. I remember that some of these launches were made from an\r\n  area west of Soccoro, NM.\r\n\r\n  Another project I participated in was the testing of the Viking\r\n  space probe in 1972. These four launches were all made from the\r\n  Roswell Industrial Air Center, the former Roswell Army Airfield.\r\n  Approximately twenty Air Force personnel were on temporary duty to\r\n  Roswell throughout the summer of 1972 to support this project. NASA\r\n  personnel prepared the spacecraft for launch from the old hangers\r\n  of the former Air Force base. This project was not classified and\r\n  was covered by the news media.\r\n\r\n  I am not part of any conspiracy to withhold or provide misleading\r\n  information to the United States Government or the American public.\r\n  There is no classified information that I am withholding related to\r\n  this inquiry and I have never been threatened by U.S. Government\r\n  persons concerning refraining from talking about this matter.\r\n\r\n  SIGNED:                       Subscribed and sworn before me, an\r\n                                individual authorized to administer\r\n                                oaths, this 25th day of May, 1995,\r\n                                at\r\n\r\n  [Signature]                        [Signature]\r\n  Ole Jorgesen, MSgt, USAF, (Ret)    James McAndrew, 1st Lt, USAFR\r\n\r\n  WITNESS(s):\r\n\r\n\r\n                         STATEMENT OF WITNESS\r\n\r\n  Place                                      Date: 28 October 1996\r\n\r\n  I, William C. Kaufman, Lt. Col., USAF (Ret), hereby voluntarily and\r\n  of my own free will, make the following statement. This was done\r\n  without coercion, unlawful influence or unlawful inducement.\r\n\r\n  I was drafted into the Army of the United States in 1943,\r\n  transferred to the Army Air Forces, and was commissioned as a pilot\r\n  in 1944. From 1950 until 1967, with a break for training for a\r\n  combat tour in Korea and for educational assignments to AFIT, I was\r\n  assigned to the Aero Medical Laboratory at Wright Patterson AFB,\r\n  OH. During that time I was a physiological training officer and\r\n  worked in the development of early pressure suits. I tested many\r\n  high altitude pilots and also the first group of astronauts. Later\r\n  during my Air Force career, in 1961, I earned a Ph.D. in Physiology\r\n  and Biophysics. I was assigned to the Aero Medical Laboratory for\r\n  three tours and retired in 1968 as the Chief of the Biodynamics\r\n  Branch of the Aero Medical Field Laboratory at Holloman AFB, NM.\r\n\r\n  During my third assignment at Wright Patterson, I volunteered,\r\n  along with Capt Dan Fulgham, to be a backup pilot for Capt Joe\r\n  Kittinger for his high altitude balloon project, Project Excelsior.\r\n  Capt Kittinger instructed Capt Fulgham and me in ballooning in May\r\n  1959. At the end of an overnight training flight, on the morning\r\n  of May 21, 1959, northwest of Roswell, NM, we (Kittinger, Fulgham\r\n  and I) had an accident with the balloon. We were practicing touch\r\n  and go landings when a severe gust of wind overturned the gondola,\r\n  dumping all of us to the ground with the gondola on top of us.\r\n  The accident occurred in a small pasture where a pony was grazing\r\n  next to a small cottage. For safety, we were followed during hours\r\n  of darkness by a C-131 aircraft and during the day by a H-21\r\n  helicopter. We were followed the entire time by technicians in a\r\n  truck for communications and for the recovery of the balloon and\r\n  gondola. Seeing the accident, the crews of the helicopter and the\r\n  recovery trucks came to our assistance, much to the dismay of the\r\n  farmer who owned the pony, which had run away when the truck broke\r\n  down the fence to reach the crash site. I recall that a member of\r\n  the helicopter crew attempted to calm the farmer.\r\n\r\n  Capt Fulgham sustained an injury to the forehead when the lip of\r\n  the gondola struck him. Capt Fulgham thought he had fractured\r\n  his skull but the experimental helmet he was wearing apparently\r\n  protected him. Capt Kittinger was bleeding from a cut on the face.\r\n  I was beneath Fulgham and Kittinger and unhurt. Fulgham was loaded\r\n  into the helicopter and we were taken to the nearest hospital,\r\n  at Walker AFB, in Roswell. I recall the helicopter pilot called\r\n  the air traffic control tower at Walker and informed them we were\r\n  inbound with an injured pilot from a balloon accident. This was\r\n  quite unusual and I believe the tower personnel might have thought\r\n  we were a surprise Strategic Air Command inspection team that at\r\n  the direction of the SAC Commander, Gen. Curtis E. LeMay, sometimes\r\n  made unannounced visits by helicopter. We landed in front of the\r\n  tower and were met by an ambulance along with a detail of military\r\n  police with machine guns. The military police escorted us to the\r\n  hospital for treatment and to verify our story of the balloon crash.\r\n\r\n  While Capt Fulgham and Capt Kittinger were being treated I was\r\n  asked to explain to the Walker AFB Base Commander what had\r\n  happened. After Capt Kittinger was treated he called Col Stapp from\r\n  a phone adjacent to the waiting room were numerous military wives\r\n  were waiting for pre-natal care. Capt Kittinger, as the project\r\n  officer, was concerned what effect this accident might have on the\r\n  future of his program. As we waited for Fulgham, Kittinger paced up\r\n  and down the hall concerned about Fulgham and getting out of the\r\n  hospital before Walker AFB officials might complicate matters. I\r\n  do not recall any male civilians in the hospital, nor do I recall\r\n  Capt Kittinger being involved in an altercation of any kind. Capt\r\n  Kittinger did not shout or use obscene language, he was simply\r\n  interested in getting medical attention for Fulgham and leaving as\r\n  soon as possible. I do recall that one or two nurses were present.\r\n  I do not recall a black NCO accompanying Kittinger while we were in\r\n  the hospital.\r\n\r\n  When the medical personnel were finished treating Fulgham, all\r\n  three of us returned to Holloman AFB by helicopter about noon the\r\n  same day. The following day I took my FAA exam and was awarded a\r\n  balloon pilot license. Three days later, on Sunday, Kittinger,\r\n  Fulgham and I returned to Wright Patterson via a special C-131\r\n  flight. Fulgham looked very odd with two black eyes and protruding\r\n  forehead; his head was so swollen he could not wear his uniform hat\r\n  for some time. I later worked with Capt Kittinger on the Stargazer\r\n  project and and occasionally flew aircraft with him.\r\n\r\n  During my entire time at the Aero Medical Laboratory I neither\r\n  saw nor heard anything that would lead me to believe that the Air\r\n  Force was keeping “aliens” at Wright Patterson. I knew there was a\r\n  project on UFOs called Bluebook, at the base, but to my knowledge\r\n  the Aero Medical Laboratory was not involved. Many scientific\r\n  accomplishments came out of the various laboratories at Wright\r\n  Patterson but I am unaware of any that might have involved aliens\r\n  or UFOs.\r\n\r\n  I am not part of any conspiracy to withhold or provide misleading\r\n  information to the United States Government or the American public.\r\n  There is no classified information that I am withholding related to\r\n  this inquiry and I have never been threatened by U.S. Government\r\n  persons concerning refraining from talking about this matter.\r\n\r\n  This is as I recollect those events.\r\n\r\n  SIGNED:\r\n\r\n  [Signature]\r\n  William C. Kaufman, LtCol. USAFC (Ret)\r\n\r\n  WITNESS(s):\r\n  [Signature: Patricia A. Kaufman]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         STATEMENT OF WITNESS\r\n\r\n  Place                                             Date: 24 June 95\r\n\r\n  I, Joseph W. Kittinger. Jr., Col. USAF (Ret), hereby state that\r\n  James McAndrew was identified as a Lieutenant, USAFR on this\r\n  date at my home and do hereby, voluntarily and of my own free\r\n  will, make the following statement. This was done without having\r\n  been subjected to any coercion, unlawful influence or unlawful\r\n  inducement.\r\n\r\n  I entered the U.S. Air Force in 1949 as an Aviation Cadet. From\r\n  1950 to 1953 I flew fighters in Europe before being assigned to the\r\n  Fighter Test Section at Holloman AFB, NM in July, 1953. During my\r\n  tour as a test pilot I conducted the first zero gravity tests and\r\n  was the balloon pilot of the first Project Man High high altitude\r\n  research mission. In 1958 I was assigned to the Escape Section of\r\n  the Aero Medical laboratory at Wright Patterson AFB, OH. During\r\n  this tour I was the Project Officer of Project Excelsior and made\r\n  three high altitude parachute jumps, the highest from 102,800 feet,\r\n  which today remains a world record. For these jumps I was awarded\r\n  the Hannon Trophy for 1960 by President Eisenhower. Following\r\n  Excelsior, I was the Project Officer of Stargazer, a project that\r\n  made astronomical observations from a high altitude balloon. I\r\n  flew two combat tours in Southeast Asia with the Air Commandos. I\r\n  later flew a tour in F-4s and was the Squadron Commander of the 555\r\n  Tactical Fighter Squadron. I accumulated over 1,000 combat flying\r\n  hours and I am credited with one aerial victory. I spent ten months\r\n  as a POW in Hanoi. Upon my return I attended Air War College, flew\r\n  F-4s and retired from the Air Force in 1978. In 1984 I became the\r\n  first person to make a solo crossing of the Atlantic by balloon.\r\n\r\n  In 1958 I was made the Project Officer of Excelsior by Col John\r\n  Paul Stapp, the Aero Medical Laboratory Commander. I supervised\r\n  and was actively involved in the dropping and recovery of\r\n  anthropomorphic dummies from high altitude balloons at Holloman\r\n  AFB, NM for this project. We also dropped dummies, from aircraft\r\n  only, at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH. The object of the Holloman tests\r\n  were to study the free fall characteristics of dummies dropped from\r\n  balloons at altitudes of 50,000 to 100,000 feet. Based on this data\r\n  we designed a parachute that stabilized the dummies and I later\r\n  used this parachute on my three high altitude jumps.\r\n\r\n  The balloons carrying the dummies were launched from various\r\n  locations in New Mexico and often impacted off of the White Sands\r\n  Proving Ground depending on the wind conditions. The dummies were\r\n  outfitted with clothing and equipment of an Air Force pilot. The\r\n  facial features of the dummies were not as pronounced as a human.\r\n  The ears and noses did not protrude. I do not recall any dummies\r\n  with ears or noses. Some of the dummies were not complete; they\r\n  sometimes did not have arms or legs. To someone not associated with\r\n  the project or who viewed the dummies from a distance, they could\r\n  appear to be human or with some imagination a space “alien.” In\r\n  fact, I recall one incident at Wright-Patterson where one of our\r\n  dummies landed near the backyard of Gen. Rawlings, Commander of\r\n  the Air Research and Development Command. Gen. Rawling’s wife was\r\n  entertaining officer’s wives that afternoon when one of our dummy’s\r\n  parachute failed to deploy and impacted the ground in full view of\r\n  the ladies at Gen. Rawling’s home. I acted quickly to retrieve the\r\n  dummy and went to the impact site and recovered it by throwing it\r\n  in the back of a pickup truck and quickly driving away. Later that\r\n  day I received a call from Col Stapp who informed me that some of\r\n  the women at the party believed that the dummy was a human and they\r\n  were appalled to see the careless nature in which the obviously\r\n  dead or injured “parachutist” was hauled away.\r\n\r\n  At Holloman AFB recoveries of the dummies were handled by the\r\n  Balloon Branch but members of my project team, including myself,\r\n  often assisted. The standard procedure was to track the dummy\r\n  both from the ground and air to attempt to recover the dummies\r\n  in a timely manner. On the ground we used an assortment of Air\r\n  Force vehicles to track and recover not only the dummies but also\r\n  other scientific balloon payloads. We used trucks, communications\r\n  vans, converted field ambulances, cranes, and trailers. In the\r\n  air we used helicopters, C-47s transports, and L-19 and L-20\r\n  light observation aircraft. On occasion civilians would observe\r\n  our recovery operations. We often attracted a crowd due to the\r\n  odd appearance of the balloon payloads and dummies and also the\r\n  aircraft that circled overhead or landed on nearby roads. We also\r\n  used many of the same procedures and equipment to launch from off\r\n  range locations. During the recoveries weapons were not carried\r\n  because there was no classified information or equipment. I do not\r\n  recall any altercations of any kind. At no time did I or any of the\r\n  personnel makes threats against civilians. We always attempted to\r\n  maintain good relations with the local civilians and explained the\r\n  purpose of the project to them if they asked. We were directed to\r\n  remove as much of the material dropped by the balloon as possible.\r\n  Sometimes this was difficult because the balloon and pay load would\r\n  break apart and cover a large area. We collected the debris in\r\n  these cases by “fanning out” across a field until we had collected\r\n  even very small portions of the payload and balloon. We were\r\n  particularly careful to recover the large plastic balloons because\r\n  cattle would ingest the material and the ranchers would file claims\r\n  against the government. Additionally, there were reward notices\r\n  that offered twenty five dollars for the return of the equipment\r\n  attached to each of the balloons. I wrote a book, _The Long, Lonely\r\n  Leap_ (E. P. Dutton & Co., 1961), that completely describes Project\r\n  Excelsior and my participation.\r\n\r\n  Also as a part of the high altitude balloon projects, I trained\r\n  balloon pilots in May 1959 at the request of Col Stapp. Col Stapp\r\n  was concerned that I might be injured as a result of the hazardous\r\n  nature of the projects and he wanted backup pilots to be trained.\r\n  The backup pilots, Capt Dan Fulgham and Capt Bill Kaufman were\r\n  volunteers from the Aero Medical Laboratory and they were sent to\r\n  Holloman from Wright-Patterson for training on a temporary duty\r\n  basis. On our second training flight, Fulgham, Kaufman and I, flew\r\n  an overnight mission that was launched at Holloman and ended with\r\n  a crash northwest of Roswell, NM. We were followed on this mission\r\n  by an aircraft at night, a helicopter during the day, and a ground\r\n  crew in trucks at all times.\r\n\r\n  I recall that just after sunrise the weather had deteriorated and I\r\n  directed Fulgham to land the balloon in a small field. This was the\r\n  last suitable field before we would overfly the City of Roswell. I\r\n  remember approaching the field just over the trees and I recall our\r\n  forward velocity was about 10–12 knots, a little fast for landing.\r\n  When we touched down Fulgham cut the balloon away and due to the\r\n  forward velocity the gondola flipped over spilling all three of us\r\n  on the ground. While lying on the ground I realized that Fulgham\r\n  was injured and Kaufman and I raised the gondola. Fulgham had been\r\n  struck in the head by the edge of the gondola and I could see the\r\n  blood rapidly accumulating under his scalp in the forehead area. We\r\n  treated him for shock and soon the recovery vehicles and the chase\r\n  helicopter arrived. I decided to transport Fulgham by helicopter to\r\n  the hospital at nearby Walker AFB.\r\n\r\n  When we arrived at Walker I remember that security was tight, as\r\n  it was at all Strategic Air Command bases, and we were closely\r\n  scrutinized by security personnel due to the unusual circumstances\r\n  and early hour of our arrival. I had two concerns once we arrived\r\n  at the hospital, first to get treatment for Fulgham and second\r\n  to leave as soon as possible. After I was assured that Fulgham’s\r\n  injuries were not serious I wanted to quickly leave the base before\r\n  the Walker AFB Flying Safety Officer arrived to fill out an\r\n  accident report. I didn’t want a report filed because an accident\r\n  investigation would bring unwanted scrutiny to the project. Even\r\n  though the project was unclassified I did not want any publicity or\r\n  premature releases of information.\r\n\r\n  Although Fulgham’s injuries were not serious, his head had swollen\r\n  considerably—both eyes were black and his face had swollen so\r\n  much you could barely see his nose. I believe that if someone saw\r\n  him while we were at Walker they would have been startled. When\r\n  his treatment was completed we all three returned to Holloman on\r\n  the helicopter. At Holloman, Fulgham was admitted to the hospital\r\n  and I made preparations for him to return to his duty station at\r\n  Wright-Patterson AFB. Due to his grotesque appearance, I did not\r\n  want Fulgham to fly on a commercial airline. I made arrangements\r\n  for all of us to fly to Wright-Patterson on a C-131 a few days\r\n  later. When we arrived at Wright-Patterson, I assisted Fulgham down\r\n  the steps of the aircraft because his eyes were swollen shut and\r\n  he could not see. His wife was waiting at the bottom of the steps\r\n  of the aircraft and she asked me where her husband was. I replied\r\n  “this is your husband” and she screamed and began to cry.\r\n\r\n  While I was at the Walker AFB hospital, I do not recall any contact\r\n  with a male civilian. I certainly did not call anyone an “SOB”\r\n  or speak to anyone in a disrespectful manner. I did not make any\r\n  threats or instruct anyone else to make threats. I recall nurses\r\n  in the hospital but I am not certain if they participated in the\r\n  treatment of Capt Fulgham. I was not accompanied by a black NCO at\r\n  the hospital, but there may have been a black NCO on the balloon\r\n  recovery team. I recall no body bags in the hospital and I am sure\r\n  there were no “aliens” at the hospital, just Dan Fulgham with a\r\n  very odd looking head injury.\r\n\r\n  I was also involved in the joint Air Force, Navy, and Massachusetts\r\n  Institute of Technology astronomical observation project, Project\r\n  Stargazer. The object of this project was to make observations via\r\n  a stabilized telescope mounted atop of a gondola suspended from\r\n  a high altitude balloon. I was the USAF project officer and Dr\r\n  J. Allen Hynek was the scientific advisor. I worked very closely\r\n  with Dr Hynek over a period of five years from 1958 to 1963. Dr\r\n  Hynek would typically spend a half day working on Stargazer and\r\n  then the rest of the day participating as one of the consultants\r\n  on the UFO study, Project Bluebook, that was also conducted at\r\n  Wright-Patterson AFB. Dr Hynek, as the scientific advisor to\r\n  Stargazer, was very familiar with the techniques and capabilities\r\n  of the Air Force high altitude balloon program. Dr Hynek once\r\n  approached me and we discussed at length, the possibility that\r\n  Air Force high altitude balloons were responsible for many UFO\r\n  sightings. We ended the conversation in agreement that the\r\n  balloons probably accounted for many of the UFO sightings. In\r\n  other conversations Dr Hynek always gave me the impression that\r\n  there were very few UFO sightings that could not be explained by\r\n  good scientific investigation. At no time did Dr Hynek mention\r\n  or discuss the alleged “Roswell Incident”. I was therefore\r\n  “flabbergasted” when Dr Hynek appeared to believe that some of\r\n  these sightings were of an extraterrestrial origin.\r\n\r\n  I am not part of any conspiracy to withhold or provide misleading\r\n  information to the United States Government or the American public.\r\n  There is no classified information that I am withholding related to\r\n  this inquiry and I have never been threatened by U.S. Government\r\n  persons concerning refraining from talking about this matter.\r\n\r\n  SIGNED:                       Sworn to and subscribed before me,\r\n                                an individual authorized to administer\r\n                                oaths, this 25th day of May, 1995,\r\n                                at\r\n\r\n  [Signature]                                  [Signature]\r\n  Joseph W.

Lutz, CMSgt, USAF, (Ret), hereby state that James\r\n  McAndrew was identified as a Lieutenant, USAFR on this date at my\r\n  home and do hereby, voluntarily and of my own free will, make the\r\n  following statement. This was done without having been subjected to\r\n  any coercion, unlawful influence or unlawful inducement.\r\n\r\n  I enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1947 and transferred to the U.S. Air\r\n  Force in 1958. In June, 1958 I was assigned to the flight surgeon’s\r\n  office at Holloman AFB, NM as an Aero Medical Technician. I served\r\n  several tours in Southeast Asia and retired from the Air Force in\r\n  1974 as an Aero Medical Superintendent.\r\n\r\n  On May 20–21, 1959 I was assigned to provide medical coverage for a\r\n  balloon training mission that took off from Holloman AFB and ended\r\n  with a crash near Roswell, NM. Capt Joe Kittinger was training\r\n  two other pilots, Capt Fulgham and Capt Kaufman. I followed the\r\n  balloon in an ambulance during the night and at daybreak I followed\r\n  the balloon in an H-21 helicopter. Just after daybreak I saw the\r\n  balloon crash and the three pilots were dumped form the gondola.\r\n  I immediately informed the helicopter pilot and we landed in a\r\n  field on which cattle were grazing. I recall the rancher was upset\r\n  because the helicopter was frightening his cattle and some cattle\r\n  had gotten out of the field.\r\n\r\n  I assesed the injuries to the pilots and recommended they be taken\r\n  immediately to the closest hospital which was at Walker AFB,\r\n  apprximately 5 to 10 minutes away by helicopter. Capt Fulgham’s\r\n  head was swelling due to a hemotoma he received when the gondola\r\n  struck him. Capt Kittinger was cut on the face and was bleeding.\r\n  Capt Kaufman was uninjured. At Walker I remember a telephone\r\n  conversation with a flight surgeon who told me to “go home and\r\n  sleep it off”. He apparently did not believe my story of three\r\n  Air Force pilots that were victims of a balloon crash. However,\r\n  I was able to convince him and he treated Capt Fulgham and Capt\r\n  Kittinger. While at the hospital Capt Fulgham’s head had swelled\r\n  enormously and his eyes were beginning to turn black.\r\n\r\n  I do not recall that anything unusual occurred at the hospital\r\n  at Walker. I remember the three pilots sitting on a bench in\r\n  the hallway waiting to be treated. I do not remember that Capt\r\n  Kittinger was involved in an altercation with anyone while at the\r\n  hospital, if he had, I would have known about it. Capt Kittinger\r\n  was concerned with getting medical treatment for his injured crew\r\n  member, Capt Fulgham, and returning to Holloman. I also do not\r\n  recall a black NCO accompanying Capt Kittinger while we were at\r\n  the hospital. I do not remember a nurse assisting in the treatment\r\n  of Capt Fulgham or Capt Kittinger. I also do not remember a male\r\n  civilian or any personnel or vehicles from a mortuary, and I do not\r\n  recall any remains in body bags in the hospital.\r\n\r\n  I was present the entire time when the events described here took\r\n  place. I am certain that this event had nothing to do with “space\r\n  aliens” or any other irregular activity that would require a cover\r\n  up. It was a balloon crash and nothing else.\r\n\r\n  I am not part of any conspiracy to withhold or provide misleading\r\n  information to the United States Government or the American public.\r\n  There is no classified information that I am withholding related to\r\n  this inquiry and I have never been threatened by U.S. Government\r\n  persons concerning refraining from talking about this matter.\r\n\r\n  SIGNED:                       Subscribed and sworn before me, an\r\n                                individual authorized to administer\r\n                                oaths, this 25th day of May, 1995,\r\n                                at\r\n\r\n  [Signature]                   [Signature]\r\n  Roland H.

Madson, Lt Col, USAF (Ret), hereby state that James\r\n  McAndrew was identified as a Lieutenant, USAFR on this date at my\r\n  place of employment and do hereby, voluntarily and of my own free\r\n  will, make the following statement. This was done without having\r\n  been subjected to any coercion, unlawful influence or unlawful\r\n  inducement.\r\n\r\n  I was born, raised, and presently reside in New Mexico. I graduated\r\n  from New Mexico A&M College in 1954. I entered the Air Force in\r\n  1955 and was assigned a short time later to the Aero Medical\r\n  Laboratory at Wright Patterson AFB, OH. At the Aero Medical\r\n  Laboratory I was assigned to the Escape Section as a project\r\n  officer and test parachutist. During this time I also had extensive\r\n  participation in various aspects of the space program and worked\r\n  on the highly classified U-2 project. I served a tour of duty in\r\n  Alaska and at the School of Aerospace Medicine at Brooks AFB,\r\n  TX, before being reassigned to the Aero Medical Laboratory at\r\n  Wright Patterson. I retired in from the Air Force in 1979 and I am\r\n  currently and Environmental Specialist for the State of New Mexico.\r\n\r\n  The first project that I was assigned at Wright Patterson was\r\n  Project 7218, later changed to Project 7222. This project was first\r\n  known by the name High Dive and then was known as Excelsior. The\r\n  object of this project was to study the free fall characteristics\r\n  of anthropomorphic dummies from balloons at altitudes of 50,000\r\n  to 100,000 feet. Following satisfactory dummy drops, Capt Joe\r\n  Kittinger made a series of high altitude parachute jumps that\r\n  culminated with a jump from 102,800 feet.\r\n\r\n  I assumed the duties of Project Officer for the dummy drops in the\r\n  spring of 1956. I made numerous trips to Holloman AFB, NM, the\r\n  site of the drops, from 1956 until the end of the project in 1959\r\n  (dummies were also dropped for this project at Wright Patterson\r\n  AFB by personnel from the Parachute Branch). I wrote two technical\r\n  reports that described the project in considerable detail. The\r\n  type of anthropomorphic dummy used primarily was manufactured by\r\n  Alderson Laboratories but we also used Sierra Manufacturing type\r\n  dummies. Both of these dummies are shown in the technical reports.\r\n  The Alderson dummy had facial features that were not life-like\r\n  and ears that were not well defined. The dummies were outfitted\r\n  with flight suits of various colors, fuchsia, olive drab, and sage\r\n  green (a shade of gray). We chose the Alderson dummy because it was\r\n  relatively inexpensive as compared to the Sierra dummy.\r\n\r\n  We encountered considerable difficulty dropping the dummies from\r\n  the balloons. I designed the rack that suspended the dummies, two\r\n  at a time, from the balloon. On numerous occasions the dummies were\r\n  fouled during the release sequence and the dummy rode a “streamer”\r\n  all the way to the ground. Other times malfunctions occurred that\r\n  caused the two dummies and the entire rack assembly to descend to\r\n  the ground as one package. Both of these instances are described in\r\n  the technical reports.\r\n\r\n  I participated in at least two dummy recoveries. The meteorologist\r\n  from the Balloon Branch, Duke Gildenberg, would determine the best\r\n  place to launch the balloons depending on the prevailing weather\r\n  conditions. Duke also predicted, with considerable accuracy,\r\n  where the dummies would impact. I specifically recall a dummy I\r\n  recovered near the Jornada test range, between Leasburg and Organ,\r\n  NM. During this recovery I drove a weapons carrier and I was only\r\n  able to locate one of the dummies. I never found out what happened\r\n  to the other one. The next recovery I remember was on a ranch just\r\n  southwest of Roswell. We were given directions to the area by the\r\n  balloon branch personnel who had been contacted by a rancher. The\r\n  equipment had reward notices taped to them to aid in recovery. We\r\n  went to the Smith ranch. I remember the name because I went to New\r\n  Mexico A&M with the rancher. I knew him as Smitty. We searched that\r\n  day from horseback and could not find the dummies. The following\r\n  day we resumed our search from horseback and again could not\r\n  find the dummies. I also recall that Smitty asked us for some of\r\n  the parachute material so he could make a shirt. We dropped many\r\n  dummies from the balloons and I know many were not immediately\r\n  recovered, but most were.\r\n\r\n  I served for twenty five years in the Air Force and most of those\r\n  years were in the aero medical field. I participated in the space\r\n  program and the highly classified early stages of U-2 program.\r\n  Never during this time were “aliens” or “flying saucers” a part of\r\n  any project. There were, however, countless achievements by the\r\n  Air Force in aerospace medicine that were the result of dedicated\r\n  scientific research. It seems likely to me that someone could have\r\n  mistaken our anthropomorphic dummies for something that they were\r\n  not.\r\n\r\n  I am not part of any conspiracy to withhold or provide misleading\r\n  information to the United States Government or the American public.\r\n  There is no classified information that I am withholding related to\r\n  this inquiry and I have never been threatened by U.S. Government\r\n  persons concerning refraining from talking about this matter.\r\n\r\n  SIGNED:                       Sworn to and subscribed before me,\r\n                                an individual authorized to administer\r\n                                oaths, this 25th day of May, 1995,\r\n                                at\r\n\r\n  [Signature]                   [Signature]\r\n  Raymond A.

Nordstrom, M. D., hereby state that James McAndrew,\r\n  was identified as a Captain, USAFR on this date at my home and do\r\n  hereby, voluntarily and of my own free will, make the following\r\n  statement. This was done without having been subjected to any\r\n  coercion, unlawful influence or unlawful inducement.\r\n\r\n  I was on active duty in the US Air Force and stationed at Walker\r\n  AFB, Roswell, NM from July 1951 until June 1953. During that time I\r\n  was a pediatrician assigned to the base hospital. Following my tour\r\n  of duty with the Air Force I attended the University of Colorado as\r\n  a resident in pediatrics. In July 1954 I relocated to Farmington,\r\n  NM and began a private pediatric practice. I retired from private\r\n  practice in 1987 and became the Medical Director of the San Juan\r\n  Regional Medical Center, which is also located in Farmington, NM.\r\n  In 1989 I retired from that position and presently reside in Aztec,\r\n  NM.\r\n\r\n  I have been shown two transcripts of interviews where an individual\r\n  named Glenn Dennis described conversations and visits he claims\r\n  he had with a pediatrician in the late 1940s or early 1950s in\r\n  Farmington, NM. According to these interviews, Mr Dennis also\r\n  claims that this pediatrician had previously served at the hospital\r\n  at Walker AFB/Roswell AAF. Since I am the only physician in\r\n  Farmington, NM who previously served at the Walker AFB/Roswell\r\n  AAF hospital, I believe I am the person he is referring to in\r\n  these interviews. I am confident of this because I know I was the\r\n  first pediatrician to practice in Farmington, which when I arrived\r\n  in 1954, was a small community of approximately 8,000 people. I\r\n  remained the sole pediatrician there for approximately 20 years and\r\n  I know most, if not all, of the physicians in the area.\r\n\r\n  Even though I believe I am the person Mr Dennis referred to in the\r\n  interviews, I do not remember him. I can state with reasonable\r\n  certainty that I cannot recall any conversations with him, and he,\r\n  to my knowledge, never visited me in Farmington, NM, in Colorado,\r\n  or anyplace else. I have been told, however, that a person named\r\n  Glenn Dennis operated a drugstore in the late 1950s-early 1960s,\r\n  just outside Farmington, in Aztec, NM. But I do not recall any\r\n  contact with him there either.\r\n\r\n  While I was stationed at Walker AFB, I do not recall any incidents\r\n  that may explain the information Mr Dennis provided in the\r\n  interviews. To my knowledge there was only one fatal aircraft\r\n  accident during my tour of duty and that accident involved a Walker\r\n  AFB based aircraft in the United Kingdom. I was not involved in any\r\n  aspect of that accident. I also do not recall any other incidents\r\n  such as automobile accidents or house fires that may be the source\r\n  of this information. Nor do I recall a nurse named Lt Naiomi Selff\r\n  or a nurse named Capt “Slats” Wilson. While at Walker AFB I did not\r\n  witness or hear rumors of anything that involved flying saucers,\r\n  aliens, or anything else of an extraterrestrial nature.\r\n\r\n  I am not part of a conspiracy to withhold information from either\r\n  the US government or the American public, there is no classified\r\n  information that I am withholding related to this inquiry and I\r\n  have not been threatened by US government persons concerning not\r\n  talking about this matter.\r\n\r\n  SIGNED:                       Sworn to and subscribed before me,\r\n                                an individual authorized to administer\r\n                                oaths, this 25th day of April 1996 at\r\n                                Aztec, NM\r\n\r\n  [Signature]                   [Signature]\r\n  Frank B.

We were down there looking\r\nfor banded and moss agate, which according to my uncle Ted and my\r\ncousin Victor was prevalent in the area. My brother being an amateur\r\nrock hound had wanted to get some of this. That was a way of showing us\r\naround the area. They had relatives down in Magdalena that they wanted\r\nto introduce us to.\r\n\r\nSo we had gone down there and we got down in the Horse Springs area and\r\nhad driven off onto the plains down an old rutted road for, oh, a mile\r\nor so and it seemed like a long ways. We parked the car, got out of the\r\ncar and walked down a hillside.\r\n\r\nThere’s a semi-forest, I guess you could say. It had pinon trees and\r\nscrub oak and stuff like that on it and we walked—well, not scrub oak,\r\nbut cedar—and walked down the hillside into an arroyo, a dry wash, and\r\nthen walked south down a dry wash toward where the agates were supposed\r\nto be at.\r\n\r\nAs we came around a bend in the arroyo that had pinon and cedar\r\ntrees growing, we were able to see farther ahead down the arroyo and\r\non the next ridge line there was a large silver disc shaped object\r\nwas embedded in this side of the ridge line ... there was debris\r\nand wreckage strewn about the area mainly this thing was intact. I\r\nwould estimate its size from an adult perspective to something like\r\n35 feet in diameter. I’ve heard other people who were there say they\r\nthought it was like 50 feet. But as an adult, I would say about 35\r\nfeet in diameter, quite large. When we got up to it there were four\r\nbodies there ... not human, there was two of them that were obviously\r\ndead, one of them was obviously very badly injured, and one of them\r\napparently suffered no ill effects ... or it didn’t appear to be\r\ninjured and was ambulatory, was mobile. It was just setting there next\r\nto the one...\r\n\r\nQ: Were they right next to the vehicle?\r\n\r\nA: Right next to it. Right under the edge of it. And this craft had\r\napparently come in from the east and bounced off one ridge line,\r\nplowing through this arroyo area and then crashed into the ridge line\r\nand embedded itself. They were sitting back under the edge, it was kind\r\nof tilted up like this and they were sitting back under the edge here.\r\nAnd I’m assuming that this one creature that was all right had laid\r\nthis material on the ground but it looked like unrolled tinfoil that\r\nthese other three creatures were laying on. Like it was trying—like\r\nyou do a person in shock, you know, a put him on a blanket, that kind\r\nof thing. And apparently it had some boxes there around it and had\r\napparently been trying to give first aid or help these other creatures\r\nwhen we first got there.\r\n\r\nAs we approached, the creature drew back like this, like it was in\r\nfear, like we were going to hurt it. And it wasn’t very long, you know,\r\nwe were trying to communicate with it, the adults were. It seemed\r\nto calm down and just sat there and kind of looked back and forth,\r\nwatching them, apparently trying to figure out what was going on...\r\n\r\nQ: What did it look like, a little bit more.\r\n\r\nA: These creatures, all of them, were, oh, about four foot tall, four\r\nand a half feet tall. They had very large heads that were shaped larger\r\non the top and they kind of tapered down, not to a real sharp point\r\nbut just tapered down where they were thin. And they had very large,\r\nvery large, oval shaped or almond shaped, I guess you could say, black\r\neyes. The head... They were so shiny, they had almost a bluish tint to\r\nthem when the light reflected off of them. Their skin coloration, the\r\nbest way that I could describe that is it was kind of a bluish tinted\r\nmilky-white. It looked like someone in shock. And the ones that were\r\nlaying on the ground were really—really looked more that way, more blue\r\nin the light, you know...\r\n\r\nQ: How about ears, nose, mouth?\r\n\r\nA: No, there were no visible ears on the creatures except like—if you\r\nwas just to cover your ear like this to where there was just a rise\r\nthere and then a hole without, you know, your ear lobe and the rest of\r\nthe area...\r\n\r\nQ: How about nose?\r\n\r\nA: It was—the nose was very, very small, almost imperceptible. It’s\r\nlike two holes, straight in; and the lips were just a straight line. It\r\nwas like a cut and you couldn’t see, just the lips like we have, it was\r\njust a slit. And...\r\n\r\nQ: What hair color? Sound?\r\n\r\nA: Pardon?\r\n\r\nQ: What hair color?\r\n\r\nA: There was no hair. They were completely bald.\r\n\r\nQ: And no sounds?\r\n\r\nA: I never heard a sound one, not out of any of the creatures including\r\nthe one that was...\r\n\r\nQ: Did you see fingers?\r\n\r\nA: Yes, they had fingers like this. They didn’t have a little finger.\r\nThey just had the thumb and three extra digits except the center digit\r\nwas longer and the other two were about the same size. They were very\r\nlong and slender and looked very delicate and I made the statement\r\nbefore and I’ll make it again, I think he would have made an excellent\r\nviolinist because of the structure of their hands.\r\n\r\nThey were wearing one piece suits. All of them were dressed exactly the\r\nsame. It was sort of a real shiny silverish gray color.\r\n\r\nQ: No zippers, buttons?\r\n\r\nA: No, I saw no zippers, no buttons.\r\n\r\nQ: Insignias?\r\n\r\nA: No, no insignias. The only thing that was different, you know, and\r\nthey all had this, but the only that was different from the silvery\r\ngray thing, the suit, was that down like a seam line, like there was\r\na seam on his shoulder and around the collar it was trimmed in what\r\nappeared to be maroon, like cording.\r\n\r\nThen the suits were continuous with their footwear. We could see right\r\nthis area down, it seemed to be less pliable then it was up here, like\r\nthis was a stiffer area, like they were boots or shoes or something.\r\nBut they were all dressed exactly the same.\r\n\r\nQ: Okay. So you and your family are talking back and forth, wondering\r\nwhat was going on, what did your family say? I mean...\r\n\r\nA: Well...\r\n\r\nQ: ...did they say anything?\r\n\r\nA: Yes, my brother, one of his first remarks I heard him say him say,\r\n“That’s a god damn spaceship.” You know there were bodies up there and,\r\nyou know, I was told not to go up there, which I didn’t. And...\r\n\r\nQ: How old was your brother at the time?\r\n\r\nA: He was in his early twenties, I think, 20, 21, something like that.\r\n\r\nQ: He was a lot older than you were?\r\n\r\nA: Oh, yes, considerably.\r\n\r\nWhen we got up there I kind of meandered off to one side. This thing\r\nwas cocked up and I was standing here, the bodies were here, and\r\neverybody else was kind of down here except my cousin Victor was over\r\nhere playing and looking in this gaping hole on the side of this disk.\r\nAnd it was shaped just like a discus except for a round dome was up on\r\ntop and there was this big gaping gash in there. We could see inside\r\nand it looked like a double hull.\r\n\r\nQ: How big—explain it? The gash.\r\n\r\nA: The dome?\r\n\r\nQ: No, the gash.\r\n\r\nA: Well, it covered the greater majority from the center of the craft\r\nout. It was just like a gaping hole in there. I mean I’m thinking, you\r\nknow, it’s like about 32, 35 feet in diameter so we’re talking about 17\r\nfeet maybe. Most of that one side was ripped open like that. You could\r\nsee inside and you could see another double hull, like—in there. And\r\nthere were just rows of components that was on there.\r\n\r\nAnd there were lights that flashed on and off. Some of them were steady\r\nand some were flashing. There was a lot of debris and stuff hanging out\r\nof the hole. There was evidence that there apparently had been fire. It\r\nlooked like it had been burned along the edge there. The gash...\r\n\r\nQ: Now this wasn’t a gash that could have been caused by the thing\r\ncoming in for the ground? It wasn’t at the leading edge of the vehicle?\r\n\r\nA: No, no. This was in the side like—it almost appeared it was\r\nelliptical. It almost appeared as if something the same shape as the\r\ndisk we were looking at had hit that same—you know, like it hit the\r\ndisk and left an imprint that pretty closely approximated the outside\r\ndiameter of the disk itself. And it appeared to be caved in looking,\r\nkind of like it hit them like this and it just crumpled and caved in\r\nand ripped it open.\r\n\r\nQ: Okay, so you’re there, you take all this in, everybody is mystified.\r\nWhat were the circumstances outside? Hot, cold?\r\n\r\nA: Very, very hot. Incredible to me, being the first time in New Mexico\r\nand coming from back east. I had dry heaves. It was like the inside of\r\nan oven. It was unbelievable to me. You know, the odd part about this\r\nwas that the closer you got to it, the cooler it was. And standing\r\nunder it in the shade there next to these creatures’ bodies, it was\r\nlike refrigerated air conditioning. And...\r\n\r\nQ: Did you feel air coming out of this thing?\r\n\r\nA: No, it was just like it was (inaudible).\r\n\r\nAnd I remember reaching up and putting my hand on the side of it but I\r\nthink I was afraid I was going to hit my head because there was enough\r\nroom for me as small child, you know, I was approximately the same size\r\nas these creatures, to walk up under there and stand there but I kind\r\nof did like that, put my hand up against this thing.\r\n\r\nQ: What did it feel like?\r\n\r\nA: It was ice cold. It felt like it just came out of a freezer.\r\n\r\nQ: Was it smooth? Was it rough?\r\n\r\nA: It was very smooth. It had a very smooth texture to it. It was\r\nobviously made out of metal. It was very solid and it was very cold,\r\nice cold.\r\n\r\nAnd there was a smell in the area. It smelled volatile, acrid, like\r\nacetone. And that seemed to be coming out of that gash, that smell. But\r\nthe closer you got to this thing, the cooler it was so, you know, I\r\nkind of remained there.\r\n\r\nAnd I guess that while they were over here, my father and my uncle Ted\r\nand my brother. Uncle Ted was trying to talk to this thing in Spanish\r\nand of course it didn’t understand a word he said. And dad tried to\r\ntalk to it and then they tried, you know, sign language and that didn’t\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nAnd I don’t know, for some reason, I just—I reached down and touched\r\nit, this one that was laying next to me. When I touched it I realized\r\nand I jumped back. It scared me. It startled me because I suddenly\r\nrealized that these weren’t dolls. I thought they were plastic dolls.\r\nAnd I—you know, it was still in my mind that these were dolls until I\r\ntouched it and then I realized, you know, this was a dead thing.\r\n\r\nI’d seen dead relatives before and unfortunately made a mistake one\r\ntime in touching a relative that was in a casket and I just knew this\r\nwas a dead thing and it scared me, and I ran around behind my father\r\nand my uncle and this thing was sitting there on the ground and it kept\r\nlooking back and forth. And it just had its hands like this in its lap,\r\nand just kept looking back and forth between the three of them and—like\r\nit was trying to understand.\r\n\r\nAnd all of a sudden it just turned and looked right straight at me\r\nbetween my uncle Ted and myself. And this is when—it was just like an\r\nexplosion of things in my head, things... I started, you know, feeling,\r\njust terrible depression and loneliness and fear and just, you know,\r\nawful, awful feelings that just suddenly burst in to my mind there. I\r\ndon’t know if that meant that it was communicating with me and I was\r\nthe only one there that it could communicate with because I was a kid.\r\nI don’t know.\r\n\r\nI turned and ran and I ran across the arroyo and up on the area that it\r\nhad bounced off of during the crash. I was just standing there looking\r\ndown at this scene, you know, at my family, and off in the distance I\r\ncould see cattle grazing. I could see a windmill and could see dust\r\ntrails out on the plains out there.\r\n\r\nAnd, oh, I was there for a while and then I came back down. I guess we\r\nwere there—Victor was, when I got back down there Victor was up in the\r\ncraft and Ted yelled at him to get out of there and Glen went over and\r\ngrabbed him by the belt and jerked him around...\r\n\r\nQ: That’s your brother?\r\n\r\nA: Yes.\r\n\r\nAnd jerked him off, says, “Get out because this thing may explode and\r\nkill us all,” you know, and then of course he went prowling around in\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nI was kind of standing off to one side looking. That’s why I knew that\r\nthere was—I can look off these rocks that I was standing on and look\r\nright into this thing. That’s why I knew, you know, about the lights\r\nand the components and stuff.\r\n\r\nAnd then I heard other people talking. I turned and there was a group\r\nof people coming up the arroyo from out on the plains from the south.\r\nThey had come up there and of course they walked up and was talking.\r\n\r\nQ: How many?\r\n\r\nA: There was an older man and five younger students.\r\n\r\nQ: Boys, girls?\r\n\r\nA: Three boys and two girls. And they were all, you know, introducing,\r\ntalking to my father and my uncle and my brother...\r\n\r\nQ: What did the older one look like?\r\n\r\nA: He was a very tall man, a very big man. He was wearing a pith helmet\r\nwhen he first came up, one of those kind of explorer helmets. And he\r\nwas bald and I know that because he had taken it off and he had, you\r\nknow, wiped it with a handkerchief and put it back on. He was a balding\r\nman. And he had a round face. He was very ruddy complected. A big man,\r\nand he apparently was a doctor because they kept calling him doctor and\r\nit was my understanding that it was an archeological group that was out\r\nthere on some kind of summer thing. And they talked and he apparently\r\nwas able to speak several foreign languages and he tried to talk to\r\nthis creature several times in different languages, again to no avail.\r\n\r\nQ: How did they happen to be there? Had he seen the thing...\r\n\r\nA: Well, they claim that they saw—they said they saw this thing come\r\ndown the night before in flight, you know, and they thought it was a\r\nmeteorite and they had talked about well, early in the morning, you\r\nknow, we’ll go over and see this, where this meteor came down, because\r\nthat’s what they thought it was.\r\n\r\nAnd when the sun came up the next morning, you know, and they got\r\nabout their business, got up and somebody looked over and said, you\r\nknow, they saw this shiny metal and stuff across the plains there and\r\nthey realized it wasn’t a meteorite, it may have been an airplane that\r\nhad crashed so they all decided to go over there and see if there was\r\nanybody left alive, you know, that was hurt that needed help.\r\n\r\nQ: They had driven over?\r\n\r\nA: No, they walked over apparently, the way I understand it. And it’s\r\nquite a ways across that plain so it had to take a very long time\r\nto do this or they may have had a vehicle, I don’t know. That’s an\r\nassumption, I think, on my part, where they walked.\r\n\r\nQ: Okay. So they’re around...\r\n\r\nA: But they came across...\r\n\r\nQ: ...with the family...\r\n\r\nA: ...the plains. I don’t know why I said that. I’m not sure if they\r\ndrove or not. I didn’t hear any cars.\r\n\r\nQ: And then somebody else shows up?\r\n\r\nA: Yes, they were down just, oh, 15 maybe 20 minutes tops, you know.\r\nAnd they were picking up things, some of the students. And this Dr.\r\nBuskirk, that they called him, this one girl went up and said, “Look,\r\ndoctor, wouldn’t this make a beautiful ring?” And she was holding what\r\nlooked like a red rod, a red tube that was some kind of silvery-red.\r\n\r\nAnd he kind of snapped at her, you know, “Put that down because you\r\ndon’t know what that thing is. That thing could hurt you. Don’t pick\r\nthis stuff up.”\r\n\r\nAnd she kind of said, “Well, yes, okay, doctor.” And then he went back\r\nto what he was doing and she walked away and put it in her pocket.\r\n\r\nAnd a lot of them were doing this, sort of picking up things and\r\nfeeling things. I was picking up things and feeling things. It was all\r\nkinds of material and metal, stuff like that. I heard it, well, we all\r\nheard it, the sound of a motor coming, like a truck. And I went back up\r\nthe incline area to the ridge line and I could see out there, there was\r\na truck coming up. It was an old pick-up truck. It was sort of a beige\r\ncolor, a tan colored van with an antenna on it. And it stopped and this\r\nguy got out and he’s wearing brown clothes. He’s got boots on and he’s\r\nwearing a straw hat, just like the kind that Harry Truman always wore,\r\nand he had wire rimmed glasses. He was a big man and he looked exactly\r\nlike Harry Truman to me. You know, I’d seen him in the Movietone News...\r\n\r\nQ: He was president then.\r\n\r\nA: Yes, I was well aware who Harry Truman was. Everybody was. He was\r\nkind of a hero, you know, and he just kind of looked like him except\r\nbigger, bigger. You know, I don’t think he—and he didn’t look as old\r\neither. His hair was kind of light gray.\r\n\r\nAnd he walked over there and they got to talking, you know, with\r\neverybody and he told them that he worked out on the plains out there\r\nand that he made maps and that he had seen the wreckage from out there\r\non the plains and he saw the people and he thought it was a plane wreck\r\nand, you know, that something was going on and he came over to see.\r\n\r\nAnd he hadn’t been there but just a very, very few minutes when we\r\nheard all kinds of motors and engines straining and stuff. And here\r\ncomes a military car with a big white star on the side of it followed\r\nby a six-by which is a military truck with a kind of canvas wagon, kind\r\nof a canvas thing over it and it’s full of soldiers. They’ve got guns.\r\nAnd right behind them is what we call a four-by which is like a medium\r\nsized jeep/truck situation and it had two big high whip antennas, all\r\nkinds of radio gear in the back and a guy back there with ear phones\r\nand stuff on and he’s, you know, working these radios. And they all\r\npulled up and stopped.\r\n\r\nQ: Which direction did they come from, do you know?\r\n\r\nA: They came from the north, from the Horse Springs area, right...\r\n\r\nQ: So they could have come off the highway there...\r\n\r\nA: Oh, yes. I’m sure that’s exactly how they got there. They come off\r\nthe highway, the same way we did. Well, in the meantime, when they\r\nstopped, this black soldier, this sergeant, the reason I know he was\r\na sergeant, my brother told me he was, and he got out of this car and\r\nthen a guy got out on the other side and he was a, Glen said he was a\r\ncaptain, he told me later he was a captain and this guy had orange and\r\nred hair. So all the soldiers and them came running over there pointing\r\nguns at people, telling them, “Get away, get away, get away,” you know?\r\nAnd when this creature saw these people, the military, he went nuts. He\r\nwent into an absolute panic, worse than what he did when he saw us.\r\n\r\nQ: Did he move around or just his eyes or...\r\n\r\nA: He just, he just...\r\n\r\nQ: Oh, okay.\r\n\r\nA: ...went crazy. And it was like...\r\n\r\nQ: Like he was scared?\r\n\r\nA: Yes, like he was looking for a place to run and hide.\r\n\r\nQ: But he never got up?\r\n\r\nA: He never got up. He never left the beings that were next to him.\r\n\r\nAnd this red headed officer, this guy was a real butt hole. He made all\r\nthe threats. He threatened to have people shot.\r\n\r\nQ: Everybody?\r\n\r\nA: He went, “Get away, get away,” you know, “We’ll shoot. Get away\r\nfrom there. This is a military secret.” You know, just screaming and\r\nhollering. He told my uncle and my father that if they didn’t want to\r\nspend the rest of their life in prison they would never say anything\r\nabout what they saw there, if they ever wanted to see us kids again,\r\nthey’d take the kids away. They’d never see the kids, you know, meaning\r\nme and Victor. That we’d better keep our mouths shut because if we did\r\nnot, this is what was going to happen. They were threatening people and\r\npushing people...\r\n\r\nQ: The students as well and Dr. Buskirk?\r\n\r\nA: Oh, yes. They were hustling everybody. And one of the soldiers\r\npushed my uncle. He had a rifle like this and he shoved him back like\r\nthat. Well, that was something you didn’t do to my uncle Ted. Ted had\r\na violent temper. And he grabbed the rifle and reached over top and\r\nsmacked this guy and dropped him right there. And Ted would go out and\r\nfight, heck, this guy’s a cowboy. He’ll hit you in a minute.\r\n\r\nAnd of course when he did that there was bolts opened and I guess\r\ncocking, they were cocking their rifles. They were pointing guns at\r\npeople and everybody Buskirk and Glen and dad grabbed him, you know,\r\npulled him back and got him away. “No, don’t, Ted, they’re going to\r\nshoot. Don’t do that.” You know, trying to stop this. And I think we\r\ncame very close to having someone shot.\r\n\r\nThen they really started threatening, you know, and they...\r\n\r\nQ: Did the redhead do all the talking, pretty much?\r\n\r\nA: Pretty much. Except once in a while the sergeant would, you know,\r\nchime in and make statements like that to other people in response to\r\nthe redhead. But mainly it was the redhead...\r\n\r\nQ: Was there a name tag?\r\n\r\nA: Yes, sir, there was. His name was Armstrong. And I’m not sure if I\r\nknow that from having read it or know that from remembering it and now\r\nbeing able to read it in my memory, or if someone said that to me. But\r\nhis name was Armstrong, it was right here on his uniform.\r\n\r\nQ: But he chased you guys away pretty quick?\r\n\r\nA: Yes, yes, he did.\r\n\r\nAnd they herded us up like cattle and we were just up the arroyo, back\r\nin the direction we came from, over the protest of this Dr. Buskirk who\r\nsaid, “No, no, we’ve got to go the other way. We came from over there.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t care where you came from, get your ass up the arroyo.”\r\n\r\nAnd they ran us up the arroyo and...\r\n\r\nQ: So you get to your car again?\r\n\r\nA: Oh, right.\r\n\r\nNow they took us up the arroyo and just over the hill we came down,\r\nthey broke us off and moved us up the hill.\r\n\r\nNow this whole time, no one has ever frisked us down, no one has ever\r\nchecked our pockets to see if we picked up any of this material and\r\nthis girl, Agnes, still had that stuff in her pocket and some of the\r\nother students had stuff. To my knowledge, up to that point, they had\r\nnot been searched. Whether they did so afterward, I don’t know. They\r\nnever searched us, ever. They ran us back up the hill and when we got\r\nto where the car was parked, where dad had parked the car up there,\r\nthere’s a jeep with a guy sitting in the back and there is a mounted\r\nmachine gun in the back of this jeep and all of these soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe jeep pulls out, we’re told to get in the car, we follow the jeep,\r\nand the soldiers go with us all the way back out to the highway. When\r\nwe get back out to the highway, they set us right there. They wouldn’t\r\nlet us out of the car. They wouldn’t let us move forward. I don’t know\r\nwhether they were making a decision or what.\r\n\r\nWhen we got out to the highway, this place was absolutely full of\r\nmilitary personnel, military equipment. There was airplanes sitting out\r\nthere that they had landed on the highway.\r\n\r\nQ: Did you see any airplanes when you were back at the site?\r\n\r\nA: Yes, there was airplanes in the sky but nobody thought much about.\r\nYou know, I didn’t think anything about it. I was used to airplanes\r\nbeing in the sky, having been raised in Indianapolis, Indiana, the home\r\nof the Norden bombsight, you know, the sky was always full of military\r\naircraft at night.\r\n\r\nAnd when we get back on to the highway, there’s observation aircraft,\r\nyou know, high winged aircraft, and there’s one, of what I know now to\r\nbe a C-47 setting there. And how we didn’t hear that land is beyond me\r\nand how he landed—well, of course, I guess you could land it if you’re\r\na good pilot out there as there were no poles or anything.\r\n\r\nAnd it was—they had torn the fence down on the north side of the highway\r\nand all this equipment was setting back up there. The plane was up\r\nthere and they were taking stuff out of the plane. There was military\r\nambulances and there were trucks with—like wreckers, cranes on them.\r\nAnd there was tankers, like maybe had fuel or water in them. There was\r\njust—everywhere you looked there was military.\r\n\r\nQ: A major recovery operation?\r\n\r\nA: Yes, it looked like an invasion force. It really did.\r\n\r\nAnd they were all wearing these light khaki uniforms. They didn’t look\r\nlike, you know, olive drabs. They were light khaki and they all had the\r\nsame patch over their—that kind of blue funny patch with the circles on\r\nit, was on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nAnd a lot...\r\n\r\nQ: Do you have a clue as to where they came from? Did your brother or\r\nyour uncle?\r\n\r\nA: No. I don’t know where they came from. No, I don’t think anybody\r\never ascertained that.\r\n\r\nThere were a lot of MP patches and some of them were wearing\r\nnightsticks off of these webbed utility belts. They had night sticks\r\nand they had .45’s in holsters, you know, the automatics, full\r\nholsters. And these were the people that were giving most of the orders.\r\n\r\nThey had the road barricaded off out there and we sat there for a very\r\nlong time and, you know, we were getting thirsty and everything and we\r\nasked if we could go back to Horse Springs to get some water.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, no. You can’t through there.”\r\n\r\nAnd right after that, they said, “Now you just turn around and you head\r\nout of here now and you go to Socorro,” and this is the redhead again,\r\n“Keep your mouths shut. Just keep going and don’t look back.”\r\n\r\nWell, as we drove away, you know, dad, “The hell with it, we’ll go to\r\nMagdalena. We’ll get water in Magdalena.” You know, because that’s\r\nwhere John Trujillo lived, a relative of Ted’s.\r\n\r\nAnd so as we drove away, I was looking out the back window and I could\r\nsee Dr. Buskirk and these kids and that guy, the guy in the pick-up was\r\nstanding there and this Dr. Buskirk was doing just like this in this\r\nredheaded officer’s face and he kept pointing back behind him and I\r\nguess that meant, you know, we’ve got to go back that way and he was\r\nfed up with this guy or something and he was shaking his finger in his\r\nface when they were yelling at each other and that’s pretty much the\r\nlast I saw of the whole situation. I don’t know what happened after\r\nthat because we just kept going.\r\n\r\n                                 (END)\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Transcript of Interview with\r\n                          W. Glenn Dennis[*]\r\n                     (Alleged firsthand witness to\r\n                  events at the Roswell AAF hospital)\r\n\r\n  [*] W. Glenn Dennis, interview with Karl T. Pflock, November 2,\r\n  1992.\r\n\r\nQ: You started getting calls from the base mortuary officer is that\r\nright, some time in the afternoon on some day in July [1947].\r\n\r\nA: Right after noon, yeah.\r\n\r\nQ: Do you recall, was that before the story appeared in the [Roswell\r\nDaily] Record?\r\n\r\nA: I don’t know. I’m sure it was. I can’t honestly say, but I don’t\r\nthink the paper came out until the next day, I don’t think. I’m just\r\nassuming that.\r\n\r\nQ: I understand. When things like that happen to me way after the fact\r\nI try to remember, and I wasn’t sure if you had any recollection or\r\nnot. It was the base mortuary officer who called you, not any of the\r\nMDs out there.\r\n\r\nA: No.\r\n\r\nQ: He was just, the mortuary officer was just the guy...\r\n\r\nA: We used to have a standing joke. What did you do that was so bad\r\nthey made you the mortuary officer.\r\n\r\nQ: Exactly.\r\n\r\nA: He wasn’t a doctor or anything, but he was an officer and he was\r\nprobably some old boy they was trying to figure out something to do\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nWe used to all have them come in, even the officer himself, say, “God,\r\nI didn’t know I screwed up that bad.”\r\n\r\nQ: Was this a guy you’d worked with before? Somebody you knew real well?\r\n\r\nA: No. Those guys come and go.\r\n\r\nQ: I realize that. You don’t remember what his name was or anything\r\nlike that?\r\n\r\nA: No. I’m like Bob [Shirkey]. I think if I would see it or heard it\r\nor something I might. Those guys, they were in and out. The mortuary\r\nofficer, usually they would appoint some sergeant or somebody. The\r\nonly time the doctors were involved is when you’d have an embalming\r\ninspection or dress inspection where the doctors came in and examined\r\nthe body to make sure everything was right. You had another inspection\r\nto make sure their dog tags, make sure all the medals and everything...\r\n\r\nThey always had two crews of inspectors. The doctors were only involved\r\nin the cause of death or the autopsies or identification process,\r\ndental charts and all that. After they did their work, then a doctor\r\nwould always come in and make sure the body was embalmed because [they]\r\nknow more about it than the other people. But they were involved\r\nbefore. You know.\r\n\r\nQ: The reason they contacted you was because Burt Ballard’s funeral\r\nhome up here had a contract with the base, right?\r\n\r\nA: Yeah.\r\n\r\nQ: You worked for Burt for a lot of years, didn’t you?\r\n\r\nA: Yeah, a long time.\r\n\r\nQ: When did you first go to work for him?\r\n\r\nA: I went to work for him, I was hanging around the funeral home when\r\nI was like a freshman in high school. I’d want to make some extra\r\nmoney. “I’ll give you 50 cents to wash the hearse.” I knew his daughter\r\nreal well. We were all in school together. That’s where I really got\r\ninvolved in the funeral home. I just kind of worked my way in it.\r\n\r\nQ: He basically taught you the trade and all that.\r\n\r\nA: Oh, yeah. My folks weren’t in the funeral business.\r\n\r\nQ: The reason I was curious about it was because when I went back...\r\nI’m one of these guys that goes to Washington and then gets fed up\r\nand leaves and swears I’m never going to go back, and then I go\r\nback anyway. But the last time I went back and did that, I shared a\r\ntownhouse with a guy for awhile who was a mortician from Michigan. But\r\nhe had to go through all this formal training and all this rigmarole...\r\n\r\nA: No. That started in (inaudible). Maybe you don’t want to hear\r\nthis, but I was in the 9th grade, and this teacher was going around\r\nand wanted us to write a composition on what we wanted to be when we\r\ngraduated from school. What were our future plans. I was kind of a wise\r\nguy, I guess I must have been, but I said undertaker, and I don’t even\r\nknow why. All the girls squealed, so I got a little attention. Then\r\nshe said okay, if that’s what you want to do then you’ve got a week,\r\nyou bring me your composition. I want to know why you want to be an\r\nundertaker.\r\n\r\nSo I went to the funeral home. They didn’t have any books in those days\r\nor anything, but that’s where I went. That’s why I got involved in it,\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\nQ: How long were you in that business before you... I know you ran the\r\nWortley Hotel up in Lincoln [N.M.].\r\n\r\nA: Oh, that was after I retired.\r\n\r\nQ: Oh, I see, you retired from the mortuary business...\r\n\r\nA: Oh, yeah. I was in the funeral business 33 years.\r\n\r\nQ: All the time with Ballard?\r\n\r\nA: Oh no, I had my own funeral home over in Las Cruces [N.M.], and one\r\nin Socorro [N.M.].\r\n\r\nQ: Oh, okay.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of that, do you know Norman Todd or his family?\r\n\r\nA: His dad and I took the state board together. He was at Clovis\r\n[N.M.]. Norman’s his son isn’t it?\r\n\r\nQ: Yeah. He’s a lawyer over in Las Cruces [N.M.]. His...\r\n\r\nA: Wasn’t his dad the funeral director in Clovis [N.M.]?\r\n\r\nQ: I think so. The reason I know him is because Mike Cook, who is Steve\r\nSchiff’s press secretary, and he have been friends ever since they were\r\nin kindergarten together. It turns out that Iris Todd, I guess his\r\nstepmother, is the niece of Loretta Proctor. So talk about small world.\r\n\r\nYou got these calls from the mortuary officer who was asking you all\r\nthese questions. We don’t have to go back through all of this. Then at\r\nsome point you decided to go out to the base. What took you to the base?\r\n\r\nA: At some point I didn’t decide, that’s not correct. Somebody wrote\r\nthat, but I don’t think it’s right. The way I ended up out at the base\r\nlater, we had the ambulance service. The way I got it, the ambulance\r\nservice, I got a call, was an airman that was hurt. I took him to the\r\nbase. The best I remember, he wasn’t on a stretcher or anything because\r\nwe walked up the ramp and he sat up in the front seat with me. So he\r\nweren’t real bad and weren’t dying. Anyway... This guy walked in, I\r\nwalked him in. Where I usually park the ambulance, there was a field\r\nambulance there. I had to go back up to the front. The airman and I\r\nwalked up the ramps. That’s why I went to the base.\r\n\r\nQ: The hospital in those days was apparently a complex of buildings,\r\nright?\r\n\r\nA: Yeah. Kind of like Bob [Shirkey] said, like the officer’s club.\r\nThey’re all wooden barrack types.\r\n\r\nQ: So the building that’s out there now, the rehab center is a\r\ncompletely new building and had nothing to do with that.\r\n\r\nA2 [Bob Shirkey]: No. Think of a long walkway, like a tunnel, attached\r\nto the front of a series of...\r\n\r\nQ: I know just what you’re talking about.\r\n\r\nA: ...with a little of breezeway between each building, the best I\r\nremember it. Isn’t that right. Bob?\r\n\r\nA2 [Bob Shirkey]: Yeah. Here was the building and you came out the\r\nfront door and you went down this walkway, which I just said, like a\r\ntunnel. You could see from one end to the other, but all these separate\r\nbuildings which were different wings of the hospital.\r\n\r\nQ: This was the infirmary where you took the airman, right?\r\n\r\nA: There were some ramps there, I think the old ramp’s still there. It\r\nwas. Anyway, that’s the kind of buildings they were. You don’t see it\r\ntoday, no.\r\n\r\nQ: I knew that the building, most of it, was new, but I wasn’t sure if\r\nthey’d built onto it...\r\n\r\nA: That had been worked over two or three times.\r\n\r\nQ: When you look at it looks like it’s been one of these things where\r\nthey’ve added things to it.\r\n\r\nSo you pulled around behind the infirmary, basically.\r\n\r\nA: It was a pretty tight squeeze in there. You couldn’t get very many\r\ncars in there.\r\n\r\nQ: How many of those ambulances were back there?\r\n\r\nA: There were three old box ambulances. I call them box ambulance. I\r\nguess you call them... I wasn’t in the military so I don’t know what\r\nall the terms were.\r\n\r\nQ: Like these old field ambulances.\r\n\r\nA: They’ve got the old square field ambulances, you know.\r\n\r\nQ: The airman walked up that ramp with you. Both of you guys went\r\ninto...\r\n\r\nA: The airman and I both went in.\r\n\r\nQ: Did he see that stuff in...\r\n\r\nA: He wasn’t paying any attention because he had, I had a tourniquet\r\nand towel over his busted nose, and he went right on in.\r\n\r\nQ: Got himself into a little trouble in town, did he?\r\n\r\nA: Rode an old motorcycle. The reason I remember it is because he had\r\nan old Indian motorcycle, and I’d just bought one. I paid $40 for one\r\nand he [rode] one, and I didn’t have any fenders, and I was thinking of\r\nmaybe of...\r\n\r\nQ: So you took him in there, and then basically after you got him taken\r\ncare of you figured you’d go look up your friend, the nurse.\r\n\r\nLet’s get that straight.\r\n\r\nA: Stan Friedman, I think, somebody thought that I was having a\r\nrelationship with this nurse. I was not. This girl wouldn’t even think\r\nabout going with me, and she was going strictly, when she got her\r\ntime paid back to the service she was going into an order of the nuns,\r\nsisters, and she was going to be in education and later on she changed\r\nto the nursing deal. The only reason she was in it, because her folks\r\nwere in debt and she went in the service to get her education. She got\r\nher education and then she was going to pay back the church what they\r\nowed her. Her whole thing in life was, from the day she was born, her\r\nlife was planned that she was going to be in an order.\r\n\r\nQ: Did she ever tell you which order that was?\r\n\r\nA: It was in St. Paul, Minnesota. That’s all I know.\r\n\r\nQ: That’s where she was from.\r\n\r\nA: That’s where she was born and raised. She never went out of the city\r\nuntil she went to... My understanding was she never went anywhere and\r\nshe never lived anywhere. She was raised up from the time... Strictly\r\nraised by the church. That was the only life she ever planned. She\r\nwouldn’t date a man if her life depended on it. She’d get around and\r\ntalk and everything, but there was no way. But everybody said I was\r\ngoing to marry her and... That’s bull shit.\r\n\r\nQ: The implication was that she was cute and...\r\n\r\nA: She was cute. I could have been interested. If I wouldn’t have\r\nplayed second fiddle to the Catholic church, because that’s what she\r\nwould have been.\r\n\r\nQ: How did you get to know her, just being out there on the base?\r\n\r\nA: The ambulance service. You go out there, and you’ve got your splints\r\non a guy, you’ve got first aid, whatever, you can’t just throw them off\r\nof your stretcher. You maybe help them... Sometimes you’re out there\r\ntwo hours or three. Then while you’re waiting to get your equipment\r\nback you sit in the coat room with the doctors and with the nurse’s\r\nquarters. That’s where we always had our cokes and stuff.\r\n\r\nQ: So you’d just shoot the breeze with whoever’s around.\r\n\r\nA: You get to know these people. That’s the only way. See, she’d only\r\nbeen there less than three months. Of course, I’m a crazy son of a\r\ngun... Nearly everybody remembered her. She was a good looking little\r\nthing, a beautiful little girl. We thought she was kind of lonely.\r\n\r\nQ: As you well know, there’s been a major effort to try to find her.\r\n\r\n[Skip in tape]\r\n\r\nA: She was out here less than three months.\r\n\r\nQ: So you went back there. Tell me what happened.\r\n\r\nA: I started back there, and that’s when I got in trouble. I saw this\r\nofficer standing there, and I saw this debris in the back of the\r\nambulance. Two of them was full of debris. Like Bob [Shirkey] saw a\r\nbunch little stuff, and there was a couple of pretty good sized.\r\n\r\nQ: Two of the three ambulances had stuff...\r\n\r\nA: One of them’s door was closed, but the other two... There was two\r\nMPs standing right out, kind of just leaning up against the back of\r\nthose. I remember.\r\n\r\nQ: Did they challenge you when you tried to go in?\r\n\r\nA: No... Evidently because I drove up with that airman, and they just\r\nfigured whatever.\r\n\r\nAnother thing, when I was there, all the people that was there, that\r\nnurse was the only person I saw that was permanent station. Everybody\r\nelse was all new in that whole hospital operation. Even in the coke\r\nroom, there wasn’t anybody in there that I knew. I started back and got\r\nto the door, and I saw this...\r\n\r\n(Pause)\r\n\r\nWe’ve been friends for years, but I don’t want to talk with him around.\r\n\r\nQ: So the stuff you saw, you said it was not aluminum...\r\n\r\nA: ...looked like hot stainless steel when it got hot. When you put\r\nflame on stainless, see, I do sculpture work and all that, and I know\r\nwhat the stuff looks like.\r\n\r\nQ: Oh, you’re a sculpture? I didn’t know that?\r\n\r\nA: Yeah, I’ve been doing it for years. I had my own foundry... I did. I\r\ndon’t do it any more. I have my stuff done. But anyway, this stuff was\r\na blue purplish, it looked like hot stainless steel, is what it looked\r\nlike. Steel that got hot. It didn’t look like aluminum, it wasn’t even\r\nmelted like aluminum. I don’t even think it was melted, just like a\r\nbunch of fragments.\r\n\r\nQ: But there were some bigger things in there besides the fragments,\r\nright?\r\n\r\nA: Yeah. There were was two pieces.\r\n\r\nAnyway, do you want to go back to the nurse?\r\n\r\nQ: Yes, please.\r\n\r\nA: I started back, see, and this captain was standing there, and\r\nnaturally, I just thought we had a plane crash. When we had that,\r\nwe used to fill up the ambulances and everything else. It would\r\n(inaudible) for you to have a hand here or an arm or a foot or\r\nsomething. You know what I’m talking about. Then you’ve got to get\r\nin and take all that stuff and separate it and put those bodies back\r\ntogether with identification. That’s what you’ve got to do. I thought\r\nwe had a crash.\r\n\r\nI saw this guy, I didn’t know him. He was standing there at the door.\r\n\r\nQ: Just inside?\r\n\r\nA: Just kind of standing like in between the door of this room up\r\nthere. I was going down the hall. I said, “Sir, it looks like we had a\r\nplane crash. Do I need to go in and get ready for it?”\r\n\r\nQ: This was an officer?\r\n\r\nA: Yeah, he was a captain. I remember the bars on his [inaudible]. He\r\nsaid, “Who are you?” I told him I was from the funeral home, and he\r\nsaid, “Wait right there, don’t move.”\r\n\r\nThen he came back, that’s when the two MPs came up. When the nurse came\r\nout, we started down the hall and that’s when somebody in the back of\r\nus said, “Bring that son of a bitch back.” That’s when the redheaded\r\ncaptain asked where the sergeant came in right there. Then they took me\r\non out. As I was going down the hall, she came out of, like Bob said,\r\nout of this room, and there was two guys in back of her, and they all\r\nhad towels over their face.\r\n\r\nShe saw me and she said, “Glenn, what are you doing here? Get out of\r\nhere, you’re going to get in a lot of trouble. How did you get in\r\nhere?” She said that two or three times. She was sick.\r\n\r\nQ: This is when you were talking to that first officer?\r\n\r\nA: Yeah. He just told the MPs to take me back to the funeral home.\r\n\r\nQ: He had just told them that, and then she appeared at that point?\r\n\r\nA: He told them to take me to the funeral home, and we started down the\r\nhall, back out the hall, and that’s when she came out of another room\r\nwith these other two guys. What happened, she told me the next day,\r\nthey were all sick because those little bodies were in those sacks, and\r\ntwo of them were very mangled and the smell was horrible and one was\r\nwhole and two of them were very badly mangled.\r\n\r\nQ: Did you get a whiff of that stuff yourself?\r\n\r\nA: No, evidently not. If I would have, I would have known what it was.\r\nI worked on a hell of a lot of stuff.\r\n\r\nQ: In that tape you talked about working on floaters and all that kind\r\nof stuff.\r\n\r\nA: You know.\r\n\r\nQ: I haven’t had professional experience in it, but I’ve been involved\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nA: In New Mexico you’ve got this hot 100 degree stuff, and you’ve got\r\nbodies out there two or three days, and (inaudible).\r\n\r\nQ: This red headed guy, what was his rank, do you remember?\r\n\r\nA: I think he was a captain. It seemed to me like he had on some bars.\r\n\r\nQ: When he first appeared and started getting, essentially, pretty\r\nrough, was the sergeant around at that time, or did he show up...\r\n\r\nA: He was kind of beside of him. I think they were standing there....\r\nYeah, they were definitely standing there together. I don’t know if\r\nthey walked in together, because I didn’t see them until they turned me\r\naround.\r\n\r\nQ: Was there a lot of activity at that time? Were there people...\r\n\r\nA: People were [fastened] everywhere. And the odd part of it was, there\r\nwasn’t anybody, wasn’t any of our regular people. These were all people\r\nthat I’d never seen before. That’s why I got in so much trouble. I’d\r\nnever seen these guys.\r\n\r\nQ: These were not any of the guys that would ordinarily recognize you\r\nas somebody who would...\r\n\r\nA: And they sure as hell didn’t want me there, you know that.\r\n\r\nQ: When he says, “Get him out of there,” the redhead, did he make any\r\nthreats to you himself? Did he say, “Don’t say anything about this,\r\nforget it...”\r\n\r\nA: He said, just like that. He says, “Now listen, Mister, you don’t\r\ngo back into town starting a bunch of damn rumors.” This guy swore as\r\nmuch as I do. Anyway, he said, “Don’t start a bunch of damn rumors,\r\nbecause nothing happened out here. There’s no plane crashes. Nothing’s\r\nhappened. You don’t go in and start.” Then he told the MPs, “Get the\r\nson of a bitch out of here.”\r\n\r\nThat’s when I said, right then, I said, “Look, Mister, I’m a civilian,\r\nand you can’t do a damn thing to me, you go to hell.” That’s when he\r\nsaid, “Listen, Mister, somebody will be picking your bones out of the\r\nsand.”\r\n\r\nThen the black sergeant said, “Sir, he would make good dog food,” or\r\nsomething like that. I remember the dog food.\r\n\r\nThe next morning at 6:00 o’clock the sheriff was out at my dad’s house\r\nand told my dad, “Glenn may be in a lot of trouble with the base, and\r\ntell him to keep his mouth shut.”\r\n\r\nI never told my story to anybody, but my dad came up, I was living in a\r\nroom at the funeral home. He came up and got me out of bed and wanted\r\nto know what I’d done. He was a very patriotic old man, and he said,\r\n“If you done anything against our government, I’ll take care of it.”\r\n\r\nQ: When was this?\r\n\r\nA: The next morning.\r\n\r\nQ: You were saying what the heck? What’s going on?\r\n\r\nA: Yeah. I said, well hey... He said, George Wilcox—the sheriff and my\r\ndad were real good friends, and he said George tells me you’re in a lot\r\nof trouble out there. He wasn’t going to leave, and I told my dad the\r\nstory. He got all upset because they threatened me and all this kind of\r\nstuff.\r\n\r\nI didn’t see the nurse, then, until the next day. After I saw her, then\r\nI kept calling. When I got back to the funeral home I started calling,\r\nbecause she was in trouble and so was I.\r\n\r\nQ: It was the next morning after you’d been hustled out of there that\r\nyour dad came by to see you.\r\n\r\nA: Yeah, 6:00 o’clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nQ: He’d been called by the sheriff...\r\n\r\nA: The sheriff went to my mother and dad’s house, and at 6:00\r\no’clock... My dad always got up early, sat and had coffee. He was an\r\nold carpenter and building contractor. He and George were old friends\r\nbecause he used to go hunting, and dad was making gun stocks, so they\r\nwere good friends. They used to play some kind of domino games or 42,\r\nwhatever you call it. They were good friends.\r\n\r\nQ: So the sheriff went by to see your dad...\r\n\r\nA: Dad said he was there at 6:00 o’clock.\r\n\r\nQ: The sheriff came by early in the morning and then your dad\r\nimmediately came from home and came to see you.\r\n\r\nA: After George Wilcox left, my dad came up to the funeral home and\r\nwanted to know what I did.\r\n\r\nQ: Did your dad say why the sheriff... Had the sheriff been contacted\r\nby the base, or...\r\n\r\nA: No, he just said, he was concerned about what I’d done, how I’d got\r\nin trouble.\r\n\r\nQ: Do you remember what he told you about what Wilcox told him?\r\n\r\nA: He just said George said I was in trouble at the base, and what did\r\nI do.\r\n\r\nQ: Then after having this rude awakening, you then... Did you call the\r\nnurse?\r\n\r\nA: Well, yeah, this was in mid-morning. I remember I finally, I waited\r\nuntil kind of, well, it must have been 9:00 o’clock or so, and I\r\ncalled. I knew the work station that she always worked at. She was a\r\ngeneral nurse. They didn’t specialize. Just orderlies and everybody was\r\non general duty in those days. I was informed that she wasn’t there,\r\nshe wasn’t working. She wasn’t working that day.\r\n\r\nQ: It was one of the other nurses that you talked to?\r\n\r\nA: Yeah, it was an old girl by the name of Wilson, Captain Wilson. I\r\nasked her, I said “what happened?” She said, “Glenn, I don’t know what\r\nhappened, but she’s not on duty. I’ll try to get the word to her that\r\nyou want to talk to her.” She was wanting to talk to me, but she was\r\nsick. She was in total shock.\r\n\r\nQ: Did she tell you that later, that she was sick?\r\n\r\nA: I knew she was sick. She came out with that towel. She said, she and\r\nthe two doctors were sick. Then at the Officers’ Club, she said I want\r\nto know what happened to you, and I’ll tell you what happened to me.\r\nThe only way we ever got to the Officers’ Club, the old regular group\r\nsaid you don’t go anywhere, you keep your mouth shut, [inaudible] said\r\nthat. The old group, they would have known us. It probably wouldn’t\r\nhave mattered. But these people, hell, these people didn’t know us.\r\nAnd of course I had a pass, and I had an associate membership to the\r\nOfficers’ Club, the funeral home did, so I could go as I pleased. I had\r\nfree access to the base.\r\n\r\nQ: Did you meet her at the club?\r\n\r\nA: She said she’d meet me over there. She was sick. She said I’ll meet\r\nyou there.\r\n\r\nQ: When you got there, she was at the club?\r\n\r\nA: She was walking up when I drove up. She walked over. It wasn’t very\r\nfar from the hospital.\r\n\r\nQ: She walked from the hospital or...\r\n\r\nA: From the nurse’s quarters.\r\n\r\nQ: Let me back up to the event with the MPs. They physically hustled\r\nyou out of the hospital...\r\n\r\nA: Well, they didn’t carry me out, they said, “Come on, we’re taking\r\nyou back,” one on each side. They didn’t have their hands on me or\r\nforcing me.\r\n\r\nQ: I’ve forgotten which one of the accounts has them lifting you right\r\noff your feet and all that kind of stuff.\r\n\r\nA: No. They may have got me by the elbow, but that was that. They were\r\nnice guys. They were doing what they were told to do.\r\n\r\nQ: They got you to the ambulance. Did they follow you back to the\r\nfuneral home?\r\n\r\nA: One followed me in a pickup and the other one sat in the seat with\r\nme.\r\n\r\nQ: Oh, I see, he actually rode with you in the ambulance.\r\n\r\nA: He rode with me, and the other one drove a pickup and picked him up.\r\nThey had a pickup.\r\n\r\nQ: Did the guy riding with you say anything about what was going on?\r\n\r\nA: He said he didn’t know what was going on. That was the first thing I\r\nsaid, “What in the hell’s going on?” You know. He said, “You know more\r\nabout it than we do,” something similar to that. I don’t know the exact\r\nwords, but he didn’t know anything.\r\n\r\nQ: Now we’re back to the Officers’ Club and you met her there. When you\r\nsaw her, how did she look?\r\n\r\nA: Like a nervous wreck. Her hair wasn’t combed or nothing. She said\r\nshe’d been sick all night crying and everything else, and she was still\r\ncrying. She was hysterical. She put her hands over her face and said\r\nI can’t believe it. The most horrible thing she’d ever seen. She was\r\nreally in bad shape.\r\n\r\nQ: You called her and wanted to get in touch with her to talk with her\r\nabout what happened.\r\n\r\nA: I was curious.\r\n\r\nQ: Did she seem reluctant at first to talk to you about it?\r\n\r\nA: No, she said I’ve got to talk to you. I want to know what happened\r\nto you. She said I’ve got to talk to somebody, and that was it. You\r\nknow, I’d see her a lot. I knew all those old girls out there, you know.\r\n\r\nQ: Did she give you any indication or any reason to believe that she\r\nhad been told to keep her mouth shut about it, or...\r\n\r\nA: Well, yeah, because I’ll tell you what. She had this drawing on the\r\nback of a prescription pad, these little bodies, it was on the back,\r\na little small thing on the back of a prescription pad. She said,\r\n“I’m going to show you something, and you have to give me your sacred\r\noath that you won’t tell anybody when you got this and you won’t ever\r\nmention my name, because I will get in a lot of trouble.” That’s what\r\nshe said. “I will get in a lot of trouble.”\r\n\r\nQ: She didn’t say specifically that somebody had...\r\n\r\nA: No, she just said, “I will get in a lot of trouble.” She said, “Will\r\nyou do that?” I said, “Sure.”\r\n\r\nShe showed me that. And she had it written on the back like I had it on\r\nthe back of that, you have my drawing, where I said note, and all that.\r\nThat’s what she said.\r\n\r\nQ: She let you keep that, she gave it to you?\r\n\r\nA: Yeah, she said you look at it and you throw it away. I never did. I\r\nwent and took it back and put it in my personal file.\r\n\r\nQ: Which subsequently got tossed, apparently.\r\n\r\nA: Well, all the files got tossed.\r\n\r\nQ: What happened?\r\n\r\nA: Well, the funeral home, I hired some guys, the manager up there\r\nnow [was there] before I left, and Raymond said that he doesn’t know,\r\nbecause when he was working up there was another manager, and he\r\nsaid he thought Joe [Lucas] told (inaudible). Of course Joe and I\r\nweren’t very good friends and we’d had some problems over the funeral\r\nbusiness, and he said Joe found my files. He said I know he went\r\nthrough everything you had.\r\n\r\nHe and I had a partnership in a business, and I put up all the money\r\nand it went sour and so we had problems.\r\n\r\nQ: You and Stan Friedman actually made an effort to try and find that,\r\ndidn’t you?\r\n\r\nA: We went down there. The old file was right where I said it was, it\r\nwas still there. But it was, Stan will tell you, we went down in this\r\nold basement, and I knew exactly... See, I kept files on every case\r\nthat I was involved in, murders, anything that I went to court on, that\r\nI was a witness on, I kept all that. I called those my personal files.\r\nIf I ever had to go back with the insurance companies or anything, I\r\nhad it all right there. That’s why I had those.\r\n\r\nQ: You found the filing cabinet but there was nothing in it?\r\n\r\nA: No. We went through it. There wasn’t a thing in it. Stan and I both.\r\n\r\nQ: They’d stripped it out, or was there other stuff in there...\r\n\r\nA: There wasn’t anything in there.\r\n\r\nQ: After all of that excitement, then what? Did it just kind of\r\nevaporate?\r\n\r\nA: It just kind of evaporated. Then of course two or three days later,\r\nI was concerned about her because she was sick. I took her back to the\r\nnurse’s quarters and let her out. I called back the next day and they\r\nsaid she wasn’t on duty, and I called the next day and they said she\r\nwasn’t on duty. Then I went out there, for some reason, I don’t recall.\r\nI went out there and I asked about the lieutenant, and they said she’d\r\nbeen transferred out. They said, “She was transferred out yesterday.”\r\nWell, that was the day after I saw her. They got her out the next day.\r\n\r\nQ: Who told you she’d been transferred out?\r\n\r\nA: I don’t know. Some nurses...\r\n\r\nQ: It wasn’t anybody that you remember?\r\n\r\nA: No.\r\n\r\nQ: Did they tell you where she’d been shipped to?\r\n\r\nA: They didn’t know. They said she had been transferred, and that’s all\r\nthey knew.\r\n\r\nQ: But then you heard from her subsequently.\r\n\r\nA: About three or four weeks later. I got a card addressed to Ballard\r\nFuneral Home. It was from her, and inside it just said, just a short\r\nnote, she said we will correspond later to see what happened to each\r\nother, something similar to those words. She said the only way you can\r\ncontact me is through this APO number, and there was an APO number. It\r\nwas a New York APO number.\r\n\r\nQ: So she’d gone to Europe or some place.\r\n\r\nA: Then right on the bottom she says, “I’m in London.” That was it. I\r\nwrote a note, just a note, that said if you feel like it and you get\r\ntime, then I would love to know and we’ll correspond. Mine came back.\r\nThat was about three or four weeks later. Mine came back.\r\n\r\nQ: That was the one that was marked deceased?\r\n\r\nA: Yes. It said return to sender, [addressee] deceased.\r\n\r\nQ: Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nA: (inaudible)\r\n\r\nQ: You didn’t try to follow up or see if there was any possible...\r\n\r\nA: No. I asked (inaudible), at the time we called her Slatts Wilson,\r\na big tall nurse, 6′2″, 6′3″, big tall skinny girl. We called her\r\nSlatts. Everybody called her Slatts. She’s the one that told me she’d\r\nheard that there was a plane crash and she was the nurse that went down\r\non a training mission. She said that’s strictly rumor, I don’t know\r\nanything about it. That’s what I...\r\n\r\nQ: No one’s been able to turn that one up at all.\r\n\r\nA: I guess maybe I should never even mention this. I know no one\r\nbelieves this damn story. Nobody believes this story.\r\n\r\nQ: I don’t know if that’s true.\r\n\r\nA: Anyway, it was a hell of a story. I told (inaudible). I said I told\r\nthe woman, I don’t want to give you her name, because I told the lady\r\nI’d give a sacred oath and I didn’t want to get involved. Well, it’s\r\nbeen 45 years, almost 40 years, and I haven’t heard anything. He said\r\nI will do it confidentially and nobody else will have this name. Well,\r\nthat’s where he broke his promise after that. I got all over him about\r\nit. I called him and I was madder than hell. He said well, Bob Shirkey\r\nwas the one that told everybody, that he was sitting in the back of\r\nus. Bob brought Stan [Friedman] up there when he interviewed me. He\r\nsaid, Bob Shirkey was the one that let out her name. To this day, Stan\r\nFriedman (inaudible) still says he did not put her name out. I’ve been\r\non several shows, not several, but two or three interviews, and I’m not\r\ngoing to mention her name. If somebody says is this her name? I’m not\r\ngoing to say it is or it isn’t. I told Stan ... I was madder than hell\r\nabout it, because I did give my word.\r\n\r\nQ: There’s another side to that, too, from the standpoint of those\r\nwho are trying to get some answers. By not having her name around,\r\nit makes it easier to cross-check the stories that you get from\r\npeople. You have... It’s a question of honor, and that’s very sound. I\r\napplaud you for that. There’s not too many people around these days\r\nthat are concerned about that kind of thing. And it’s also, from an\r\ninvestigator’s point of view, an advantage, too.\r\n\r\nA: I’ve never read this stuff, I’ve never watched the videos, I’ve\r\nnever read any books, I haven’t even read Stan’s books, I haven’t even\r\nread [Kevin] Randle’s only what they say about me. Friedman is a lot\r\nmore accurate, but see...\r\n\r\nQ: You mean about...\r\n\r\nA: About me. I’ve read that. That’s the only thing I’ve read. I’m\r\nnot a UFO guy. I’ve got another life besides UFOs. But anyway, Stan\r\nFriedman’s story is pretty well right. But Randle and them was always\r\nsaid I got curious. I didn’t get curious. I went out there on a call,\r\njust like I told you.\r\n\r\nQ: The section of their book that refers to you is really kind of\r\ncryptic, anyway.\r\n\r\nA: They said the book was already published. Now they had a copy...\r\nFriedman sent them a copy of my tape. They had the (inaudible). Hell,\r\nthey had my tape. They just made that up. Somebody did.\r\n\r\nQ: I was puzzled by it when I read their book. That whole section where\r\nthey refer to you, and it’s all very mysterious, and your name is not\r\nreferred to in the table of contents, but you’re in the list of people\r\nthat’s been interviewed, but you’re not one of the key people lists...\r\n\r\nA: They never did interview me.\r\n\r\nQ: They never talk to you at all?\r\n\r\nA: Not personally. They didn’t interview me until a long time later, a\r\nyear or so later. They only had Stan’s tape.\r\n\r\nQ: So when they were actually writing their book...\r\n\r\nA: The book was already published.\r\n\r\nQ: When they were doing the writing, they were working from Stan’s tape.\r\n\r\nA: Evidently.\r\n\r\nQ: Who was actually the first UFO investigator to get in touch with you?\r\n\r\nA: Stan Friedman. When they had Unsolved Mysteries here and different\r\nones. There was a lot of people... I’d get different ones. I had\r\ndifferent people come and say we want to talk to you about the UFOs,\r\nand I said I don’t have anything to say, I don’t want to talk about it,\r\nand I never did. I’ve talked to very few people since.\r\n\r\nQ: How did Stan come to find you?\r\n\r\nA: One of the guys that I went to school with, high school, and Captain\r\nHarry Blake, he’s a general now, (inaudible).\r\n\r\nQ: Is he still on active duty?\r\n\r\nA: No, he’s retired. He was just a general in the military school,\r\nNational Guard, I don’t know. He never was really a good friend of\r\nmine. We lived across the street from each other when we were kids.\r\n\r\nQ: So that’s how Stan found you. He was the first guy to talk to you.\r\n\r\nA: Bob Shirkey brought him up there to see me.\r\n\r\n(Pause)\r\n\r\nQ: There’s a reference in here to you having some years later, I think,\r\ntalked to a pediatrician that you knew? A guy that was stationed...\r\n\r\nA: I can’t find his picture, and I don’t remember his name. I ran into\r\nhim when I was fishing up in Colorado and we ran into each other.\r\n\r\nQ: This was a guy who was at that time stationed here?\r\n\r\nA: He was here, and they called him in. He said that was out of his\r\nfield and he didn’t want anything to do with it.\r\n\r\nQ: They actually called him in and asked him to take a look at what had\r\nbeen retrieved or...\r\n\r\nA: He said they called him in. I don’t know. He said, “But I said that\r\nwas out of my field and I didn’t want anything to do with it.” That’s\r\nwhat he told me, now.\r\n\r\nQ: Did you get the sense that he knew more than he was telling?\r\n\r\nA: I would say so, yeah. I’m sure they did. A lot of those guys out\r\nthere did.\r\n\r\nQ: You don’t remember his name?\r\n\r\nA: I don’t remember it. But I did run into him. Somewhere I’ve got his\r\nname.\r\n\r\nQ: Have you talked with anyone else? Had you during that time before\r\nyou got into all this...\r\n\r\nA: No, I wouldn’t have even talked to him about it. He brought it up\r\nand wanted to know whatever happened on the UFO business.\r\n\r\nQ: It was at his initiative.\r\n\r\nA: I didn’t bring it up. I told him I didn’t know any more about it\r\nthan he did. He said well that was strictly out of my field, and I\r\ndidn’t want to get involved in it. That was about it. But he brought it\r\nup. I didn’t ask him.\r\n\r\nQ: He was just curious about what happened.\r\n\r\nA: Wanted to know whatever happened to it.\r\n\r\nQ: That’s about all I’ve got.\r\n\r\n                                 (END)\r\n\r\n\r\n             Transcript of Interview with Alice Knight[*]\r\n                    (Alleged secondhand witness to\r\n                             “crash site”\r\n                    175 miles northwest of Roswell)\r\n\r\n  [*] Excerpted from raw footage used to prepare the video,\r\n  _Recollections of Roswell Part II_, (Washington, D.C.: Fund for UFO\r\n  Research, 1993).\r\n\r\nA: I remember that he saw—one time I went to visit—and I don’t remember\r\nwhether it was before my husband and I married or after, I don’t recall\r\nthe date. But he said that he saw a UFO fall. He was out working in the\r\nfield and I understood that he was out on the St. Agustin Plains and he\r\nwent over that way and it fell and he got nearly to the site and there\r\nwas a group of people on a geological—archeological hunt and they were\r\nover there. I don’t remember how many people he said.\r\n\r\nBut they got nearly up to the UFO but it was close enough that you\r\ncould see some creatures. He said they didn’t look like human beings\r\nout there.\r\n\r\nAnd along came government cars and trucks...\r\n\r\nQ: Now, by government you mean...\r\n\r\nA: I guess it was government. You know, as I said it was a long time\r\nago. And someone came along and I understood it, I don’t know whether\r\nit was army or what. I think he just termed it government trucks and\r\nthey told him to go on back and forget they ever saw anything, and\r\nthat’s all I recall.\r\n\r\n                                 (END)\r\n\r\n\r\n             Transcript of Interview with Vern Maltais[*]\r\n                    (Alleged secondhand witness to\r\n                             “crash site”\r\n                    175 miles northwest of Roswell)\r\n\r\n  [*] Excerpted from raw footage used to prepare the video.\r\n  _Recollections of Roswell Part II_, (Washington, D.C.: Fund for UFO\r\n  Research, 1993).\r\n\r\nA: ...he [the eyewitness] had been coming back from one of his field\r\ntrips, he’d run onto a flying saucer that had burst open and there\r\nwere four beings on the ground and that he was surveying the site,\r\narcheological group from the University of Pennsylvania, telling us\r\nthat there were about four or five people with this group.\r\n\r\nAs they were just starting to look things over really closely, the\r\nmilitary moved in and gave them a briefing not to say anything about it\r\nand keep quiet and it was in the national interest to get out of there.\r\n\r\nQ: What was his feeling about what it was that he had experienced?\r\n\r\nA: He had no qualms about what it was. He said it was a vehicle from\r\nouter space. There wasn’t any question. The beings on there were\r\nnothing like, not exactly like human beings....\r\n\r\nQ: How did you...\r\n\r\nA: ...similar but not exactly.\r\n\r\nQ: How did he describe them?\r\n\r\nA: He described them being about three and a half to four feet tall,\r\nvery slim in stature, and with—their heads were hairless, with no\r\neyebrows, no eyelashes, no hair. Sort of a pear-shaped head with the\r\ntop of the head being smaller—larger, I mean.\r\n\r\nQ: Any other characteristics about their appearance?\r\n\r\nA: Only one thing that he mentioned. The hands were not covered, they\r\nhad four fingers.\r\n\r\n                                 (END)\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Transcript of Interview with\r\n                           James Ragsdale[*]\r\n                     (Alleged firsthand witness to\r\n                    “crash site” north of Roswell)\r\n\r\n  [*] James Ragsdale, interview with Donald R.

Fisher?\r\n\r\nDS: Was it north of here.\r\n\r\nJR: Yes ... back out here.\r\n\r\nDS: Northwest ... Just take your time.\r\n\r\nJR: It was Foster. (Some discussion with his wife about who owned the\r\nranch) ... Let me see what you’ve got (referring to the photographs).\r\nThat’s the place right there (identifying the location from the\r\npictures).\r\n\r\nDS: What area?\r\n\r\nJR: It seemed to me that that place belonged to ... Fisher, but it sold\r\nto somebody else ... somebody else bought that... That’s how come I was\r\nout in that area. And we was out there and she’s dead and all the guys\r\nI showed the stuff are all dead. It’s amazing what all went on...\r\n\r\nDiscuss our book and the Museum.\r\n\r\nDS: showing one of the pictures ... so you think this looks like\r\n\r\nJR: That looks like the place.\r\n\r\nDS: As far as the ranches go, driving around at that time, it could\r\nhave been most any ranch, right? This would have been in '47 ... You\r\nwere with this woman?\r\n\r\nJR: Yeah. We were camped out out there.\r\n\r\nDS: You were camping?\r\n\r\nJR: Yeah... I would say half of it ... I would say that only about\r\nhalf of it ... just half of a ... you really couldn’t tell what it\r\nwas ... what you could still see, where it hit ... I think it was two\r\nspaceships flying together and one them came down and the other one\r\npicked up what they could and got out of there.\r\n\r\nDS: Is it possible that because it was hit by lightning that it broke\r\nup and part of it went down ... (discussion of the Mac Brazel sighting)\r\n\r\nJR: ... but it was either dummies or bodies or something laying there.\r\nThey looked like bodies. They weren’t very long ... over four or five\r\nfoot long at the most. We didn’t see their faces or nothing like that\r\nbut we had just got to the site and heard the army, the sirens, all\r\ncoming and we got into a damned jeep to take off. We had to hold a\r\nfence up to go onto another ranch to come out from there.\r\n\r\nDS: How far would you say this from town here?\r\n\r\nJR: Thirty miles ... forty miles.\r\n\r\nDS: In a northwesterly direction?\r\n\r\nJR: Right up here. (Discuss the pictures again.)\r\n\r\nDS: Were there any buildings?\r\n\r\nJR: No. You couldn’t see nothing. You go up on top of the hill. It was\r\na hill ... (referring to the pictures) you could see the stuff right\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nDS: The object ... the craft ... what was left of it ... in these\r\nphotos ... where was the object?\r\n\r\nJR: Along this right here ... It looked to be about half of around (?)\r\nbecause around the edges ... I had two great big pieces. That’s what\r\nthey got when they stole the car ... you could take that stuff and wad\r\nit up and it would straighten itself out. I never seen anything like\r\nit. Looked like something between a plastic ... looked like carbon\r\npaper...\r\n\r\nDS: That was the color of it?\r\n\r\nJR: Yeah. Carbons. That was the color of it. Sure was ... between\r\nplastic and ... hell I don’t know ... let’s see how to describe. One\r\npiece we had you could take it and put it in any form you wanted and it\r\nwould stay there ... you could bend it in any form and it would stay\r\n... it wouldn’t straighten back out.\r\n\r\nDS: You picked those up from the ground?\r\n\r\nJR: Yeah.\r\n\r\nDS: You threw them in the jeep ... stuffed them in your clothes...?\r\n\r\nJR: Yeah and then we heard all of them coming...\r\n\r\nDS: How many vehicles ... how much commotion did you hear as they came\r\nin?\r\n\r\nJR: Oh my God it must have been ... it was two or three six by six\r\narmy trucks, a wrecker and everything ... and leading the pack was a\r\n'47 Ford car with guys in it ... MPs and stuff in it ... we had the\r\nwindshield down on the jeep and we stayed in the weeds and stuff ...\r\nand we came on back down to where we was camped at.\r\n\r\nDS: So you watched for a while?\r\n\r\nJR: Yeah. Sure did.\r\n\r\nDS: What was their...\r\n\r\nJR: They cleaned everything all up. I mean cleaned it. They raked the\r\nground and everything. I mean they cleaned everything.\r\n\r\nDS: You didn’t stay there that long?\r\n\r\nJR: No, but they had a truck. I would say it was six or eight big\r\ntrucks besides the pick up, weapons carriers and stuff like that.\r\n\r\nDS: What kind of guard did they have. Did they surround certain areas...\r\n\r\nJR: They had MPs all ... they got way out in the field. They had people\r\nall along this ridge ... they drove up in here. We was back over here.\r\nThis grass here...\r\n\r\nDS: So if you were back here, could you see the activity down here?\r\n\r\nJR: You couldn’t see too much of what they ... you could tell ... As\r\nsoon as they got there they began gathering the stuff up ... we were\r\nhidden in what you call buffalo grass...\r\n\r\nDS: Did you see any behavior around the bodies.\r\n\r\nJR: Huh-uh.\r\n\r\nDS: You couldn’t see down to that level?\r\n\r\nJR: Yeah.\r\n\r\nDS: Did you see any activity near the craft?\r\n\r\nJR: No.\r\n\r\nDS: The angle of the craft ... was it flat was tipped...\r\n\r\nJR: One part was kind of buried in the ground ... and part of it was\r\nsticking out of the ground ... about like that (DS: about a 30 degree\r\nangle?) Yeah ... and I’m sure that was bodies ... either bodies or\r\ndummies...\r\n\r\nDS: Why do you say “dummies?”\r\n\r\nJR: The federal government could have been doing something because they\r\ndidn’t want anyone to know what this was ... they was using dummies in\r\nthose damned things ... they could use remote control.\r\n\r\nDS: So you thought that it could have been an experimental craft?\r\n\r\nJR: After I came to town showed Frank Willis and his son (he’s dead)\r\n... the Blue Moon beer joint over on the old Dexter highway. We was\r\nthere until two o’clock in the morning ... I had the jeep behind my car.\r\n\r\nDS: Did you still have the scrap in the jeep?\r\n\r\nJR: Yeah. I showed it to him. He said I would just keep my mouth shut\r\n... he said hell there is no telling where that come from.\r\n\r\nDS: So you didn’t think it was from outer space?\r\n\r\nJR: No. We didn’t even think about outer space back then...\r\n\r\nDS: When was the first time that you thought that maybe this was\r\nsomething more?\r\n\r\nJR: It was about three weeks ... it came out that a spaceship had\r\ncrashed at Roswell ... about three weeks. But it could have been out\r\nlonger than that there but see I worked in Carlsbad...\r\n\r\nDS: But you first saw there had been a newspaper article about three\r\nweeks after...\r\n\r\nJR: Oh hell it was two or three weeks before I caught up on it ... a\r\nspaceship ... what I hear is they guarded that place for a long time\r\nout there ... because me and another fellow went out there and you\r\ncouldn’t get ... they had the roads sealed off ... it was a month or so\r\nafter...\r\n\r\nDS: And they still had it cordoned off.\r\n\r\nJR: The MPs and stuff were still on the road. They wouldn’t let nobody\r\ngo out there...\r\n\r\nDS: If a person were to drive out there today ... going north out of\r\ntown ... are we talking 285?\r\n\r\nJR: No. Highway 48. You go out 48. You go out here to the truck route,\r\nhit 48 and ... and it’s about forty some miles out in there ... (And no\r\ntalks about the car being stolen in 1951 when the car with the debris\r\nwas stolen...) ...I would say 18 inches and 30 inches long ... strips\r\noff the edge of it ... it was a heavy material but it didn’t have no\r\nridges ... it was put together with some kind of solder like stuff ...\r\nno bumps, no nothing in it ... it wasn’t ... it was about as heavy as\r\nduraluminum ... it wasn’t as brittle ... you could take a small piece\r\nand it was flexible ... (then discuss the stealing of the car with a\r\nwrecker and the material was locked in the trunk of the car. And then\r\ndiscuss the break in of the house where the last of the pieces were\r\nstolen about eight years ago ... 1985).\r\n\r\nDS: Was there a storm that night?”\r\n\r\nJR: Yeah. There sure was. It was a whale of a storm.\r\n\r\nDS: Did you hear anything unusual? Did you hear ... between the cracks\r\nof thunder...\r\n\r\nJR: Well, it lit up the sky when it came down. It lit up the damned ...\r\nwe thought at first that it was falling star or something. And electric\r\nlightning ... man it was something.\r\n\r\nDS: You heard something and you saw something...\r\n\r\nJR: Yeah, sure did ... because we were laying there in the back of the\r\npick up ... the whole sky lit up ... we thought it was a star falling.\r\n\r\nDS: Did you then go to check it out...\r\n\r\nJR: Sure did. The next day, sure did. We drove right up on it. She\r\npicked up a piece of it and we had the jeep parked a little ways away\r\nfrom there and throwed a piece of it up there somewhere and I have\r\ntried and tried to find where she had throwed that piece ... she had a\r\npiece but when she saw the army coming she throwed it out ... she saw\r\nthem a coming and she throwed it out ... I doubt that I could even go\r\nback to the place it’s been so long. (Now begin to talk about the car\r\nwreck that nearly killed him.)\r\n\r\nRemainder of the tape is discussion about the car wreck, the ranchers\r\nin the area, and the murder of Mrs. Ragsdale’s brother.\r\n\r\n                                 (END)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Selected Bibliography of Technical Reports\r\n\r\n\r\nThe technical reports listed below are available for sale by contacting:\r\n    National Technical Information Service (NTIS)\r\n    5285 Port Royal Rd\r\n    Springfield, VA 22161\r\n    (703) 487-4650\r\n    http://www.orders@ntis.fedworld.gov\r\n\r\n         Publication                                  NTIS Report Number\r\n\r\n  Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories.\r\n    “Report on Research, for the Period July\r\n    1965-June 1967”, AFCRL TR-68-0039, 1968.
